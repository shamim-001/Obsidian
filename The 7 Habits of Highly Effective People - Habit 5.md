## Habit 5: Listen and Understand the Other First

**Habit Description:**

- When communicating with others, try to understand _their_ perspective before asking them to understand _yours_; only then can you find a mutually beneficial solution.

### Why It Matters

We discussed in Habit 4 that an essential step in reaching a mutually beneficial solution is to try to understand the other person’s perspective and concerns. **The key to understanding people is to listen with _the intent to grasp their perspectives_**; this is empathic listening. Empathic listening involves not only hearing people’s words but also paying attention to their nonverbal cues, like their posture, gestures, and cadence.

(Shortform note: Empathic listening is a cornerstone of Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a communication framework that is [rooted in compassion and understanding](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-1-2-14) and outlined in the book, _[Nonviolent Communication](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/)_. Author Marshall B. Rosenberg developed and used NVC in his work with civil rights activists and school desegregationists in the 1960s.)

As your empathic listening improves, you’ll progress through the four stages of empathic listening.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Description**|**Pros**|**Cons**|**Example**|
|**Stage 1**|Mimicking, or repeating a person’s words back to them (also called “active” or “reflective” listening)|You’re actively listening to what the other person is saying.<br><br>You avoid responses that focus on yourself.|This is not very effective for problem-solving, because you’re only repeating the information—not processing it.<br><br>If you don’t have a solid relationship with the other person or show a genuine interest in what she’s saying, mimicry can come off as insulting.|Your spouse says, “I hate this job. It’s just wasting my time.”<br><br>You respond, “You can’t stand your job. You feel like it’s a waste of time”|
|**Stage 2**|Rephrasing the content|You have to actually process what the other person said.|Your response is dominantly logic-oriented; it doesn’t address the other person’s emotions.|In response to your spouse, you say, “You’re tired of your job and you don’t think it will help you in your career path.”|
|**Stage 3**|Reflecting the feelings the person is expressing|You pick up on how the other person is feeling, which helps you begin to understand their perspective.|Your response is based in emotion; it doesn’t incorporate logic.|Your response to your spouse is, “You’re feeling frustrated and exasperated.”|
|**Stage 4**|Combining Stages 2 and 3: Rephrasing what the other person is saying and also reflecting their feelings|You integrate emotion and logic to better understand the other person.<br><br>In the long run, you save time and effort by avoiding misunderstandings.|You must invest more time and energy on the front end to understand the person’s perspective.|You respond to your spouse, “Your job is making you feel frustrated and exasperated, and you don’t think it will help you in your career path.”|

> **_Effective_ Listening Requires More Than Empathy**
> 
> Subsequent research found that effective listening requires more than what Covey has suggested. (It’s worth noting that this research studied effective—but not specifically _empathic_—listening.) Most notably, this research found that [effective listening involves a lot of responding](https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do), but the responses must be supportive and constructive. The study even found that effective listeners often give advice, but that the feedback clearly reflects that the listener thoroughly understands what the speaker is saying.
> 
> The authors of the study, leadership consultants and authors Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman, list [six levels of listening](https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do), some of which overlap with Covey’s stages of empathic listening:
> 
> - **Create a safe space** for the speaker to share their thoughts and feelings.
>     
> - **Put away distractions** like phones and make eye contact with the speaker; besides making the speaker feel heard, these actions also make you, the listener, more attentive.
>     
> - **Logically understand what the speaker is saying.** Ask questions or reiterate to ensure that you have an accurate understanding. (This is comparable to Covey’s Stage 2.)
>     
> - **Interpret the speaker’s nonverbal cues**, including posture, facial expressions, and cadence. (Covey gives this overarching advice, but doesn’t associate it with a specific stage of listening.)
>     
> - **Aim to understand how the speaker feels** about what they’re saying; support and validate those emotions. (In isolation, this is comparable to Covey’s Stage 3, but Zenger and Folkman’s descriptions suggest that each of these levels incorporates the attributes of the previous levels. In that case, Level 5’s emotional understanding is layered on top of Level 2’s logical comprehension, which would make this parallel to Covey’s Stage 4.)
>     
> - **Contribute to the conversation** by asking questions, offering insight, or giving advice that could help the listener develop a new perspective or solution. These contributions must focus on the speaker and the issue at hand, rather than diverting the focus to the listener.
>     

Once you reach Stage 4, your empathic listening will improve your outcomes because:

1. **You get more accurate “data” to help you come up with a mutually beneficial solution.** You gain a more accurate understanding of others’ views and feelings, rather than your own skewed interpretation.
2. **You build trust.** When people recognize that you’re genuinely trying to understand them, they’re more inclined to trust you and to open up, which adds to mutual goodwill.
3. **You improve the other person’s ability to problem-solve.** Empathic listening helps people feel understood, affirmed, appreciated, and validated, which gives them the mental space to process the problem. When people don’t have the mental and emotional space they need, they struggle to think and act logically.
4. **You make the other person more inclined to understand your perspective.** As a result of benefits #2 and #3, the other person becomes more willing and able to understand your view in return. That gives you the groundwork for a mutually beneficial solution.

> **Empathy Is a Key to Good Leadership**
> 
> The four benefits Covey lists indicate why the idea of empathic listening has become so popular among leaders: Leaders are continually looking for ways to get better data, build trust with employees, improve their employees' problem-solving abilities, and express themselves in an accessible, understandable way.
> 
> Aside from negotiations, such [empathy is critical for leaders](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-try-a-new-strategy-empathy-1466501403) to understand their team members’ wants and needs, so that they know the best ways to rally and support the team. In _Nonviolent Communication_, Rosenberg agrees that **empathic listening makes it [easier for you to relate](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-7-8) to the other person on a human level**, since you’re focused on [understanding their observations, feelings, needs, and requests](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-7-8).
> 
> Supporting your team empathetically is what Michael Brenner has dubbed [Champion Leadership](https://meanpeoplesuck.com/how-champion-leaders-foster-innovation/) in his book _[Mean People Suck](https://meanpeoplesuck.com/book/)_. Brenner—a business consultant, CEO, and bestselling author—posits that champion leadership leads to more engaged employees, greater innovation, and better business outcomes.

### How To

To master this habit, Covey suggests you make a point of spending one-on-one time with people and building your level of trust and goodwill. Additionally, practice empathic listening with these exercises:

- **Spend quality time with your child.** Listen and try to understand things from their perspective (which will differ from yours on two levels: as a unique individual, and also as a child who understands the world differently than an adult would).
- **Have one-on-one work meetings with your employees and colleagues.** Aim to understand their day-to-day realities, challenges, and concerns.
- **People-watch to practice interpreting nonverbal cues.** Observe an interaction from afar. What can you discern about their emotions based solely on their body language?
- **Ask a friend or family member for feedback.** Explain the concept of empathic listening, and ask them to tell you in a week how well you listened empathically to them.
- **Practice switching views.** Next time you have to explain your perspective, first try to describe the situation from the other person’s perspective. Then, explain _your_ point through _their_ lens.

> **Practice Empathic Listening**
> 
> While Covey’s suggested exercises allow you to practice empathic listening, he doesn’t provide many specific strategies to be successful at it. First, consider these [tips for empathic listening](https://www.crisisprevention.com/Blog/7-Tips-for-Empathic-Listening) from the Crisis Prevention Center:
> 
> - **Signal that you're listening** with your body language and gestures like nodding.
>     
> - **Withhold your judgments.** You don’t have to _agree_ with the other person, but you must release your opinions long enough to understand the other person’s perspective.
>     
> - **Paraphrase what you think the other person is saying**, and ask them if you’re correct. (NVC recommends [paraphrasing in the form of a question](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-7-8), such as, “Are you feeling **_ _because you need_** ?”)
>     
> - **Embrace silence.** Sometimes your presence is enough to make the other person feel supported. Also, be careful not to interrupt or respond too quickly if the other person needs time to think.
>     
> - **Don’t cut the conversation short.** Make sure the other person has expressed everything they wanted to say. You may need to set up another time to talk more.
>     
> 
> Additionally, NVC lists [several common responses that you should avoid](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-7-8), because they engage with the speaker _intellectually_ rather than empathically:
> 
> - Offering advice (“You should try …”)
>     
> - Consoling (“It wasn’t your fault.”)
>     
> - Correcting (“Maybe you misunderstood.”)
>     
> - Educating (“There’s a valuable lesson in this.”)
>     
> - Interrogating (“How did that happen?”)
>     
> - One-upping (“I’ve dealt with something worse.”)
>     
> - Shutting down (“Don’t worry so much.”)
>     
> - Storytelling (“My friend had a similar situation …”)
>     
> - Sympathizing (“I’m sorry you’re going through that.”)
>     

### Going Deeper

As discussed, when you try to understand others, it encourages them to do the same toward you—and you can help them to understand you by communicating who you are, how you feel, and what you think. Specifically, Covey argues that the key to helping others understand you is to use the Greek rhetorical philosophy of ethos, pathos, and logos, in that order.

- **Ethos is your integrity and credibility**, which makes people trust you.
- **Pathos deals with feelings**; you must be on the same page emotionally as the person you’re communicating with. To be on the same page, you need to first understand the other person’s feelings and perspectives, which requires empathic listening.
- **Logos invokes logic**, which is the information and reasoning for your perspective.

> **How to Communicate With Empathy**
> 
> Effectively communicating, as Covey suggests, requires as much finesse and technique as empathic listening—but, again, Covey doesn’t provide actionable strategies. Here, Nonviolent Communication outlines specific [tips for empathic expression](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-3-6) in four steps:
> 
> - **Observe without evaluating.** This involves making specific, observable statements rather than using labels or generalizations. For example, say, “I was still speaking” rather than, “That was rude” or “You always cut me off.”
>     
> - **Identify and express your feelings.** Once you’ve made your observation, build on it by sharing your feelings. To clarify, feelings should describe your physical or emotional state, not your feelings or thoughts _about_ something.
>     
> - **Connect your feelings to your needs.** Every feeling arises because a certain need (such as autonomy or acceptance) is or isn’t being met. Identify what need is underlying the feeling you named, so that you’re clear about your goals for this communication.
>     
> - **Make specific requests.** Once you identify what you need, ask the other person for exactly what you want. A few tips:
>     
>     - Tell them what you _do_ want, rather than what you _don’t_ want.
>         
>     - Be specific. Asking simply for “help” leaves them to interpret what that entails.
>         
>     - Make requests, not demands. The other person should feel free to say “no” without backlash.
>         
>     - Make sure the other person understands by asking them to reflect back what you’ve said in their own words.
