## Chapter 3: Ability and Achievement

**Many people have wrong ideas about ability and achievement**. For instance, they picture Thomas Edison working long hours alone in a small lab, when he suddenly invents the lightbulb in a “Eureka!” moment..

But that’s not how it happened. He had dozens of assistants working for him in a large corporate-funded lab. The successful lightbulb was the end result of a string of inventions, to which chemists, physicists, engineers, and many others contributed. Edison had a true growth mindset and drive to learn and tackle new challenges.

While ability helps, achievement comes through learning and effort. Likewise, Darwin’s book, _The Origin of Species_, was the product of numerous drafts and conversations with countless colleagues over many years. Mozart worked more than ten years before producing notable work.

This chapter explains what achievement really takes and why some people achieve more and others less.

### Achievement in School

**Achievement in school starts with mindset.** Researchers measured students’ mindsets as they transitioned to junior high school, which is a particularly challenging time for adolescents, then followed them for two years.

The students started out with similar grades but after the transition with its new challenges, the grades of fixed-mindset students declined, while those of growth-oriented students improved.

The fixed-mindset students tried to rationalize their poor grades with explanations such as “I’m no good at math” or they blamed the teacher. They viewed the change to junior high as threatening because it could expose them as failures. **They protected themselves from failure by not trying (the low-effort syndrome)**, as the young Juilliard violinist did by not taking her violin to class.

In contrast, the growth-minded students faced the tougher environment by doubling down and working harder. They welcomed the opportunity to learn what they like and might achieve.

> Aside: A famous example of doubling down is the experience of George Danzig, a math graduate student at Berkeley. Once, he arrived late as his math class was ending and hurriedly copied two problems from the blackboard that he assumed were the assignment. They were quite difficult and it took him days of effort to solve them. It turns out that they weren’t intended to be homework problems, but were two famous problems no one had ever solved.

### Achievement in College

The transition to college is another crisis point in young people’s development. They go from being top students in their high school to having to prove themselves among top students from many high schools.

Anxiety is especially high in the pre-med classes. In the study of pre-med students facing the gateway chemistry course, there were big differences in how students with each mindset approached the course and in their achievement.

Everyone studied, but the two groups studied differently. The students with fixed mindsets studied the way many students have learned to study: they re-read the text and their notes and memorized as much as they could. They believed they’d done everything possible — maybe they just weren’t good at chemistry. But instead of memorizing the material, **the growth-minded students looked for themes and principles** across lectures. They worked to understand their mistakes — they wanted to learn, not just to excel on a test.

As a result, the growth-oriented students got higher grades than the fixed-minded students. The more difficult the material became, the harder they worked, motivating themselves and staying positive.

### Mindset Versus Ability

Mindset clearly can have a huge impact on learning and achievement.

Ability is also a factor. All children aren’t created equal — some have greater ability and become prodigies by building on their ability, seeking challenges and pursuing a love of learning. However, everyone has interests that can grow into abilities if nurtured. As noted previously, no one really knows anyone else’s potential. **While abilities vary, your mindset determines where you go with them**.

There are many examples of great academic achievement by children with few resources, who were thought to have dead-ended until a growth-minded teacher showed them that they could learn. For example, as recounted in the movie _Stand and Deliver_, **teacher Jaime Escalante taught advanced calculus to inner-city Hispanic high school students in Los Angeles**.

Other teachers had concluded they couldn’t learn, while Escalante asked himself _how_ they could learn and how he could teach them. His students ultimately excelled and more of them took advanced placement tests than did students from elite science high schools. Escalante’s experience raises the question of how much is lost when we underestimate students’ potential.

Researcher Benjamin Bloom, who studied outstanding achievers, concluded that almost all people can learn under the right conditions, including support, commitment, and motivation.

#### Teachers’ Mindsets Matter

A German research study showed that **teachers with different mindsets get different results.** Fixed-mindset teachers thought abilities were set in stone. They believed they knew their students’ intelligence and potential. In their classrooms, students ended the school year in the same ability group they started in.

In contrast, teachers with a growth mindset believed all students could improve. Their students all improved no matter which ability group they started in. As the year progressed, group differences disappeared.

Teaching from a fixed mindset hinders student achievement and puts teachers in the role of judging students, rather than of allies helping them to learn and succeed.

### Artistic Ability

We often think of artistic ability as a gift, rather than something that can be learned like verbal or logical thinking skills. However, Betty Edwards, author of _Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_, showed that drawing ability can be developed. Her book showed before and after self-portraits drawn by students of her five-day course. The “after” portraits were much better. Edwards taught students to see such aspects as relationships, light and shadow, and spaces and to combine them into a whole.

Edwards’ work shows that **while some people have a natural ability to do something without training, others can nonetheless do it _with_ training, sometimes even better.**

A commitment to working to improve your skills is also important, and can be the difference between a great artist and an average one. Choreographer and dancer Twyla Tharp argued in her book, _The Creative Habit_, that creativity comes from work and commitment. She didn’t believe in “natural” genius.

American artist Jackson Pollock exemplified Tharp’s premise. He had little innate artistic talent but became a great painter, transforming modern art. He excelled because of his single-minded dedication to art — he painted all the time and sought out mentors, from whom he learned basic techniques. He ultimately invented a technique of his own called “poured” painting, in which paint is first poured onto a canvas, then manipulated by the painter.

### Labeling

While labeling people negatively according to their perceived potential is often inaccurate and can hinder their development, **positive labeling and praise can also be detrimental**.

Parents and teachers typically try to build children’s self-confidence by praising their ability, but this can be harmful. **Praising their ability sends the message that adults value ability and can determine a child’s ability from his or her performance**. This is a fixed mindset. Here’s how it plays out.

Researchers gave early adolescent students ten problems to solve, then praised their performance in two different ways: some students were praised for their ability (“You must be smart at this”), while another group was praised for their effort (“It looks like you worked really hard”).

**Praising students for their ability pushed them into a fixed mindset.** When offered another difficult task that they could learn from, they rejected it, not wanting to show any cracks in their talent by failing. However, the students who were praised for effort (a growth-minded approach) wanted to take on the new challenge.

Researchers then gave all the students new problems, on which they didn’t do well. The children praised for ability began feeling like failures — they’d been told that their earlier success meant they were smart so now they felt stupid. Their performance steadily declined. In contrast, the students who were praised for effort tried harder and their performance continued to improve.

What’s more, when asked to write a report on the experience, almost 40 percent of the children praised for their ability lied about their performance. **Telling children they were smart hurt their performance and turned them into liars**.

#### Negative Labels

**A fixed mindset that stereotypes groups of people with negative labels undercuts their performance**. For instance, this affects girls who are told they’re bad at math and science, and African Americans who are stereotyped as less intelligent.

**A study showed that checking a box indicating your race or sex before taking a test can remind you of the stereotypes surrounding those labels and lower your score if you have a fixed mindset.** In growth-minded students, the stereotype doesn’t affect performance. Further, the study showed that students perform equally when no stereotypes are invoked.

Researchers theorized that the stereotypes distracted and worried fixed-minded students, detracting from their ability to concentrate on the test. It also suggested **a growth mindset can help students counteract negative labels when they encounter them**.

Stereotypes also hinder people’s development by making them feel they don’t belong — in a certain college, program, course, or occupation. Many women and minorities drop out of environments where they feel they’re not fitting in, especially if they have a fixed mindset.

#### Vulnerability to Opinion

Besides dealing with stereotyping, many girls and women struggle with others’ opinions in general. The reason is that when girls are young, adults praise them for being cute or perfect, which teaches them to trust others’ opinions of whether they’re good or bad. They carry this trust into adulthood — even women at top universities say other people’s opinions are a good way to know their abilities.

Often, boys are less susceptible to others’ opinions because adults criticize and scold boys more than girls, and many boys are also accustomed to insulting and calling each other names (slob or idiot). Consequently, boys learn to shrug off the opinions of others.

The gender gap in math and science is no doubt widened by fixed mindsets as well as stereotyping. These fields need to be more friendly to women — and women would benefit from learning a growth mindset to overcome negative messages and labels about girls’ abilities to succeed in these fields.

### Change Your Mindset: Tips

- Research a hero to learn about all the effort that led to their success. Few people succeed on talent alone.
- The next time someone outperforms you, don’t just assume they’re smarter. Consider the strategies, training, and effort they applied and how you could apply the same effort next time.
- Next time you’re tempted to label your kids for their ability (artist, musician, athlete), choose a growth-minded way to praise them that focuses on effort and improvement instead.
- When you work with women and minorities as a teacher, colleague, or manager, model and teach a growth mindset that with support and effort, anyone can improve.
