## 1-Page Summary

In _[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People/Stephen-R-Covey/9781982137137)_, Stephen R. Covey distills timeless wisdom into **seven lifelong practices for building a successful, fulfilling life**. Rather than small, daily actions like brushing your teeth, these habits are patterns of thinking and acting that represent a broader approach to life. They are:

- Habit 1: Take Initiative
- Habit 2: Envision the Life You Want
- Habit 3: Prioritize Important Over Urgent
- Habit 4: Seek Mutual Benefits
- Habit 5: Listen and Understand the Other First
- Habit 6: Collaborate to Create Possibilities
- Habit 7: Practice Self-Renewal

Collectively, Covey’s seven habits help you to examine and adjust your character, your motives, and how you see the world in order to become more effective both personally and professionally.

(Shortform note: In the evolution of self-help books, _7 Habits_ takes a _character-focused_ approach to self-improvement—changing perspective and motivation in order to alter behavior—amid a sea of _behavior-focused_ self-help classics like _[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people)_, which share practical tips to conduct yourself differently.)

### The Habits: Defining the Approach and Goal

Before we dive into the habits, let’s examine Covey’s approach and goal for readers who adopt the seven habits.

#### The Method: Shifting Perspectives

Covey writes that changing your behaviors and your life requires you to change your paradigms, or perspectives. Your perspectives impact how you interpret situations, and your interpretations dictate your behavior; thus, **changing your _perspective_ changes your _behavior_**. Taking this a step further, your behaviors determine your outcomes, which collectively shape your life.

(Shortform note: Covey doesn’t specify _how_ to change your perspectives. James Allen argues in _[As A Man Thinketh](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/As-a-Man-Thinketh/James-Allen/9781440551185)_ that problems arise from negative thinking, so you should [think positively](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/as-a-man-thinketh/take-control-of-your-thoughts) to improve your perspective and reality. Alternatively, in _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Awaken-the-Giant-Within/Tony-Robbins/9780671791544)_, Tony Robbins asserts that changing your perspective requires [reprogramming your neuro-associations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-3)—good or bad feelings linked to people and situations based on your past experiences.)

#### The Tool: Habits

Covey distills his advice into habits in order to:

- Make it actionable (Shortform note: While this was the intention, many of the habits and strategies are still abstract. In these cases, we’ve supplemented them with more specific tips.)
- Emphasize that these are supposed to be lifelong practices—not one-time fixes (Shortform note: When a behavior becomes habit, it is [embedded into your subconscious](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/make-it-stick/1), which puts that behavior on autopilot. This ensures that you continue the behavior long term, and it leaves your conscious mind free to tackle other things.)

#### The Goal: Effectiveness

The seven habits aim to make you _effective_, which means that you target your efforts to get the most important things done, thus raising the quality of your accomplishments. (Shortform note: Covey’s emphasis on effectiveness was likely inspired by Peter F. Drucker, who argued in 1966 that [success as a business leader requires effectiveness](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/introduction).)

According to Covey, a cornerstone of effective living is interdependence, which means that you can take care of your needs but you recognize that you can achieve more through collaboration. (Shortform note: While Covey focuses on developing interdependence as an _individual_, John C. Maxwell describes similar traits among successful leaders. In _[The 5 Levels of Leadership](https://www.centerstreet.com/titles/john-c-maxwell/the-5-levels-of-leadership/9781599953656/)_, Maxwell writes that the most effective leaders—those at [Level 4](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-4) and [Level 5](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-5)—combine their leadership skills with their team members’ talents for collaborative greatness.)

Now, let’s dive into the habits. Habits 1-3 focus on personal effectiveness, while 4-6 stress effectiveness through collaboration. For clarity, we present each habit in the same format:

- Habit Description: A brief description of the main idea
- Why It Matters: An explanation of the idea’s significance and merit
- How To: Strategies for putting the principle into practice

### Habit 1: Take Initiative

#### Habit Description

Take initiative (Covey labels this habit “be proactive”). In other words, change the problems that you can change and accept the ones you can’t.

#### Why It Matters

According to Covey, Habit 1 lays the foundation for the subsequent habits because taking initiative is key to adopting new behaviors. Rather than being _reactive_ (externally influenced) and allowing your environment or circumstances dictate how you feel and act, being _proactive_ (initiative-taking) empowers you to choose your thoughts and actions.

(Shortform note: Taking initiative entails taking control of your actions and your responses to circumstances—and positive psychology researcher Shawn Achor asserts that [feeling in control makes you happier](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage/principle-5), more motivated, less stressed, physically healthier, and better at communicating and problem-solving.)

#### How To

For each of your concerns, determine which category it falls into, and act accordingly.

1. If it’s related to your actions, alter your behavior. (Shortform note: Robbins argues that behavior changes require altering your [Master System](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/part-2-chapter-11), which comprises your [mental and emotional state](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-5), [self-talk](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-6), [values](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-12), [beliefs](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-4), and [memories](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-14).)
2. If it’s related to _other people’s_ actions, alter your interactions with them in hopes of influencing their behavior. (Shortform note: One way to do this is to use [social proof](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-4)—if you want someone to do something, emphasize that others are already doing it.)
3. If it’s something you can’t impact, like the past, accept it. (Shortform note: One strategy is to [engage in the present moment](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living) instead of dwelling on the problem.)

### Habit 2: Envision the Life You Want

#### Habit Description

Determine who you want to be and what’s important to you, and keep these goals front-of-mind with a personal mission statement. (Shortform note: Goal-setting theory confirms that creating [specific, challenging goals improves performance.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232501090_A_Theory_of_Goal_Setting_Task_Performance))

#### Why It Matters

Covey argues that you have to imagine the life you want before you can achieve it. Vividly envisioning your goal keeps you focused on your destination amid daily demands and distractions. (Shortform note: Robbins takes Covey’s point a step further, arguing that intensely focusing on your goals also works on a _subconscious_ level by [triggering a sort of radar](https://extension.umn.edu/two-you-video-series/ras) in your brain that directs your attention to resources that can help you achieve those goals.)

#### How To

Habit 2 is a two-part process:

1. Identify _who_ you want to be and _what_ you want to do; picture yourself at the end of your life and reflect on what kind of impact and legacy you want to leave. (Shortform note: Alternatively, organizational psychologist Benjamin Hardy suggests imagining what you’d do [if you had only one month to live](https://www.inc.com/benjamin-p-hardy/this-quick-mental-exercise-will-bring-you-immediat.html), but you couldn’t tell anyone. What if you had one year? Five years? What would you prioritize for each prognosis?)
2. Write a personal mission statement that details who you are, your long-term goals, and the values you want to live by. Review and revise this mission statement regularly.

> **Checklist of an Effective Personal Mission Statement**
> 
> Personal mission statements are as unique as the people who write them. But, in _First Things First_, Covey lists several [characteristics that every effective mission statement should have](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first/chapter-5):
> 
> - It recognizes and incorporates your unique talents.
>     
> - It guides you to contribute to a higher purpose beyond yourself.
>     
> - It addresses your physical, social, mental, and spiritual needs.
>     
> - It balances your personal, family, work, and community roles.
>     
> - It inspires you.
>     

### Habit 3: Prioritize Important Over Urgent

#### Habit Description

Prioritize your time and actions in order to live up to your personal mission statement. (Shortform note: To help you apply Covey’s advice, we’ve included organizational strategies later in this guide from the more detailed, systematic approach described in _[Getting Things Done](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/1-page-summary)_.)

#### Why It Matters

To prioritize the tasks that will have the biggest positive impact on your life, Covey promotes a time management matrix originally designed by President Eisenhower that categorizes tasks based on their urgency and importance (meaning that they contribute to your goals, values, and personal mission statement). The matrix has four task categories, which Covey refers to as quadrants:

1. Category 1: Urgent and Important—The crises and problems in this category eat up your time and distract you from preventing future crises, creating a vicious cycle.
2. Category 2: Not Urgent, but Important—This is where you should spend most of your time, because it includes activities that could easily be put off, but that bring great benefits in the long term (like exercising).
3. Category 3: Urgent, but not Important—These activities are typically things that _other people_ want you to do but that aren’t important to _you_.
4. Category 4: Neither Urgent nor Important—These leisure and entertainment activities contribute nothing to your life, and effective people tend to avoid them.

> **Develop Time Management _Skills_ to Complement the _Tools_**
> 
> Research suggests that this matrix is a useful _tool_, but it doesn’t develop all of the [three skills necessary for effective time management](https://hbr.org/2020/01/time-management-is-about-more-than-life-hacks), each of which is equally important:
> 
> - **Awareness** that your available time is limited—the matrix doesn’t measure the accuracy of your time estimates for tasks, nor does it improve how you allocate your limited time.
>     
> - **Arrangement** of your time through goal-setting, planning, and scheduling—the matrix is most effective in this category because it helps you prioritize the most important tasks to schedule accordingly.
>     
> - **Adaptation** of your time while carrying out tasks, particularly when you’re interrupted and have to shift priorities—the matrix potentially improves adaptation by providing a system to gauge priorities on the fly if your work is interrupted with an urgent request.
>     

#### How To

Covey asserts that **weekly planning is the most effective way to manage your time and achieve your goals**: A weekly schedule is narrow enough to ensure important tasks get done promptly, and it’s broad enough to be flexible when things come up unexpectedly.

Follow these steps to create your weekly plan:

1. Identify your roles (such as employee or volunteer).
2. Identify one or two goals you want to achieve for each role in the next week.
3. Assign a day to accomplish each goal.
4. Schedule time for activities that renew and revitalize you. (More on this in Habit 7.)
5. Build in open, unscheduled time for the unexpected.
6. When things come up unexpectedly, evaluate how they fit your goals and schedule.

> **Prioritize and Get Things Done**
> 
> Habit 3 takes a big-picture approach to time management, but the _[Getting Things Done](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/1-page-summary)_ (GTD) system offers more specific advice on how to gather, assess, organize, and address the relentless flow of emails and demands. The five steps of the GTD system are:
> 
> - **[Capture](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-5)** every problem, idea, reminder, and to-do in a designated in-tray.
>     
> - **[Clarify](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-6)** what you need to do with each item: throw it away, keep it for reference, delegate it, do it, schedule it, or save it to reconsider later.
>     
> - **[Organize](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-7)** each item: File reference items and things to reconsider, hand off delegated items, write action items on a to-do list, and put scheduled items on a calendar.
>     
> - **[Review](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-8)** your calendar and to-do list frequently; your calendar determines the structure of your days and weeks, while your to-do list tells you what to tackle between scheduled appointments.
>     
> - **[Engage](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-9)** with the task; in other words, get it done.
>     
> 
> Rather than creating a weekly _schedule_, as Covey recommends, the GTD system emphasizes a weekly _review_ to update to-do lists and calendars and review scheduled appointments and priorities for the week ahead.

### Habit 4: Seek Mutual Benefits

#### Habit Description

When tackling a problem or negotiation with someone, always strive to find a mutually beneficial solution.

#### Why It Matters

While Habits 1-3 focus on personal effectiveness, Covey says that Habits 4-6 focus on building interdependent (or collaborative) success through strong relationships and effective interactions.

Habit 4 is the first step: Approach every interaction as an opportunity to find a mutually beneficial outcome, which Covey calls a “Win/Win” mindset.

- Description: This mindset values cooperation over competition—one person’s success doesn’t come at the expense of another’s.
- Benefits: It strengthens the relationship between the people involved—improving the quality of future collaborations—and leads to more innovative solutions.

(Shortform note: Although the idea of finding a mutually beneficial solution seems appealing, negotiation coach Jim Camp argues that win/win often [pressures both parties to rush to any agreement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcamp/2013/03/11/revisiting-win-win-negotiation-its-still-a-losing-game/?sh=48760bc942b6) rather than doing the haggling necessary to reach the _best_ deal.)

#### How To

Once you’ve adopted the right mindset and you sit down to negotiate or work together, how do you actually arrive at a mutually beneficial solution? Covey offers these tips:

1. Try to understand the other person’s perspective. We’ll explain how to do this in Habit 5. (Shortform note: Rather than simply _understanding_ it, _[Never Split the Difference](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/never-split-the-difference-chris-vosstahl-raz?variant=32117745385506)_ author Chris Voss promotes _[changing the other person’s perspective](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/never-split-the-difference/chapter-6)_ in your favor.)
2. Describe each person’s biggest concerns as objectively as possible. (Shortform note: Voss suggests a [“calculated empathy”](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/never-split-the-difference/chapters-1-3) tactic in which you [name the other person’s feelings](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/never-split-the-difference/chapters-1-3) to increase trust and rapport for the purpose of getting what you want.)
3. Identify what results constitute a “win” for each person. (Shortform note: Voss says [desires and fears often distract people](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/never-split-the-difference/chapters-1-3) from what they really want in negotiations.)
4. Determine a new solution that achieves those results. (Shortform note: _[Getting to Yes](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/324551/getting-to-yes-by-roger-fisher-and-william-ury/)_ authors Roger Fisher and William Ury [suggest using objective criteria](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-to-yes/element-4)—like market values—to measure how a solution benefits each side.)

### Habit 5: Listen and Understand the Other First

#### Habit Description

When communicating with others, Covey urges you to try to understand _their_ perspective before asking them to understand _yours_.

#### Why It Matters

Covey points out that you can’t reach a _mutually_ beneficial solution without first understanding the other person’s interests. This requires empathic listening, or striving to understand the other person’s perspectives by interpreting what they’re saying as well as how they feel. (Shortform note: Subsequent research has found that, beyond empathy, [effective listening involves giving supportive, constructive responses](https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do).)

#### How To

Covey suggests you practice empathic listening with these exercises:

- **People-watch to practice interpreting nonverbal cues.** Observe an interaction from afar. What can you discern about people’s emotions based solely on their body language?
- **Practice switching views.** In a debate or negotiation, try to describe the situation from the other person’s perspective. Then, explain _your_ point through _their_ lens.
- **Ask a friend or family member for feedback.** Explain the concept of empathic listening, and ask them to tell you in a week how well you listened empathically to them.

> **Specific Strategies for Empathic Listening**
> 
> Covey’s exercises allow you to practice empathic listening, but he doesn’t provide many specific strategies. Supplement Covey’s exercises with these [practical strategies for empathic listening](https://www.crisisprevention.com/Blog/7-Tips-for-Empathic-Listening) from the Crisis Prevention Center:
> 
> - **Signal that you're listening** with your body language and gestures like nodding.
>     
> - **Withhold your judgments.** You don’t have to _agree_ with the other person, but you must release your opinions long enough to understand the other person’s perspective.
>     
> - **Paraphrase what you think the other person is saying**, and ask them if you’re correct.
>     
> - **Embrace silence.** Sometimes your presence is enough to make the other person feel supported.
>     
> - **Don’t cut the conversation short.** Make sure the other person has expressed everything they wanted to say.
>     

### Habit 6: Collaborate to Create Possibilities

#### Habit Description

Covey contends that collaborating (creating what he calls “synergy”) with another person enables you to achieve more than either of you could alone.

#### Why It Matters

Covey believes that collaboration creates outcomes greater than the sum of the parts, as in 1+1 = 3 or more (for example, one singer plus another singer creates a harmony). This is possible because the relationship itself adds value by creating the opportunity for collaboration.

The mutually beneficial mindset from Habit 4 and empathic listening from Habit 5 foster trust and goodwill, which are necessary for effective communication and collaboration. Covey suggests that the collaborative process then strengthens the relationship, which benefits future collaborations. (Shortform note: Subsequent research has revealed that the connection between empathy, trust, and [collaboration is neurological](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust): When people feel trusted, their brains release higher levels of oxytocin, which makes them more _trustworthy_ and _trusting_. As a result, in high-trust environments, people become more productive and collaborative.)

#### How To

To effectively collaborate, Covey says you need “internal synergy.” In other words, be both analytical and intuitive, because life can be logical as well as emotional.

(Shortform note: To supplement Covey’s advice, which is fairly abstract, managers can use specific strategies to [increase trust and promote collaboration on their teams](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust). These tactics include encouraging relationship-building among teammates, giving people the freedom to choose how they work, and celebrating successes publicly and promptly.)

### Habit 7: Practice Self-Renewal

#### Habit Description

Covey’s final habit, self-renewal, maintains your well-being so that you can continue doing the work of Habits 1-6.

#### Why It Matters

Covey asserts that keeping yourself mentally and physically healthy prevents burnout, supports productivity, and actually improves your overall efficiency and effectiveness, creating an upward spiral of growth. Self-renewal also helps you stay disciplined and focused on your goals and values.

(Shortform note: A key benefit that Covey overlooks is that self-renewal [weakens the negative impacts of stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080382/). This reframes the value of self-care: It doesn’t make you feel better by masking or distracting from your issues, but rather by helping you get through them.)

#### How To

Covey advises practicing four aspects of self-renewal:

1. Physical—Eat well, exercise, and get enough sleep and relaxation.
2. Spiritual—This can include praying, meditating, reading, and spending time in nature.
3. Mental—Read, write, and expose yourself to new information.
4. Social/emotional—Since emotional health is so closely tied with social interactions, Covey argues that this form of self-renewal actually comes from practicing Habits 4-6.

> **Focus on What’s Most Important**
> 
> Minimalists have developed similar categories, not for the express purpose of self-renewal, but rather as a way to focus on the most important things in order to eliminate excess and live a simpler life. However, decluttering your life in these areas could also contribute to self-renewal. _[Minimalism](https://asymmetrical.co/books/minimalism-live-a-meaningful-life/)_ authors Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus describe five key values (some of which overlap Covey’s four dimensions):
> 
> - [Health](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-2)—Eat well and exercise.
>     
> - [Relationships](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-3)—Drop unproductive relationships and invest in meaningful ones.
>     
> - [Passions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-4)—Pursue a mission-driven passion instead of career and status.
>     
> - [Growth](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-5)—Make small, daily changes that contribute to substantial growth over time.
>     
> - [Contribute to others](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-6)—Serve society and help others grow.
>
