## Part 2: Dalio’s Principles | Chapter 4: Relentless Truth-Seeking

In Part 2, we’ll cover Dalio’s main principles and how you can use them to better deal with struggle and make better decisions in both life and work. We’ll start with one of the strongest themes of the book: **understanding the importance of finding the truth.**

After his emotions and overconfidence led to disastrous mistakes, Dalio learned that he made the best decisions when he put his ego aside and relentlessly sought the truth. In this chapter, we’ll explore how to overcome the barriers to recognizing the truth.

### Embrace Reality

When you’re struggling, Dalio says you shouldn’t fall into the trap of wishing that reality were different or how things “should” be. This will bias your objectivity and get you nowhere. Instead, embrace your reality and deal with it. You must be **totally receptive to the possibility that you are wrong**.

If you think something is morally wrong, Dalio says to assume that _you’re_ wrong and figure out why what nature is doing makes sense. Nature optimizes for the whole, but people narrowly judge good and bad based on how it affects the individual. For example, a pack of hyenas killing a young wildebeest feels wrong, but on reflection, it’s clear this is good for the evolution of the wildebeest and for the total system.

(Shortform note: Dalio believes that everything adheres to nature’s laws, including social and financial systems. However, some people would argue that the laws that apply to animals do not necessarily apply to humans. For example, philosopher Karl Marx posits that [humans operate on a level called “species-being.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_human_nature) At this level, humans are conscious of what they do and why—we don’t operate on the animalistic level of instinct, but on reflexivity, values, principles, and conscience.)

### The Two Hurdles to Recognizing Reality

Dalio says that when it comes to assessing a situation, you should always assume that something is missing. Even the safest-looking bets have risks, so **instead of declaring “I’m right,” ask, “How do I know I’m right?”**

(Shortform note: Questioning what you know, as Dalio suggests, helps you arrive at the truth. However, in the process of filling in the gaps of your knowledge, [take care not to fall into two traps](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/part-4), as described in _[21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century)_: The first trap is the **knowledge illusion**, or mistaking group knowledge for individual wisdom and being unaware of your own ignorance. The second trap is **groupthink**, or surrounding yourself with people who echo views that may be flawed.)

Dalio warns that there are two things that often get in the way of seeing reality: **your ego and your blind spots.**

#### Hurdle #1: Your Ego

Dalio writes that there are two “yous”: a high-level rational, conscious you, and a lower-level emotional, often subconscious you.

The lower level is where your ego hurdle resides. Your ego is your underlying desire to be capable, to be seen by other people as capable, to be loved, to feel important, and to be praised by others. Experiences that threaten that ego—those that make you feel irrelevant or that point out your weaknesses—are painful. To avoid this pain, you might shut yourself off from self-reflection or deny reality.

To protect yourself from the pain of a bruised ego, the subconscious you hijacks your brain and actions, so you end up reacting spontaneously and emotionally without thinking.

(Shortform note: Allowing your ego to take over can harm you in more ways than the one Dalio describes. In _[Ego Is the Enemy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy)_, author Ryan Holiday mentions [three ways that ego can keep you from being successful](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy): First, it can lead you to brag and self-promote instead of taking action. Second, it can make you feel like you know everything, which prevents you from growing. And third, it can make it especially difficult for you to recover from failure.)

Dalio outlines three ways you can prevent your ego from taking over and holding you back from success:

##### 1) Recognize the Warning Signs

Dalio says you should pay attention to the signals your body is sending you, such as your chest tightening, your blood pressure rising, or your heart rate increasing. This means that your emotional self is taking over. Train yourself to get out of this hijacked state, so the rational you can gain control.

(Shortform note: In training yourself to get out of this hijacked state, it helps to recognize the three emotions that people find most difficult to regulate: anger, anxiety, and sadness. In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence)_, author Daniel Goleman says you can [manage these emotions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2) by using relaxation techniques like deep breathing and by scheduling pleasant distractions like watching TV or listening to music.)

##### 2) Reflect On and Savor the Pain, Instead of Avoiding It

Dalio says that pain is a necessary part of getting stronger. He sums it up in his equation: **Pain + Reflection = Progress**. He says that when you make a mistake, take full responsibility for it and relish the chance to get better, rather than being ashamed about it.

Dalio notes that plenty of people at Bridgewater make very costly mistakes. A common corporate reaction is to fire these people, but Dalio thinks this just encourages people to hide their mistakes. Instead, he says that reflecting on mistakes as a team and striving to do better is the best way forward, so Bridgewater has an “issue log” where employees must add each of their mistakes.

> **Different Formula, Similar Principle**
> 
> Dalio uses the equation of Pain + Reflection = Progress to show how you can use your mistakes to get a better outcome in the future. In _[The Success Principles](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles)_, author Jack Canfield offers [a similar formula for improving outcomes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principles-1-30): **Event + Response = Outcome**:
> 
> - **Event:** something that happens in your life
>     
> - **Response:** how you choose to respond to the event
>     
> - **Outcome:** the _result_ of how you choose to respond to the event
>     
> 
> According to Canfield, there are two possible responses. You can either **blame the event for your outcome**, or you can **adjust your response until you get your desired outcome**. The latter is the best course of action because it means you take responsibility for the quality of your life and believe that it’s within your power to improve it. Both formulas—Dalio’s and Canfield’s—require you to accept _your_ role in your situation instead of blaming outside forces.

##### 3) See Self-Improvement as Its Own Reward

You may think that striving to get better by embracing your mistakes is for the sake of material rewards, like more money or a bigger house. But Dalio notes that beyond the basics like shelter, relationships, and food, the benefit of the marginal improvement from material gains drops off quickly.

(Shortform note: Some [research refutes the idea that happiness plateaus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2021/02/07/new-study-shows-that-more-money-buys-more-happiness/?sh=73d072e70d56) after a certain income level—many people _do_ report that their happiness consistently increases alongside their income. However, this doesn’t mean that people with lower incomes can’t be happy, or that wealthy people can’t be unhappy. Experts say that happiness is _multifaceted_, and you can [increase your feelings of well-being](https://www.verywellmind.com/happiness-doesn-t-top-out-at-usd75-000-study-says-5097098) by putting more joyful effort into everyday tasks and forging connections with other people.)

**The real prize that gives you the _most_ satisfaction is getting better and stronger from the struggle**. Evolving and improving helps you ascend to higher and higher levels, allowing you to tackle bigger challenges. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple.

Because the struggle for self-improvement is so fulfilling, Dalio says you shouldn’t deprive other people of their chance to struggle. Deny them what they want to give them the opportunity to struggle, which will lead to strength.

(Shortform note: Dalio cites Carl Jung, saying that it’s a natural law that you have to push your limits and experience pain to become stronger. The _[Current Affairs](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/how-to-make-everyone-in-your-vicinity-secretly-fear-and-despise-you)_ review challenges this struggle-centric outlook, arguing that it’s a law better applied to muscular development and that it’s possible to [make progress without experiencing much pain](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/how-to-make-everyone-in-your-vicinity-secretly-fear-and-despise-you).)

##### Reconcile the Two Yous

Dalio argues that the best ideas and decisions may come from the cooperation of the two yous, not when the rational you completely subjugates the subconscious you. For example, sometimes the greatest inspiration “pops up” from our subconscious. This happens most often when you’re relaxed and not consciously forcing yourself to come up with great ideas. The conscious logical mind then examines the ideas for how good they are.

(Shortform note: You can see the power of your subconscious mind in action when you dream. In _[Why We Sleep](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/why-we-sleep)_, author Matthew Walker writes that in the [dream stage of sleep, when you’re fully relaxed, you create novel connections](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/why-we-sleep/part-3) between ideas, which increases creativity and problem-solving ability and leads to a higher-level comprehension of ideas.)

Dalio personally likes transcendental meditation to connect the conscious to the subconscious. He says that meditation creates an equanimity that allows clearer and more creative thinking.

(Shortform note: Aside from creative thinking, you can also use meditation to [understand your biases and fears](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/chapter-21). Understanding your own mind in this way can help you make better sense of the world and lead you to act more wisely and effectively.)

Reconciling the two yous isn’t just something you do on a personal level. It’s also something you have to consider when talking to someone else, because you’re dealing with _their_ two yous. You can be engaged in one of four conversations, without realizing which one you’re in: Your subconscious you might be talking to the other person’s rational you, or vice versa; or both of your subconscious emotional yous are battling with each other. This leads to misunderstandings and arguments.

(Shortform note: [Navigating the conversation between the two emotional yous](https://www.shortform.com/app/article/an-adults-guide-to-social-skills-for-those-who-were-never-taught-eric-ravenscraft-the-new-york-times) effectively requires you to recognize and manage your emotions as well as the other person’s emotions. This means understanding how your emotions affect you, knowing how to calm down when an emotional response surfaces, and being aware of the triggers of the other person’s response.)

#### Hurdle #2: Your Blind Spots

In addition to overcoming your ego hurdle, Dalio says you need to overcome your blind spot hurdle. Your blind spots materialize when you see the world through your own biased lens. You can’t appreciate what you can’t see, any more than a color-blind person can know what color is. Thus, Dalio explains, two people who see the world very differently often end up arguing over who’s right without understanding their own blind spots.

- For example, some people only see big pictures and miss small details, while others are the opposite. As a result, they might waste time arguing about the right direction for a project instead of coming together to see the full picture.

(Shortform note: Leaders are especially prone to having blind spots. In _[Creativity, Inc.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc)_, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull says [this is due to three factors](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-4): First, employees want to look competent in front of their bosses, so they aren’t honest about issues. Second, a middle manager might make it challenging to report any mistreatment. And third, the size of some organizations makes it difficult to get all perspectives.)

**The solution to both the ego hurdle and the blind spot hurdle is total receptivity** (what Dalio calls “radical open-mindedness”), which we’ll discuss in the next chapter.
