## Part 3: The External Fight | Do What It Takes to Succeed

In Part 2, we began discussing specific strategies to help you accomplish your life goals and transform the obstacles impeding these goals into opportunities that move you forward. This first set of strategies had to do with internal, emotional discipline—intentionally shaping your own emotional state to push yourself toward virtuous action and withstand potentially demoralizing setbacks.

Now, in Part 3, we’ll conclude our discussion of strategies to help you achieve your life goals with a set of strategies to overcome obstacles in the _external world_. Holiday refers to these strategies as “The Discipline of Action,” difficult yet rewarding paths to success that require you to transform obstacles into gifts at every turn.

(Shortform note: Whereas Holiday frames the “Discipline of Action” as the ability to do whatever it takes to get what you want, the original Stoic Discipline of Action as laid out in [Epictetus’s Discourses](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304102/discourses-and-selected-writings-by-epictetus/) is synonymous with a _life of virtue_. This distinction stems from the Stoic belief that instead of chasing your desires and goals, _[virtuous action, based on rational feelings of love for all mankind, is the path to fulfillment](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/20/introduction-to-stoicism-the-three-disciplines/)_—an idea Holiday acknowledges in this book, but doesn’t dwell on.)

These strategies for external success include:

- Act, don’t think.
- Learn something from every failure.
- Set unreasonable goals.
- Predict what will go wrong.
- Embrace unconventional paths to success.

Let’s take a look at each of these new strategies:

### Strategy #1: Act, Don’t Think

The core of Holiday’s overall strategy for success is to **start immediately and rush toward your goal as quickly and aggressively as possible**. When faced with the need for action, we too often procrastinate and make excuses. On a good day, we may analyze the problem and even map out solutions, but in the end, we don’t do anything, paralyzed by uncertainty. In doing so, we ignore the fact that **people succeed because they act frequently and consistently, not because they act perfectly**.

Consistently putting in effort is how you build the momentum necessary to reach your goals, and momentum is more important than anything else. Take big leaps toward your goals, even if they’re risky. Holiday emphasizes the danger of stagnation—if you ever stop aggressively moving forward with as much effort as you can muster, you risk becoming soft and complacent.

Holiday states that when we take our time analyzing an obstacle, we tend to obsess over what it means to us instead of simply seeing it as it is. This makes obstacles seem bigger and more difficult to deal with than they truly are. **Instead of overanalyzing what problems mean, take the first step toward solving them.** For example, if you lose your job, you may get caught up in painful navel-gazing, trying to pinpoint everything you did wrong and fretting about what’ll happen to you in the future. Instead, Holiday would advise you to force yourself to live in the present and start looking for another job.

> **The One Thing You _Should_ Think About**
> 
> In _[The One Thing](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing)_, Gary Keller, like Holiday, acknowledges the importance of consistent action to build momentum toward your goals over time. However, Keller [emphasizes that this momentum must be focused in the right place for it to be worth your time](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing/chapter-1). Holiday warns of the dangers of overthinking, but Keller would argue that if you act without first considering how to optimize your effort, underthinking can be just as harmful.
> 
> Keller argues that even if you’re aggressively taking action toward your goal, you’re wasting your time if you’re not focusing on your “One Thing”—the task that will get you to your most ambitious goal faster than anything else. To find your One Thing, Keller suggests asking yourself [“What one thing can I focus on that will have the greatest impact on my overall goal?”](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing/part-2-chapters-10-12) For example, if you want to start a restaurant, your One Thing may be to perfect your signature dish—this will make it easier for you to advertise, win over investors, and retain loyal customers in the future.
> 
> Another reason to take the time to determine your One Thing is the psychological advantage this provides. Holiday warns that taking too much time analyzing your problem and what it means for you will make it seem more difficult to complete than it actually is. However, if you follow Keller’s advice, analyzing your problems may actually make them _less_ intimidating, as the goal is to identify tasks and obstacles you can ignore completely. In Keller’s eyes, you have to do far less to succeed than people generally imagine. Paring your big goal down to the most essential task will give you the confidence to take action.

#### When Tragedy Strikes, Act

Holiday asserts that in many cases, aggressive action is most effective in times when we’d least want to act: after an unexpected disaster sweeps us off our feet. When tragedy strikes, most people recoil, taking fewer risks and seeking to conserve whatever they have left. However, we would be better off keeping our eyes open for an opportunity within the tragedy, as the harshest tragedies sometimes carry the greatest gifts.

Tragedies take something from us that we would have wanted to keep or otherwise shake us out of our comfort zone. However, Holiday points out that **by changing our circumstances so drastically, they inevitably reveal new choices** we wouldn’t have been able to make before the crisis. To use an extreme example, if you’re the victim of identity theft and lose your life savings, the event may spur you to pursue your dream of selling your belongings and joining a monastery.

Furthermore, Holiday cites a psychological phenomenon called post-traumatic growth—evidence shows that people who persevere through pain and suffering are often positively transformed by the experience. They recognize their own strength and become more motivated to accomplish meaningful tasks. You can claim benefits like these by continuing to act in the face of tragedy.

> **Why You Need Some Adversity**
> 
> In _[The Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis)_, Jonathan Haidt [devotes a chapter to the benefits of tragedy and examines the phenomenon of post-traumatic growth](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/chapter-6). Haidt goes into greater detail than Holiday about how enduring tragedy helps you develop a resilient character, and he even makes the case that some hardship is necessary for humans to reach their full potential.
> 
> Haidt notes that trauma not only exposes survivors to new, often better opportunities (as Holiday establishes), but it also changes, and often improves, the values and priorities they use to evaluate those opportunities. When ripped from their comfort zones, trauma survivors realize that the things they used to find important—their career or material comforts—no longer matter to them. They spend time exploring alternative sources of happiness (for instance, loving relationships) and often settle on more reliable and sustainable sources of happiness than those they previously held.
> 
> Additionally, Haidt explains that adversity serves as valuable material for the narrative you tell yourself about your life. If, thinking back, your life story serves as proof that you’re the kind of person who overcomes adversity for a noble cause, you’ll be more resilient and purposeful in the present. For this reason, a certain amount of adversity is healthy, especially in your late teens and early adulthood, when your self-narrative is first solidifying.

### Strategy #2: Learn Something From Every Failure

Holiday acknowledges that if you follow his advice to act aggressively and persistently, you’ll inevitably fail often. However, he sees this as an unequivocally good thing. **Trial and error is the most effective way to learn anything**. Every failure teaches you how not to do something and forces you to come up with ideas you wouldn’t have normally thought of.

We’ve all heard stories of people learning valuable lessons from failure. We know that it’s a necessary part of the path to success. Yet most of us will do anything we can to avoid failure—it’s embarrassing and painful. Arguing against this attitude, Holiday points out that **trial and error hurts much less than a life in which you’ve stopped learning**. Prideful people who refuse to learn from their mistakes doom themselves to repeat the same misguided actions indefinitely.

It’s in your best interest to fail as soon as possible, to catch obvious mistakes before investing hundreds of hours into something destined to fail. Thus, Holiday recommends you **take small, frequent risks when working toward your goals.** The sooner you can expose your work to external feedback (and potential failure), the better. With every failure, investigate what went wrong and why. Then change something and try again, repeating this cycle as often as you can.

> **How Thinking in Bets Helps You Learn**
> 
> In _[Thinking in Bets](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-bets)_, professional poker player Annie Duke [dispenses advice on strategic decision-making in uncertain circumstances](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-bets/chapter-1). Like Holiday, Duke views trial and error as the most valuable learning tool available to us, and she offers specific tips on how to get the most value out of our mistakes.
> 
> Duke’s thesis is that **we should view every belief we hold and decision we make as a _bet_**—a gamble based on the idea that something _might_ be true. Thinking in bets is helpful for two reasons: First, it forces us to acknowledge that there is always a chance we could be wrong. Instead of seeing our beliefs as either true or false, we place them on a spectrum _between_ true and false, making us more likely to adjust them after negative outcomes.
> 
> Second, thinking in bets helps us recognize that every decision we make requires risk and potential sacrifice. Just as we lose money on a failed bet, every misguided decision we make leads us to a worse future than we could have had. For both of these reasons, imagining our beliefs and decisions as bets helps us avoid repeating the same mistakes—which, as Holiday points out, is far more painful than learning from trial and error.
> 
> Additionally, thinking in bets naturally encourages us to take small risks for frequent external feedback, as Holiday advises, since it prompts us to consider the possibility that long-term unquestioned beliefs may lead to a massive loss. For example, imagine you’re managing a PR team in charge of your company’s rebranding. If you have faith in your team, you may be tempted to invest hundreds of hours in a full redesign that will sweep your boss off their feet. If you were to think in bets, however, you would recognize that this is a costly gamble with a non-zero chance your boss won’t like it. A smaller, safer bet would be to run several design mockups by your boss, seeking feedback before investing too much time and money in the project.

### Strategy #3: Set Unreasonable Goals

Holiday asserts that people who habitually fear failure—that is, almost everyone—generally assume that they can accomplish far less than they actually can. To avoid this mistake, he advises you to confidently set unreasonably ambitious goals and attempt to do the impossible.

As we’ve established, the only way for a problem to be impossible to solve is for you to believe that it is. Holiday insists that the reverse is also true: In a sense, **believing that something is possible allows you to bend widely accepted “facts” of reality.** This is something that all of history’s groundbreaking artists, inventors, and activists have done—if no one attempted to do the “impossible,” the human race would never make progress. You can contribute to humanity on an unimaginably grand scale.

To Holiday, another benefit of setting your ambitions unrealistically high is that you’re raising the stakes: You’ll look like a genius if you succeed and a fool for trying if you fail. He advises you to seek out high-pressure situations like this because they’re most likely to inspire your best work. By focusing on the energizing effect of a big risk, you can transform it from something terrifying into something exciting.

> **Multiply Your Goals by Ten**
> 
> In _[The 10X Rule](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule)_, Grant Cardone makes the same argument as Holiday: Setting goals that seem unrealistic is the key to success. Specifically, Cardone [lays out the “10X Rule”](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/chapter-1)—you should set goals ten times bigger than what you think you should achieve, and expect to put in ten times as much effort as you imagine is necessary.
> 
> Counterintuitively, Cardone [argues that most people fail because they don’t set difficult enough goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/chapter-9). How can this be? Most people set average, realistic goals and underestimate the effort it takes to achieve them. When it becomes obvious how much work these goals actually require, they aren’t excited enough to push through the unexpected struggle, so they quit.
> 
> Like Holiday, Cardone emphasizes that enormous goals have tremendous motivating power. Accomplishing something that seems impossible—getting your name in the history books, so to speak—is a dream that will make you _want_ to put in ten times the effort you normally would. Consequently, Cardone asserts that the way to get anything you want is to frequently reflect on your “10X goals”: Write them down twice a day, phrasing them as if you’ve already accomplished them to immerse yourself in what it will feel like to succeed.

### Strategy #4: Predict What Will Go Wrong

Holiday argues that it’s important to remember that eventually, things will go wrong. People will let you down and random disasters will strike—this is the only constant in our unpredictable world. Your only defense is to anticipate what could go wrong and prevent or prepare for it. Holiday recommends making this a core step of your routine: **Before taking any action, think up contingency plans for everything you can imagine going wrong.**

It’s unpleasant to think about all the bad things that could happen, and consequently, too few people do it. However, Holiday asserts that this delusional optimism results in countless disasters that could have easily been prevented with a little foresight—disasters with consequences that are ultimately much more painful than thinking negatively ahead of time.

Additionally, Holiday points out that when you refuse to consider negative outcomes, not only do you suffer fully avoidable consequences, **but** **you also create a greater divide between your expectations and the world’s harsh reality.** Inevitable setbacks are even more painful when you deny the possibility that they could happen. The world seems disproportionately unfair.

Stoics, on the other hand, refuse to shy away from reality. Holiday asserts that if we think Stoically, viewing all events as neither good nor bad, we have no reason to fear misfortune and can analyze it head-on. This is beneficial: Mentally preparing for adversity not only ensures that you’ll respond wisely and appropriately when the time comes, but it also means you won’t be upset since everything is happening just as you expected.

> **You Shouldn’t Try to Predict Everything**
> 
> In _The Dichotomy of Leadership_, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin argue that while planning for what could go wrong (as Holiday suggests) helps avert painful disasters, _[overplanning—attempting to prepare a detailed response for every possible setback—can be harmful](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-dichotomy-of-leadership/1-page-summary#when-in-doubt-do-something)_.
> 
> Trying to predict everything that could go wrong will severely slow you down, and it may even halt your progress entirely. At a certain point, this wasted time becomes more costly than it’s worth. Additionally, overpreparing for unlikely events often causes its own problems. For example, Babin, a commander in the Navy SEALs, learned that assigning more soldiers than necessary to a task endangered the mission, as the team became more difficult to manage with size.
> 
> For these reasons, Willink and Babin recommend limiting yourself to three or four contingency plans for the most likely things to go wrong, as well as a plan for your worst-case scenario.

> **Is It Bad to Be an Optimist?**
> 
> Holiday makes the case that if you think optimistically, refusing to expect negative outcomes, life’s inevitable disappointments and frustrations will be even more painful. Recent research backs up this argument: One study of 1,601 British citizens found that optimists who predicted they would make more money in the next year than they really did [reported lower well-being and greater emotional distress](https://theconversation.com/why-realism-is-the-key-to-wellbeing-new-research-139717) than realists who were able to accurately forecast how much money they would earn.
> 
> However, the same study showed that excessive pessimism—predicting things will be worse than they really are—reduces well-being even more than optimism. The researchers suspect that constantly expecting the worst keeps pessimists unhappy, even when things turn out better than they hoped. This conclusion implies that Holiday is right to promote the Stoic practice of seeing events neutrally. Ideally, you would be able to anticipate misfortune without allowing it to dampen your spirits.

### Strategy #5: Embrace Unconventional Paths to Success

Finally, Holiday advises keeping an open mind when formulating ways to achieve your goals. We often get stuck because we assume that there’s only one way to get what we want. In reality, **there are an infinite number of ways to achieve success**—they’re just less obvious than the first idea that comes to mind. Instead of waiting until the perfect conditions for the ideal strategy to succeed, use whatever strategy allows you to immediately move forward.

> **Unconventional Paths to a Life Purpose**
> 
> We can apply this logic not only to specific short-term goals but also to your _overarching life purpose_. According to David Epstein in _[Range](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/range)_, many people assume that to achieve the highest level of success, you need to set a long-term goal years in advance and commit to reaching it no matter what. In reality, [there are an infinite number of meandering ways to become a top performer without planning to do so](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/range/part-2-3).
> 
> One Harvard study found that, out of 50 high-level professionals from a variety of fields, 45 had followed an unconventional path to their position, believing that they were the exception to the rule. Stumbling into success isn’t an anomaly—it’s the norm. By only planning in the short term, moving forward in whatever area appeals to you at the time, you can find more success than if you limit yourself to a single predetermined life path.

According to Holiday, if your current strategy is failing, you can try:

- Doing what others least expect you to do
- Bending or breaking the accepted rules
- Doing nothing, allowing the problem to conquer itself

Let’s discuss each of these unconventional tactics:

#### Unconventional Tactic #1: Do Something Unexpected

**In many cases, the most successful strategy is that which is _least expected_**. Holiday explains that the conventional strategy—the one other people in your situation use the most often—frequently has the lowest chance of success, as it’s the strategy your enemies and obstacles are the most prepared for. Using an obscure strategy to reach your goal often allows you to succeed with far less effort.

For example, if you’re trying to get your novel published, instead of sending query letters to agents or publishers and burying your pitch among thousands of others, find an unconventional way to make connections in the industry—for instance, locate a nearby writers’ conference to network at and volunteer to help run it.

When you’re working with far fewer resources than the situation seems to require (or fewer resources than your competitors have), Holiday argues that an unexpected strategy becomes a necessity. This is one of the hidden benefits of what seem to be entirely detrimental limitations—by forcing you to find effective paths to success, your constraints become unique strengths.

> **Acting Unpredictably Disorients Your Opponents**
> 
> In _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)_, Holiday’s mentor Robert Greene argues that even if your unexpected strategy isn’t successful in itself, acting unpredictably is valuable because [it’s one of the most intimidating strategic moves possible](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power/law-17). Doing something unpredictable, even irrational, forces any opponents you have to consider that they may be missing something. This paranoia and confusion often cause them to make mistakes.
> 
> Greene asserts that even if you lack direct competitors to intimidate, acting unpredictably has other benefits. When no one understands why you’re doing something, you create an air of intrigue, attracting the attention of potential supporters. You may even earn their respect as people ascribe sophisticated motives to your actions that you never had.
> 
> Unlike Holiday, who emphasizes the necessity for underdogs with few resources to do what’s unexpected, Greene states that unpredictability is most powerful for established successes. Once you’ve already proven yourself to be competent, observers are more likely to assume that everything you do is deliberately calculated.

#### Unconventional Tactic #2: Break the Rules

Second, Holiday asserts that sometimes, you’ll need to bend or break the rules to get what you want. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Push the boundaries, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Holiday states that if you’re honestly pursuing your ideals, a little dishonesty in the name of the greater good is fully justified. Once you’ve found a mission that’s important and virtuous enough for you to devote your life to it, as we’ve established Holiday wants you to do, the only thing that matters is that you get it done. He points out that you’ll have a devastating advantage over your competitors who _are_ following the rules.

> **When Is It Right to Break the Rules?**
> 
> How do you know when bending or breaking the rules is the right thing to do? The answer to this question will vary depending on your personal values, but here’s one guiding principle: [When you bend the rules, you need to be aware of what you’re sacrificing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-adaptive-mind/201812/when-breaking-the-rules-is-the-smart-thing-do). Most constraints exist for a reason, and breaking them may have unexpected consequences.
> 
> For example, Pablo Picasso mastered the rules of traditional painting—perspective, light, and shadow—before throwing them out the window. He knew the exact effect that these techniques gave his paintings, which allowed him to intentionally achieve a specific groundbreaking effect by sacrificing them in his cubist work.

#### Unconventional Tactic #3: Do Nothing

Lastly, in some cases, the best way to get results is to do _nothing_—especially if action isn’t getting you anywhere and is causing you to struggle through a tough situation. According to Holiday, in many situations, the harder you struggle, the worse your problems get. It’s easy to get overeager, spring into action, and end up hurting yourself. For example, a programmer who downs energy drinks to code through the night will get sloppy, leaving bugs that take a great deal of time to resolve. If they’d remained inactive, resting for a while before jumping into the project, things would likely have gone more smoothly.

At first, this push toward inaction seems to contradict Holiday’s advice to relentlessly take action and move forward. However, he clarifies that **inaction can be a form of action** when it’s the most effective way to move forward.

Holiday explains that to determine whether inaction is the right thing to do, be aware of how much you’re progressing toward your goals. As we’ve previously established, stagnation is one of the most common pitfalls on the way to success. With this in mind, it’s best not to jump to the conclusion that inaction is the right move if your progress thus far has been slow and you’re at risk of stagnating. But if your intense efforts to make an obstacle budge aren’t working, it’s possible you’re pushing forward too aggressively and even temporary inaction would benefit you.

It’s worth noting that if you’re passionate about a goal, doing nothing can feel more difficult than taking action. The same drive that pushes you toward your goal may itself become an obstacle, urging you into a situation you would be better off avoiding. Holiday points out that this kind of self-control requires humility—you have to admit to yourself that tackling the problem in a straightforward way isn’t working for you. After you back away from the obstacle, a new way forward is likely to reveal itself.

> **Iatrogenics: When It’s Better to Do Nothing**
> 
> In _[Antifragile](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/antifragile)_, Nassim Nicholas Taleb discusses this topic at length, [arguing that harmful, unnecessary action causes far more problems than we imagine](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/antifragile/chapters-6-7), in many areas of human life. This is called _iatrogenics_, translated as “caused by the healer”—cases in which well-intentioned intervention ends up hurting more than helping. Taleb asserts that in these situations, doing nothing would be a more constructive and moral way to move forward.
> 
> For example, Taleb argues in his book _[Skin in the Game](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/skin-in-the-game/chapter-10)_ that foreign intervention in distant wars inevitably prolongs the conflict and violence. He makes the case that the infamous Israeli-Palestinian conflict would have been resolved decades ago if organizations like the United Nations and the Arab League had simply chosen to do nothing. Consequently, he’s sharply critical of interventionist leaders, accusing them of lacking the humility that Holiday maintains is necessary to pursue inaction.
> 
> Holiday states that it’s important to keep tabs on whether you’re making progress toward your goal to determine whether inaction is ideal. However, Taleb points out that in environments where iatrogenics run rampant, the damage is difficult to see. Because we can’t clearly link harmful effects to their causes—such as war in the Middle East to foreign policy—harmful intervention continues.
> 
> Taleb comes to the conclusion that we need to implement systematic ways to distinguish situations that need intervention—such as large-scale environmental damage—from situations that would be better off left alone.
