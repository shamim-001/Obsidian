## Chapter 2: Your Self-Image Defines Your Experience

In the previous chapter, we examined how Maltz reached the conclusion that our brains work according to cybernetic principles: Our brains operate to successfully reach targets and find solutions. This conclusion leads to the assumption that all we need to do to achieve success and happiness is to **decide on an appropriate goal and let our brain work like a machine** that’s been directed to work on a specific action—it will _automatically_ direct our thoughts and actions towards reaching that goal.

**Unfortunately, things aren’t that simple**: You may decide to achieve a goal, but deep down, _your brain may not be programmed to achieve that goal_. Maltz argues that **your conscious goals often differ from your internal programming**. For example, your conscious goal may be to make friends (results in success), but your internal programming might lead you to push people away (results in failure). This conflict between your conscious goal and your internal programming leads you to unhappiness and a feeling of failure because you can’t move past your internal programming.

(Shortform note: Maltz argues that when your conscious goals differ from your internal programming, you engage in self-defeating behaviors that thwart the goals you’ve set for yourself. You’ll recognize this in instances of [self-sabotage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-sabotage). Obvious forms of self-sabotage include procrastination (when you avoid taking action to achieve your goals) and unhealthy habits such as overeating when your goal is to lose weight, or overspending when your goal is to save.)

Why does this incongruence between your conscious goals and your internal programming occur? Maltz argues that it’s down to your **self-image**. In this chapter, we’ll examine:

- What your self-image is
- How your self-image develops
- How your self-image impacts your programming and, consequently your progress toward achieving your conscious goals

### What Is Your Self-Image?

Like a machine, your brain has recorded every experience you’ve had up until this moment—every failure, success, and interaction. **Your self-image is a reflection of how you’ve _identified with and felt about_ these experiences**. Your self-image defines who you are, how you express yourself, and how you act in any given situation.

For example, consider an experience such as falling over. You could either say to yourself, “I fell over” (a fact that won’t have an impact on your self-image), or you could say to yourself, “I’m a klutz!” (the way you identified with the experience, which _will_ have an impact on your self-image, and the way that you express yourself—for example, you may act overly cautious as a result of this identification).

> **Your Self-Image Impacts Your Self-Esteem**
> 
> Research developments in the area of self-identity indicate that [our self-image is just one of four interrelated components that inform our opinions of ourselves](https://positivepsychology.com/self-image-examples-activities/):
> 
> - **Self-image**: How you see yourself.
>     
> - **Ideal self**: How you would like to be seen by others.
>     
> - **Real self**: The feedback you receive from others shows you who you really are.
>     
> - **Looking glass self**: _How you perceive the way others perceive you_ and compare it to the way you see yourself.
>     
> 
> Further, the research shows that you’re more likely to have a healthy sense of self-esteem (how much you like and accept yourself) if your beliefs in each of the four components align with and complement each other.
> 
> In other words, the greater the difference of ideas within each component, the more likely you are to suffer from low self-esteem. For example, you see yourself as boring (your self-image) but you want others to see you as interesting (your ideal self). This gap between your self-image and your ideal self creates conflict and undermines your self-esteem.
> 
> It’s difficult to pinpoint the beliefs that inform your opinion of yourself in each of these areas. However, there are a number of tests you can take to discover what you really think about yourself such as [The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale](https://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Self-Esteem_ROSENBERG_SELF-ESTEEM.pdf) or [The Flourishing Scale](https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/The_Flourishing_Scale.pdf).

#### What Influences Your Self-Image?

Maltz argues that your self-image is not a real thing. It’s simply **a construct of thoughts you chose to think about past experiences**. Thoughts are subjective (for example, you may _think_ you’re fat but it doesn’t mean that you _are_ fat) and may or may not be true. But if you accept them as truth, they become part of your self-image.

Why does your self-image accept all of your thoughts, regardless of how inaccurate they are, as truth? Because your nervous system can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality: _Your brain doesn’t judge your thoughts_—instead, it reacts automatically to what you think or imagine to be true.

Maltz draws on the practice of hypnotism to make his point. He says that if you’re hypnotized into believing that you’re in a snowstorm, your body will react to the cold: you’ll shiver, goose pimples will rise on your skin, and your teeth will chatter. In the same way that a hypnotist’s words have power over the hypnotized subject, **what you accept as truth about yourself has power over you, even if it’s not actually true**.

Maltz argues that you’ve been “hypnotized” by others’ words throughout your life. As a young child, you were impressionable and prone to believing what those around you said about your character. You accepted their opinions and beliefs about you as truth and this shaped your self-image in the early part of your life. Your self-image has likely evolved over time, but if you haven’t addressed these original thoughts, they will continue to inform your opinion of yourself.

You’ve also used your imagination to hypnotize yourself: Thoughts plus feelings form mental images and create a strong impression in your mind—these strong impressions turn into beliefs that define your self-image. For example, worries are a form of mental imagery. You think about things that could go wrong and create feelings of anxiety and fear—these thoughts and feelings create the impression of the worst-case scenario in your mind. Your mind then operates according to the belief that the worst-case scenario will take place, and your nervous system responds by creating the appropriate emotional and physical reactions.

> **How Clinical Hypnotherapy Treats Psychological Problems**
> 
> Maltz focuses on the negative aspects of being “hypnotized” by others’ beliefs about you, but [clinical hypnotherapy can be an effective form of medical treatment](https://www.hypnotherapists.org.uk/4717/clinical-hypnotherapy/) and impact your self-image _positively_. This is because, as Maltz notes, your nervous system can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality.
> 
> Hypnotherapy is commonly used to treat a variety of psychological problems such as phobias, anxiety issues, weight management, and addictions. Psychological problems tend to have a clear trigger and response relationship. For example:
> 
> - Arachnophobia: You see a spider (trigger), and you panic (response).
>     
> - Anxiety: You think about how much work you have to do (trigger), and you immediately feel worried and overwhelmed (response).
>     
> - Addictions: You experience a particular feeling (trigger), and you feel overwhelmed by a craving for a particular substance (response).
>     
> 
> Clinical hypnotherapy treats these problems by helping you to:
> 
> - Identify the root cause of your problem: Why you respond to triggers in the way you do.
>     
> - Reprogram the way your mind responds to triggers: Replaces your negative response with a positive response.
>     
> 
> Clinical hypnotists put you in a relaxed, trance-like state so that they can bypass your conscious mind and offer suggestions directly to your subconscious mind—while you're in this state, your conscious mind doesn’t actively “resist” these new suggestions. However, hypnotists can’t force you to do something against your will—you’re always aware of what’s going on around you, and you remain in control.
> 
> Successful hypnotherapy sessions create new trigger and response relationships in your mind. For example:
> 
> - Arachnophobia: You see a spider (trigger), and you feel calm (new response).
>     
> - Anxiety: You think about how much work you have to do (trigger), and you’re able to think clearly and prioritize your work (new response).
>     
> - Addictions: You experience a particular feeling (trigger), and you’re able to seek a positive outlet for your emotions (response).
>     
> 
> The theme, as the book suggests, is that your brain behaves according to trigger-response pairs that it believes to be true but aren’t actually valid. With training, you can rewire them.

### How Does Your Self-Image Impact Your Programming?

We’ll discuss two ways your self-image impacts the way you’re programmed to behave: by processing feedback and influencing your subconscious.

#### Your Self-Image Processes Feedback

Maltz argues that the self-image is continually reinforced by what he calls “feedback loops”—how feedback reinforces learned behavior and programming—and draws parallels with how cybernetic machines incorporate feedback to operate successfully. Therefore, we’ll explain how both machines and humans rely upon feedback loops to “operate” and why your _interpretation of feedback_ reinforces your patterns of behavior.

Machines process feedback so that they can achieve their goal. Once they achieve the goal, they store their successful feedback (memory of successful attempts) and discard their negative feedback (memory of mistakes and failures). **Their _memory_ of successful attempts creates a feedback loop that allows them to “learn” quickly and operate efficiently and successfully**.

However, unlike a machine, humans rely on their self-images to interpret feedback to their behavior. _Your self-image decides_ whether to release negative feedback so that you **operate successfully** (behave in a way that results in success), or to remember and reinforce negative feedback so that you **operate inefficiently** (behave in a way that creates failure). If your self-image decides to focus on negative feedback, this can lead to programming that causes you to reinforce negative patterns of behavior that work against what you want to achieve.

##### An Example of Unhelpful Feedback Loops

The following example illustrates how negative feedback loops take place to reinforce negative programming:

1. Bob was bullied at school and failed to receive support from his classmates, parents, or teachers.
2. Bob identified with feeling victimized and isolated, and these feelings contributed to his self-image and his personality.
3. As an adult, he finds it difficult to trust others and form close relationships, and he is overly sensitive to how others respond to him. This difficulty to connect with others is expressed in various ways, from aloofness to hostility, but produces the same effect—his behavior keeps people at a distance.
4. Bob reads these signals (the feedback) from others as proof that others don’t want to connect with him and he remains acutely aware of how they make him feel (victimized and isolated).
5. He uses his interpretation and feelings as proof that he should continue to protect himself from social interactions.

Bob _wants to connect with others_ (his goal) but his self-image causes him to interpret all feedback as negative, stops him from moving towards what he wants, and perpetuates his self-isolation.

Maltz argues that your self-image determines how you perceive your environment and how you read signals to interpret what others think of you. In other words, your self-image determines how you engage in and perceive every social interaction and experience throughout your life. Feedback loops direct your behavior: **Your interpretation of your environment justifies your self-image and how you continue to act**—how you continue to act further reinforces your interpretation of your environment, and so on.

> **How Unconscious Biases Reinforce Feedback Loops**
> 
> While you may believe that your perceptions and reactions to your environment are entirely logical, you may be under the influence of _unconscious_ biases that reinforce patterns of behavior that you would rather not engage in.
> 
> Research shows that your dominant personality traits and patterns of behavior are influenced by [cognitive biases](https://www.verywellmind.com/cognitive-biases-distort-thinking-2794763). These biases are the result of your brain’s attempt to make quick judgments based on your past experiences, and they shape the way you think about and perceive your environment.
> 
> There are many different types of cognitive biases, and each of them influences your perceptions in different ways. For example, Bob’s experience suggests that his behavior is influenced by [Confirmation Bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias)—the tendency to pay more attention to the information that confirms and reinforces his opinion (people don’t like him).
> 
> Bob doesn’t _want_ to have this belief—his past experiences led him to form this belief. However, the confirmation bias shapes his perception so that he can only notice and interpret interactions and experiences that reinforce this belief. As a result, Bob continues to act defensively because his bias ensures that he continues to mistrust others.

#### Your Self-Image Influences Your Subconscious Mind

Another way that self-image impacts your programming is by influencing your subconscious mind. Your **subconscious** mind is a reservoir of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are beneath your conscious awareness. **It records and stores your every experience**. (In contrast, your **conscious** mind contains all of the thoughts and feelings that you’re aware of at any given moment.)

> **Your Subconscious Mind Is Always Awake**
> 
> There is still much to be learned about how the subconscious mind works. However, neuroscientists have confirmed that [95% of your brain activity takes place beyond your conscious awareness](https://www.gailmarrahypnotherapy.com/9-interesting-facts-about-your-subconscious-mind/), _in your subconscious mind_. Further, research reveals that your subconscious mind makes decisions about how you choose to feel or act _before_ your conscious mind even perceives the need to make a decision.
> 
> In addition, your subconscious mind is always alert—one of its jobs is to control your bodily functions and processes so it stays awake even while you’re asleep. Even if you’re not consciously aware of something happening in your environment, **your subconscious mind is paying attention to every little detail, and recording the entire experience**.

##### Your Self-Image Is the “Operator” and Your Subconscious Is the “Machine”

Maltz argues that while you may consciously decide upon a goal, it’s your subconscious mind that guides you towards achieving it. In fact, **your subconscious mind is _always_ directing you towards a goal, even if you’re not aware of it**.

But how does your subconscious mind decide whether or not to pursue a goal? The answer lies with your self-image. **Your self-image programs your subconscious mind to achieve goals.** If you have a positive self-image, your subconscious works to help you achieve your goals. If you have a negative self-image, your subconscious works to sabotage your goals.

- For example, if your self-image tells your subconscious mind that you’re good at and enjoy cooking, you’ll approach your time in the kitchen with confidence. However, if your self-image tells your subconscious mind that you hate cooking and always make the most awful meals, you’ll approach the task with a feeling of trepidation. In both cases, **the way you think and feel impacts how competently you prepare your meal**, and the results that you get (enjoyable meal or terrible meal).

Like a machine, _your subconscious mind works automatically and impersonally to achieve the goals that your self-image sets for it_, and your behaviors depend on how your self-image has programmed your subconscious to act. Your subconscious mind believes your self-image to be true and doesn’t question what your self-image programs it to do (like a calculator doesn’t care about the numbers you input). Therefore, **your self-image dictates the limits of your accomplishments**.

Recall Bob and the feedback loop that kept him in a state of self-isolation. Bob’s behavior clearly illustrates how _subconscious goals direct experience_. Consciously, Bob wants to make friends. He doesn’t understand why people don’t like him. He is unable to see that his behavior towards others encourages them to respond to him in a certain way. Bob’s self-image directs his subconscious to protect him from social interactions. No matter how much Bob wants to engage with others, his subconscious brings up fearful thoughts and feelings that hold him back, and **limit him from succeeding**.

##### Your Subconscious Follows Your Real Self-Image, No Matter What

**If the goals you consciously set for yourself are inconsistent with the subconscious goals your self-image sets for you, your subconscious will reject them**. Maltz argues that no amount of willpower or positive thinking will change your results unless you make a conscious attempt to change your self-image and your beliefs. The person who _believes_ she’s a terrible cook will never enjoy cooking no matter how many times she superficially affirms to herself “I’m an excellent cook” (_she says it but doesn’t believe it_) since her subconscious mind isn’t taking instructions from her, but from her self-image (where her _real beliefs_ are stored).

So, if you’ve identified with being a failure so often that it’s now a part of your self-image, then no matter how hard you work towards achieving something, your subconscious will always find a way for you to fail. If you’ve identified yourself as a victim of circumstances, then your subconscious will always lead you to situations that make you feel powerless. The feedback loop (your behavior plus your interpretation of your experience) will continue to reinforce this pattern.

Maltz, therefore, concludes that, if you want to achieve success and happiness—according to the goals you’ve consciously set out for yourself—**you need to ensure that you have a positive self-image**. This is the only way to ensure that your subconscious works with you to achieve your idea of success, rather than leading you down a path that works against what you want.

> **The Difference Between _Psycho-Cybernetics_ and the Law of Attraction**
> 
> The Law of Attraction (LoA) also claims that what you _really believe about yourself_ subconsciously impacts the way you perceive and react to your experiences. It’s centered around the belief that you get what you focus on: Positive thoughts lead to positive consequences, and negative thoughts lead to negative consequences. However, the LoA is based upon a fundamentally different foundation from _Psycho-Cybernetics_: Rather than your self-image defining your reality, **[the “universe” orchestrates your reality according to your thoughts and beliefs](https://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/)**.
> 
> Maltz argues that your self-image programs your “subconscious mind” to achieve goals, and your subconscious mind then dictates your behavior and your actions. **The key argument here is that your behavior and _your actions define the limits of your accomplishments_**—your subconscious mind is in charge of your success.
> 
> In contrast, the LoA replaces your “subconscious mind” with “universal” or “source” energy. It claims that your frequency (what the LoA calls your thoughts and beliefs) sends a signal to the universe, and the universe then _coordinates your reality to match your frequency_. **The key argument here is that your frequency defines the limits of what the universe _delivers to you_**—the universe is in charge of your success.
> 
> Let’s continue with the cooking example to make the distinction clear. According to Maltz, your self-image determines the actions you take to get results—whether your meal is successful or not depends entirely on your self-image because it defines whether your actions support or work against your goal to make a good meal. According to the LoA, your frequency has to align with the results you want to create so that the universe can orchestrate your reality around your desire to make a successful meal. How does it orchestrate your reality? Here are a few different examples of what the universe may deliver to you to help you create a successful meal:
> 
> - You’re online when you notice a very easy recipe that inspires you to get in the kitchen and start cooking.
>     
> - Your friend, who happens to be an excellent cook, comes over for a surprise visit and ends up helping you to make dinner.
>     
> - You feel inspired to join a cooking class to improve your skills—the class you want to join happens to offer a discount.
>     
> 
> However, if your thoughts and beliefs on the subject of cooking are negative, the universe will create experiences that align with your negative frequency—in other words, you’re going to experience difficulties that make it impossible for you to cook a successful meal. Here are a few different examples of what the universe may deliver to you:
> 
> - Your local store runs out of the ingredients you need.
>     
> - Your oven malfunctions so you end up having to abandon the meal.
>     
> - You make the meal, but your family criticizes it and you end up in tears.
>     
> 
> While advocates of the law of attraction believe that you can consciously change your thoughts to create better outcomes, Maltz maintains that you can’t force your subconscious mind to think differently. For Maltz, the only path to positive outcomes is a positive self-image.
