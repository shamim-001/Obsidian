## Principle #6: Committed Action

In the last chapter, you learned about values, the deep-seated principles that govern how we act.

In this chapter, you will learn about the final principle of ACT: committed action. Harris explains that **committed action happens when we consistently take actions that align with our values—even when we fail.** This final principle will give you all the tools you need to achieve psychological flexibility, enabling you to adapt to difficult situations and take effective action to build a rich and meaningful life.

This chapter begins by demonstrating how to translate our values into action via goal-setting and action plans. Then, we’ll discuss the two components of committed action: fortitude and commitment. Finally, we’ll tie together everything we’ve learned throughout this guide and present the ultimate choice of the ACT practitioner.

### Translating Values to Goals

Harris argues that knowing our values isn’t sufficient for us to live fulfilled lives—we also have to take effective action, or action aligned with our values. **In order to take effective action, we have to translate our values into achievable goals.**

#### Goal-Setting: A Five-Step Exercise

In the last chapter, you came up with a list of values in four domains. In order to translate these values into goals, we’ll divide them into 11 more specific areas:

1. Family
2. Marriage and other romantic relationships
3. Friendships
4. Work and career
5. Education and personal development
6. Spirituality
7. Citizenship and community
8. Environment and nature
9. Health and wellness
10. Leisure

(Shortform note: These categories aren’t iron-clad. If you feel that one of the domains isn’t applicable to you, feel free to eliminate it from the list. Likewise, if you find that you have a significant cluster of values related to a domain that isn’t listed, create a new domain and focus your efforts there.)

Now, take a look at each category and determine the one where you feel _least_ in touch with your values. If you’ve identified more than one domain, determine which of the domains has the most urgent or pressing need for your attention. Harris emphasizes that you pick only one domain—focusing on more than one is likely to be overwhelming and lead to decreased morale (or even abandonment of the process).

**1. Now that you’ve selected a domain, write a summary of the values you’re interested in focusing on**. For instance, if you selected friendship, you may want to work on the values of being an attentive, kind, and honest friend.

**2. Set a goal related to one of these values that you can accomplish _today_.** The easier this goal, the better. Starting small is a good way to ensure that you actually follow through with effective action.

When setting a goal, list what, where, and when. The “what” should be specific—for example, instead of saying, “I’m going to be nice,” say, “I’m going to say one nice thing to my friend.” Specifying the “where” and “when” make the goal more well-defined and achievable, which helps you avoid procrastinating or abandoning the goal.

Additionally, avoid setting prohibitive goals, or goals focused on _not_ doing something. To avoid this, consider what you would like to do _instead_ of doing the thing you don’t want to do. Then, set a goal to do that alternative.

**3. Set some goals that you can achieve within the next week.** Remember to specify the “what,” the “where,” and the “when.” For instance, if your value in the marriage domain is to be more affectionate with your spouse, you might say, “I’m going to cook a nice, intimate dinner for my spouse at the house this Friday.”

**4. Set some goals that you can achieve within the next few weeks or months.** Again, specify the “what,” the “where,” and the “when.”

**5. Set some goals that you can achieve with years’ worth of effort.** This is an opportunity to be ambitious with your goal-setting. It doesn’t matter how realistic you think these goals are in the present moment—if it occurs to you, write it down. For example, if your value in the domain of employment is doing something that truly benefits other people, you might write, “I’ll go back to school in order to change careers from data entry to biomedical engineering.”

> **Set Purpose-Driven Goals**
> 
> In _[First Things First](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first)_, Stephen R. Covey has a slightly different take on [how to set meaningful goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first/chapter-7). He suggests three strategies:
> 
> **1. Set recurring goals**. In Covey’s formulation, your goals should follow a “mission,” a “vision,” and “principles”—rather than just the values that Harris has you define. Whereas Harris’s approach involves setting goals that you can accomplish within one week and then moving onto the next step, Covey recommends _recurring_ goals that you consistently accomplish week after week. For instance, instead of setting a goal to cook dinner for your spouse on Friday this week, you would set a goal to cook dinner for your spouse _every_ Friday.
> 
> This recurring framework aligns with ACT because, as discussed, values involve consistent and repeated behavior. It’s not enough to do something once and then consider the value fulfilled.
> 
> **2. Set “context” goals**. Covey recommends that you set mid- to long-term goals that your weekly goals build toward. In defining context goals, Covey suggests considering the “what” (the goal itself), “why” (the reason for the goal; in ACT, the “why” will also be the underlying value), and “how” (the means by which you will reach the goal).
> 
> For example, if your weekly goal is eating one serving of vegetables with every meal, your longer-term goal may be to switch to a vegetarian diet (the “what”). You set this goal because you want to eat healthier (the “why,” or value), and you’re going to achieve this by setting mid-term goals to replace two servings of meat per week with legumes.
> 
> **3. Make a “perhaps” list**. A “perhaps” list is filled with goals that you’re not fully committing to but would like to record as possibilities. This is a break from the relatively rigid structure that accompanies goal-setting, and it may help you formulate more ambitious goals in the future. Harris includes this kind of thinking when he recommends setting goals that aren’t necessarily realistic in the long-term goals category.

#### Making an Action Plan

Now that you’ve set some goals, it’s time to make an action plan. Harris explains that an action plan breaks down each goal into manageable steps so that you don’t get overwhelmed.

An action plan has three parts. Ask:

1. **What steps will I need to take to achieve this goal?** For example, if you’ve set a goal of going camping, you may need to:

- Research best camping practices
- Find good campsites near you
- Buy a tent or other camping supplies
- Block out the necessary time to go camping

1. **What materials do I need to achieve this goal?** For example, if you don’t already have a tent to go camping, you’ll need to buy (or borrow) one.
2. **When will I act to achieve my goal?** For example, you may decide that, given the time that it will take for you to purchase all of the necessary camping equipment, you’ll go camping a month from now.

Once you’ve answered these questions, you have an action plan.

> **An Alternative Approach to Action Plans**
> 
> In _[The Psychology of Selling](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-psychology-of-selling)_, Brian Tracy presents another way to turn your goals into actions. Tracy’s method reorders and combines Harris’s steps, but most significantly, Tracy also adds a step: prioritizing the to-dos in your action plan. Considering Harris states that action plans are meant to make goals more manageable, this step makes the action plan even more manageable.
> 
> This is Tracy’s approach:
> 
> - **Write your goal down.** This makes your goal real. If you’ve been following Harris’s exercises, you’ve already done this step.
>     
> - **Set a deadline.** Tracy argues that by defining the “when” of your goal first, you set your subconscious mind working on the other steps necessary to achieve your goal. This reverses the order Harris suggests, which specifies the “when” in the final step.
>     
> - **Make a list of everything you can do to achieve your goal.** This is similar to steps 1 and 2 of Harris’s method, combining the manageable steps you’ll need to take to achieve your goal with the added complexity of the materials you’ll need to achieve it.
>     
> - **Organize this list.** Prioritize the actions to figure out which steps need to be completed first and which can wait until later.
>     
> - **Take action.**
>     

### Element #1: Fortitude—Accepting the Unpleasant

By this point, we’ve set some goals and made an action plan. Harris clarifies that these are the necessary components of effective action, but not _committed_ action. As we’ve discussed, **c**ommitted action is effective action coupled with fortitude and commitment.

**Harris defines fortitude as accepting that effective action comes with unwanted side effects, such as negative thoughts, feelings, and urges.** Fortitude doesn’t necessarily imply that we enjoy or welcome these side effects—uncomfortable thoughts and feelings are difficult, maybe impossible, to enjoy. However, fortitude does mean being fully present in our lives even when we don’t enjoy the thoughts and feelings we’re experiencing.

We all must practice fortitude to engage with society. For instance, when we buy food, spending money is an undesired side effect—but it’s one that we’re willing to accept.

Fortitude is also necessary to live a meaningful life. When we confront an obstacle, we either practice fortitude to deal with it or we don’t. If we don’t practice fortitude, then we close ourselves off to the possibilities of life. **If we practice fortitude, we can overcome that obstacle even if it causes us pain.**

> **The 4 C’s of Mental Toughness**
> 
> The idea of mental fortitude, or toughness, is a loaded term in American culture. You can find hundreds of people trying to sell their own particular brand of mental toughening online—and almost none of these align with what Harris proposes in _The Happiness Trap_. One of the most common models for mental fortitude is called the [4 C’s of mental toughness](https://positivepsychology.com/mentally-strong/):
> 
> - **Control** your emotions and your life circumstances. By contrast, Harris’s model emphasizes that our emotions are entirely outside of our control, and that all we can do is to _manage_ them.
>     
> - **Commitment** is the ability to set and achieve goals consistently. While goal-setting is also part of Harris’s model, ACT emphasizes that these goals must align with your values.
>     
> - **Challenge** means seeking the highest possible challenges for yourself and adapting quickly to adversity. While ACT doesn’t specifically advocate seeking challenges, it does hold that _challenges are opportunities for growth._
>     
> - **Confidence** is your belief in yourself and your ability to influence others. ACT doesn’t promote self-esteem, which stems from your thinking self judging you to be worthy, but rather self-acceptance, which grows from connection with your observing self. .
>     

### Element #2: Commitment—Persevering Despite Failure

While fortitude is accepting the undesirable side effects of effective action, **commitment is accepting that failure is inevitable, while also knowing that no failure is final.**

For example, most people have been speaking since they were toddlers, and yet no one speaks so perfectly that they do not occasionally stumble over a word in a sentence. Without commitment, we would take that failure as final: an unavoidable sign that our efforts to speak without mistakes are doomed, and so we might as well stop speaking.

In the context of ACT, Harris says that commitment means continuing to pursue effective action even if you sometimes fail to meet your goals. The emphasis on commitment is important because we can’t know whether we’ll ever actually accomplish any specific goal we set for ourselves. **Only by pursuing effective action regardless of whether we succeed or fail can we continue to act effectively.**

Every time we fail to meet a goal, we have the opportunity to practice commitment. ACT emphasizes that you can treat any problem as an opportunity for personal growth. The alternative is to fall back into the happiness trap: When we struggle to come to terms with our failures, we generate more negative thoughts and emotions.

Harris explains that practicing commitment is a three-step process:

1. **Recognize and fully accept your situation.** This can involve the mindfulness techniques of defusion, expansion, and connection.
2. **Ask yourself what action you can take now** that connects with your values.
3. **Take the action you’ve decided on.** Sometimes, there won’t be an immediate action you can take; this is when you can practice the “acceptance” portion of ACT with defusion, expansion, and connection.

Sometimes commitment alone isn’t enough, and you must recognize that the actions that you’re taking aren’t having a meaningful impact on a situation. For instance, if you’re trying to hammer a nail with a piece of rope, the problem isn’t your commitment—you need the awareness to grab a hammer when you need one. In order to have this kind of awareness, rely on your mindfulness skills to connect to the situation.

> **Commitment Requires Grit**
> 
> Grit is a similar concept to what Harris calls commitment. In _[Grit](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit)_, Angela Duckworth emphasizes that grit is a combination of passion and perseverance, and she defines perseverance as Harris defines commitment: having the resilience to overcome setbacks and work hard to finish.
> 
> Here are [five ways to embody grit](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201411/getting-grit):
> 
> - **Shift your perspective**. Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it doesn’t have to be negative—instead, it’s an opportunity to try again, or try something different.
>     
> - **Don’t bother trying to be perfect**. One reason failure can be so difficult to stomach is that it challenges the idea that we can be flawless. Instead, let go of that ideal, develop humility, and try again.
>     
> - **Get used to living outside of your comfort zone**. Failures lead us to circumstances that feel foreign or uncertain. When you accept this discomfort, you’ll find even more opportunities to learn from your mistakes.
>     
> - **Don’t be afraid to seek support**. While Harris emphasizes an individualistic approach to escaping the happiness trap, you don’t have to face failure alone. Lean on your support system—they may even offer unexpected lessons.
>     
> - **Focus on your goals**. Failure doesn’t mean that you have to abandon your goals. You may simply need to try again—or try a new strategy.
>     

### ACT in Action: A Simple Choice

Now you’re familiar with each of the six principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: Connecting with the observing self, defusion, expansion, connection, clarifying values, and committed action.

Harris writes that these principles are not intended as a mandatory set of rules—rather, they’re intended to be applied practically. Use a technique when you think it will prove useful. In cases where you think another approach is more appropriate, do that instead.

That said, the principles of ACT are simple to apply to your life. **Whenever you encounter a problem, you have two options in ACT**:

1. **Apply your mindfulness skills to accept the problem**. Practice defusion, expansion, and connection to connect with your observing self.
2. **Take action in accordance with your values to solve the problem**. Often, you’ll do this after you’ve already used your mindfulness skills to connect with the situation.

This choice probably seems simplistic, but it takes the two elements that are directly under your control (your observing self and your actions) and harnesses them to deal with any problem you encounter. According to Harris, with this skill set, you can effectively move past the happiness trap.

> **A Third Option for Dealing With Problems**
> 
> In _[The Power of Now](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/1-page-summary),_ Eckhart Tolle identifies something similar to Harris’s two-option structure. While Harris argues that you must be present in order to accept a problem (option 1), Tolle asserts that you must be present in order to acknowledge the problem and pursue _any_ options. In [Tolle’s version of problem-solving](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/solution-part-1), you have three options:
> 
> - **Change the situation** (if you can). In other words, take effective action.
>     
> - **Leave the situation** (if you can). In other words, take effective action. (This assumes that leaving the situation would be in alignment with your values.)
>     
> - **Accept the situation as it is.** If you can’t change or leave the situation, you may be forced to accept it forever, or at least until things change and you can take another action.
>     
> 
> Although two of Tolle’s options could be considered effective actions—essentially making the list identical to Harris’s—there is value in distinguishing between the option of _changing_ and _leaving_ the situation. It can be easy to get so caught up in a problem that it feels that the only actions we can take must be within the context of that situation, but Tolle reminds us that leaving is often a viable option, too.
