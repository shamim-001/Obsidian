## Part 1.1: Myths About Happiness

Harris explains that we have many misguided beliefs about happiness. These widely held beliefs trap us in vicious cycles that actually increase—rather than decrease—our suffering.

This chapter will discuss four common myths about happiness, and debunk them with human psychology rooted in empirical evidence, rather than cultural misconceptions.

### Myth #1: Humans Are Naturally Happy

**Our society constantly reinforces the idea that everybody can (and should) be happy**.

Harris points out that happiness is widely regarded as the most desirable human state. The pursuit of happiness is even enshrined as a fundamental human right, alongside life and liberty, in the US Declaration of Independence.

Harris writes that the media and the internet bombard us with images of people who are beautiful, intelligent, and wealthy—and presumably happy. We envy them and believe we should strive to be like them. (Shortform note: Many companies also sell happiness by promising their products will make you happy. The late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh wrote a 2010 book, _Delivering Happiness_, in which he argued that the way to build a successful business, and to be happy yourself, is to take extraordinary steps to make your employees and customers happy.)

All of this combines to make it seem like happiness is humanity’s natural state. But **although we expect to be happy today, our minds weren’t designed to work that way**.

The human brain has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years in conditions that don’t even slightly resemble modern society, but we retain certain evolutionary traits. Harris specifies three traits that primitive humans needed to survive:

1. The ability to detect threats and avoid them. If a primitive human couldn’t detect the venomous snake coiled in the grass at his feet, he’d get bitten (and probably die).
2. The ability to fit into a group. If a primitive human couldn’t function well within his clan, he would be kicked out and left to fend for himself (and probably die).
3. An accumulate-and-improve mentality. If a primitive human couldn’t accumulate enough food to last his clan through a drought, not only would he not survive, but neither would his immediate relatives.

Human beings with these traits were more likely to survive and reproduce than humans without them. Accordingly, these traits have persisted on the evolutionary time scale, although they’re not helpful to us today.

(Shortform note: Another often-unhelpful adaptation is our inclination to [accept our perceptions as reality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-happy-life/202008/why-cant-we-handle-the-truth), rather than seeking the truth. In some cases, this adaptation persisted because our ancestors simply didn’t _need_ to know the truth—if they wrongly believed that the sun revolved around the earth, it had no impact on their survival. In other cases, acting on perceptions was a form of threat-aversion: For example, believing that people who are different are inherently dangerous helped our ancestors avoid threats from potentially hostile strangers and tribes. However, this biased fear creates harmful divides in diverse modern societies.)

Harris explains that **the same traits that ensured that our ancestors survived and reproduced in prehistoric times make our suffering practically inevitable in the modern world**. He notes that these three traits have become dysfunctional because:

1) **We no longer need threat detection and avoidance to protect us from predators in the wild. Instead, this instinct makes us detect imaginary threats,** such as the possibility that we’ll never get married, or that the random ache in our body is a symptom of a rare and potentially fatal disease. These anxieties make us unhappy.

(Shortform note: In some cases, our desire to avoid threats can become [hypervigilance or hyperalertness—extreme alertness and sensitivity to your environment, which is associated with mental health problems such as PTSD](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypervigilance#treatment).)

2) The ability to fit in is no longer the deciding factor in whether we starve to death, but we still compare ourselves to others and worry about whether we are normal. In the world of social media, where everybody is pushing an idealized version of themselves, this part of our brain looks at others and makes us worry that we compare unfavorably.

(Shortform note: [Social comparison theory](https://dictionary.apa.org/social-comparison-theory) describes this human inclination to determine our self-worth based on how we compare with others. At its best, social comparisons can sometimes motivate us to improve—which raises our self-esteem—when we compare ourselves to people who excel in one particular trait, but who are otherwise similar to ourselves. At its worst, social comparison can make us feel insecure or arrogant, depending on whether we make upward comparisons (judging ourselves against people we deem superior) or downward comparisons (judging ourselves against those we deem inferior).)

3) Our ability to accumulate and improve no longer determines whether we live or die. Still, our brains drive us to constantly accumulate more wealth, status, and happiness and to improve our lives as much as possible—but even when we accomplish these goals and improve our lives, the satisfaction doesn’t last long. For example, if you’ve wanted to upgrade your car for a while, the thrill of buying a new one lasts for a few weeks or months. But before long, the new car has become ordinary and you set your sights even higher—we quickly return to the cycle of accumulation and try to get even more.

> **The Futility of the Chase for More**
> 
> Society reinforces this psychological adaptation through marketing and idealized media portrayals of rich and famous people. Together, these forces make us believe that a material gain—like a job, house, or income level—will be the key to happiness. However, this drive for more leads to our detriment for multiple reasons. First, in our relentless pursuit of that one thing, we [often neglect their health and relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-meaningful-life/201810/got-meaning), creating more unhappiness.
> 
> Additionally, as noted, that one thing is never enough—we are wired to want more. However, according to prospect theory, [the more you accumulate, the less satisfaction you feel](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/part-4) from the additional gains. As a result, we continually chase more wealth, status, and happiness while getting diminishing satisfaction from our pursuits.

In other words, not only is the belief that humans are naturally happy not true, but Harris contends the opposite is true. Because our minds naturally supply us with a constant stream of threats, worries, and concerns that don’t actually contribute to our survival, **the natural state for human beings is psychological discomfort.** (Shortform note: [Studies of brain activity show that we have a “negativity bias”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201907/you-arent-built-be-happy)—our brains respond more to negative images than to positive or neutral images. ACT founder Steven C. Hayes identified five ways our brains fixate on the negative: imagining dangers, ruminating about the past, worrying about what others think, feeling not good enough, and always needing more.)

> **The Limits of Evolutionary Psychology**
> 
> [Evolutionary psychology, which links mental traits to natural selection, has been criticized](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-darkness/201412/how-valid-is-evolutionary-psychology) on the grounds that:
> 
> - There is no way to test its hypotheses.
>     
> - We have little insight into the environment in which our human ancestors lived.
>     
> - Political and cultural bias are confounding factors that make it unclear whether evolutionary psychology explains current human behavior or merely justifies it.
>     
> 
> However, there is plenty of nuance to be brought to the discussion. For instance, although the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are not testable, neither is the hypothesis that the universe was created from the Big Bang, but we still hold the latter to be the best working theory of the origins of the universe.
> 
> The evolutionary claims of _The Happiness Trap_ are broad enough to appear plausible on the surface, but it’s important to understand that there’s a high degree of speculation at play. The idea that the tendencies Harris describes are modern-day expressions of a primitive drive is one working hypothesis, but it may discount the role that capitalist culture plays in generating desires that serve no adaptive purpose. In other words, our desire to buy a shiny new car may have nothing to do with an ancient accumulate-and-improve instinct, but rather a desire cultivated by consumerist culture.
> 
> However, at least some evidence supports the idea that the threat detection and avoidance mechanism is a vestige of our ancestors: Researchers found that [anxiety is partially attributed to genetics](https://www.livescience.com/51477-anxious-brains-are-inherited.html) in rhesus monkeys, which are similar to human primates. That means that there is some credence to the idea that an overactive threat detection and avoidance mechanism has a genetic component to it and could therefore be passed down from our ancient ancestors to modern humans.

### Myth #2: There’s Something Wrong With Unhappy People

Harris argues that one consequence of the first myth is that **assuming humans are naturally happy suggests something is wrong with anyone who is unhappy** or experiences psychological distress. We may characterize an unhappy person as “weak.” This is the underlying premise when one person tells another to “toughen up,” as though emotions were a kind of threat that can simply be faced down and defeated (and happiness floods into the gap left by the banished emotion, says the myth).

Harris explains that social media reinforces this second myth by providing a platform where people can display only the best parts of their lives, which give the impression of maximum happiness. It’s easy to look at these projections of other people’s happiness and feel that your life doesn’t measure up. Some people then conclude that there must be something wrong with them.

However, because humans are not, in fact, naturally happy, **there’s nothing inherently wrong with unhappy individuals.**

> **The Harms of Treating Unhappiness as a Problem**
> 
> Research has shown that this myth—that being unhappy means that there’s something wrong with you—is misguided. Furthermore, actually treating your negative thoughts and feelings as a problem can [create secondary emotions](https://hbr.org/2020/11/its-okay-to-not-be-okay), such as shame and guilt, that intensify your psychological suffering.
> 
> Despite this, modern psychologists consider some typical signs of unhappiness when diagnosing psychiatric disorders. For instance, [symptoms of depression](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007) include feelings of sadness, angry outbursts, and anxiety. In order to diagnose an individual with depression, these symptoms have to be so overwhelming that they affect the individual’s ability to function in society—but even for individuals without diagnosed depression, these symptoms are pathologized (or linked to mental illness) and regarded as potentially problematic.
> 
> On the other hand, some experts argue that [depression is an evolutionary adaptation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027858460600008X?via%3Dihub) meant to trigger social support, among other purposes. According to this hypothesis, diagnosing and treating depression does not worsen the problem—rather, those are modern forms of help that depressive symptoms exist to elicit.

### Myth #3: We Achieve Happiness by Eliminating Negative Feelings

**Society tells us that we should seek to get rid of our mental suffering and replace it with positive feelings.** This is the theme in some advertisements with a before-and-after structure. The world around a person using an inferior product is dark and gloomy. It’s only after buying the product advertised that the world becomes bright and positive. The implicit message is that you should do everything in your power to transform your dull, unhappy life into a happy one (in this case, buy a product). (Shortform note: This advertising approach is a strategy in [emotional marketing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emotion-marketing), which uses color, storytelling, ideal images, and associations to trigger consumers’ emotions that motivate them to act in certain ways. Research shows that a consumer’s emotional response to an ad is [two to three times more influential](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-the-consumer-mind/201302/how-emotions-influence-what-we-buy) than the ad’s content in swaying their decision to buy the product.)

However, if we consider the problem more deeply, it becomes clear that even experiences that we regard as positive carry with them a negative counterpart.

For instance, many people consider having a child to be one of the highest forms of happiness. But having a child is a positive experience that has many potentially negative feelings associated with it, such as the stress of sleepless nights when your child is an infant, the fear that your child won’t be accepted by her peers, and anger when your child is a disobedient teenager. The positive experience can’t exist without its negative counterparts.

Therefore, **we cannot achieve our deepest happiness without also experiencing potentially negative feelings.**

> **Don’t Reject Negative Feelings—Accept Them**
> 
> Although society pressures us to reject negative feelings, [accepting all of your feelings can enhance self-esteem](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-smarts/201907/four-ways-improve-self-esteem). When we separate self-esteem from the experience of positive feelings, we free ourselves from the myth that we’re defective if we’re not happy, and we release ourselves from the (futile) task of trying to eliminate our negative feelings. This allows us to value ourselves as we are—negative feelings and all—rather than as we’d like to be (people who don’t experience negative emotions).
> 
> Furthermore, humans vary on the scale of [dispositional negativity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/healthy-minds/202106/3-ways-curb-negative-mental-habits), or the degree to which we experience negative emotions relative to context. For instance, someone with high dispositional negativity may get cut off in traffic in the morning and still be thinking about the experience later that night. Someone with low dispositional negativity could experience the same thing and recover five minutes later. In addition, people with high dispositional negativity can experience negative emotion even if there is no appropriate context for that emotion—for example, they can feel down even when there’s no apparent reason.
> 
> Instead of suggesting that people with high dispositional negativity simply think happier thoughts, or eliminate their negative feelings, psychologists recommend that they accept their negative thoughts and feelings without judgment.

### Myth #4: You Can Control Your Thoughts and Feelings

Harris derives the fourth myth about happiness from the third: **Implicit in the belief that you _should_ eliminate negative feelings is the belief that you _can_ eliminate negative feelings. This misguided belief is constantly reinforced.**

Starting in childhood, we’re socialized to believe we should be able to control our feelings. Think of a parent telling their toddler to “be a big boy” and stop crying. We learn, at some point in our development, that we should control our negative thoughts and feelings—or, at the very least, the expression thereof.

> **How Children Learn They “Should” Control Their Emotions**
> 
> Research has identified [three dominant ways](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1513625/) we’re socialized to experience our emotions in early childhood:
> 
> - How our parents react to our emotions: If a parent tells their child to stop crying, the child thinks they _should_ be able to stop, even though children have poor impulse control.
>     
> - How our parents discuss emotions: If a parent tells a child to control their anger, the child picks up the idea that anger is bad.
>     
> - How parents express emotion: If a child sees a parent trying to control their own emotions, the child assumes that they can and should learn how to control their emotions, too.
>     
> 
> Similarly, as children get older, they pick up further lessons about emotions from their peers, through:
> 
> - How their peers react to their emotions
>     
> - How their peers discuss emotions
>     
> - How their peers express emotion
>     

Furthermore, Harris writes that we assume we have control over our thoughts and emotions because, as humans, we’re able to control the physical world and transform it for our use. It’s hard to accept that the same species that invented the internal combustion engine by harnessing the power of fire, steel, and steam can’t simply dismiss an unhappy thought.

Finally, he points out that this myth is one of the fundamental claims of many self-help books, such as _[The Happiness Advantage](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage/1-page-summary)_ and _[The Power of Positive Thinking](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking)_. These books argue that you can control your thoughts and feelings to replace negative thoughts, like anger and guilt, with positive ones, like joy and gratitude.

However, Harris argues that **we actually exert less control over our thoughts and feelings than we think we do**: Tell yourself not to think of an elephant. Now, you’re probably thinking of an elephant. Therefore, you don’t control your thoughts.

Plus, he writes that the more intense our negative thoughts become, the more difficult they are to control. So while it may be possible to dismiss something minor, like irritation that your child is chewing with their mouth open, it would be much more difficult to dismiss grief over a loved one’s death.

> **Most Thoughts Are Beyond Our Awareness and Control**
> 
> The truth is that [we only control a small minority of our thoughts](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-we-control-our-thoughts/).
> 
> Most of our thoughts are subconscious, meaning that they’re part of a constant background process of thinking. A small fraction of these slip into our conscious thinking, but we are unaware of the rest, and, thus, we don’t have the power to dismiss them.
> 
> Even actions that we believe we’ve actively chosen are executed largely by unconscious processes. For instance, we can choose to try to catch a football when it’s thrown to us, but the action of actually catching the football is something that the unconscious mind is more responsible for than the conscious one. This might be why we’re often surprised when our reflexes take over—like when your roommate unexpectedly tosses you the keys to the apartment and your hand snaps out to catch them.

The four myths work together to trap us in unhappiness: Since nobody talks about feeling bad (for fear that others will think there’s something wrong with them), we falsely believe that we’re _supposed_ to be happy, that everyone else is happy, and that we must learn to control our thoughts and feelings well enough to eliminate the negative ones—even though we can’t actually control them.
