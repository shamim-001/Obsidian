## Chapters 1-2: Reality, Illusion, and Dharma

The _Bhagavad Gita_ is one part of the _Mahabharata_, an ancient Sanskrit story that’s one of the oldest known epics. The _Gita_ is one of the most famous pieces of Hindu literature, and the lessons it teaches are central to that faith. As a cultural touchstone and a spiritual guide, scholars consider it one of the most important ancient texts in the world. The translation and commentary by Eknath Easwaran help even those who aren’t learned in Hindu mythology to understand its teachings.

As the _Bhagavad Gita_ begins, two mighty armies face each other across the field of Kurukshetra, which is located to the north of modern-day Delhi. **The _Pandavas_, led by Prince Arjuna, are about to wage war against their kin, the _Kauravas_, who have usurped the throne of Hastinapura.**

Arjuna is conflicted because he doesn’t want to fight against his own family. He turns to his childhood friend and charioteer Krishna, who is actually an incarnation of the god Vishnu, for advice.

Krishna’s advice comprises the vast majority of the _Gita_—“_Bhagavad Gita_” means “song of God.” He begins by discussing dharma, what we might call destiny, and tells Arjuna that it’s his dharma to fight. Krishna then moves into discussions of the difference between reality and illusion—anything that’s of the physical, temporary world isn’t real. The only reality is divinity, which Arjuna’s weapons can’t harm, so he should have no qualms about fighting.

From there, Krishna moves into a discussion of his own nature as God; how all things came from him and he exists in everything. He discusses how the path to enlightenment involves recognizing that truth and seeing that all things are connected through God. This leads to selfless action in the literal sense—acting without thought or care for oneself, focused only on God.

The ultimate goal of these lessons is to help Arjuna break free from samsara, the cycle of reincarnation. However, in the short term, they serve to soothe Arjuna’s doubts and ready him for the battle to come.

### The History Behind the Battle of Kurukshetra

There’s a great deal of history drawing these two armies to Kurukshetra.

A man named Pandu, of the Kuru dynasty, was the king of Hastinapura. While he ruled he shared power with his brother Dhritarashtra. However, Pandu died young, and Dhritarashtra was born blind, so he couldn’t be named king under the laws of Hastinapura.

Therefore, Pandu’s son Yudhishthira should have been the next king, but he was too young to take the throne. Dhritarashtra continued to rule in Yudhishthira’s stead until he became old enough to take the throne himself. However, when Yudhishthira came of age, Dhritarashtra began plotting for his own son Duryodhana to succeed him instead. That scheming led to the current conflict between the Pandavas, the supporters of Yudhishthira who call themselves the sons of Pandu; and the Kauravas, the supporters of Duryodhana and so-called sons of Kuru—though, in reality, both sides are part of the Kuru dynasty.

Before the battle begins, prince Duryodhana of the Kauravas studies the opposing army. He reports that there are many great heroes among the Pandavas, but that their own army has equally great men and is much larger. He ends with a call for his soldiers to stand firm and support Bhishma, the eldest of the Kurus and the leader of their army. Bhishma responds to this by blowing a conch horn—a call to arms, which is taken up by the rest of his army. The Pandava army responds with horns and drums of their own.

#### Sanjaya and Dhritarashtra

The _Bhagavad Gita_ is framed as a story-within-a-story. **Sanjaya, an advisor to king Dhritarashtra, is having a vision of the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna and telling the king what he sees.** This is possible because Sanjaya has been blessed with the gift of divine sight, so he’s able to see everything that happens at Kurukshetra as if he were there in person.

Dhritarashtra refers to Kurukshetra as the “field of _dharma_.” Dharma, which can be loosely translated as both duty and law, refers both to the cosmic rules of the universe and to people’s individual destinies. Calling Kurukshetra the field of dharma implies that what’s about to happen isn’t only a physical battle, but a spiritual struggle over what is right and just.

### Arjuna and Sri Krishna

Prince Arjuna leads the Pandavas’ army. His chariot is driven by Sri Krishna, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, who has taken a mortal form in the _Bhagavad Gita_. Krishna has been Arjuna’s friend and advisor throughout his life, but he can’t fight this battle. **Leading the army is Arjuna’s dharma—his duty and destiny.** Krishna is only there to support him.

(Shortform note: “Sri,” sometimes spelled “Shri,” is a term of respect that doesn’t have a direct translation.)

As Arjuna sees that the fighting’s about to start, he asks Krishna to drive his chariot in between the two armies so that he can take a closer look at his enemies. When he sees the people in the Kauravas’ army, he recognizes many of them as his own family and friends.

Arjuna is overcome with despair. He tells Krishna that he doesn’t want to fight against his own family, and that his family fighting within itself will lead to chaos in the kingdom. He also says that there are great heroes and respected scholars on the other side, and Arjuna questions how he could ever live with himself if he killed them in battle. Arjuna says that it would be better to lay down his weapons and let the Kauravas kill him.

**Krishna replies that, though Arjuna is speaking from the heart, he is also speaking from ignorance.** Although physical bodies can be destroyed, a person’s essence will be reborn again and again, unchanged, through the process of reincarnation. Therefore, Arjuna wouldn’t be killing anybody, and there would be no reason to grieve for them.

Krishna compares reincarnation to the changes that a person goes through over a single lifetime, from childhood to adulthood to old age. You wouldn’t say that a person became someone else after growing up, and in the same sense, you shouldn’t think of someone who’s been reincarnated as becoming a different person.

#### Only the Eternal Is Real

Krishna explains that temporary things shouldn’t be considered real. **Pain and pleasure, heat and cold, and even life and death are temporary.** Similarly, the temporary bodies of the men Arjuna will fight against aren’t real; their true selves are eternal and immutable, and change bodies as a living person changes clothes. Knowing that, Krishna asks rhetorically, how can Arjuna kill or be killed by them?

People who understand the difference between the real and the illusory will remain calm in any situation, unaffected by either hard times or good times. Such people have taken a key step toward breaking the cycle of reincarnation.

Even if Arjuna can’t currently separate his ideas of the temporary bodies from the true souls that inhabit them, Krishna points out that death and rebirth happen to everyone. These men will die whether or not Arjuna kills them, and there’s no point in mourning the inevitable.

#### Fulfilling Dharma

Next, Krishna reminds Arjuna of his dharma. He’s of the _kshatriya_ caste, a warrior and a leader, and therefore it’s his duty to fight in this battle. **He should be excited for the chance to wage war against evil, as there’s no higher calling for a kshatriya.** Fighting this battle will nearly guarantee Arjuna entrance to heaven while he waits for his next life.

On the other hand, if Arjuna refuses to fight, he’d be going against his dharma. Doing so would hurt his chances of reaching heaven and—possibly even worse for a kshatriya—disgrace him in life. Great heroes on both sides of the battle would think that Arjuna had withdrawn out of cowardice or weakness, and his reputation would be irreparably damaged.

(Hindu tradition divides people into four castes. Brahmins are the highest caste, the priests and spiritual leaders. Kshatriyas like Arjuna are just below them, the caste of warriors and rulers. Below that are the vaishyas, who are merchants and landowners. The lowest caste is the shudras, or servants, who do the bidding of all others.)

(Shortform note: Below even the shudras are the untouchables or outcastes, who do distasteful work such as street sweeping and latrine cleaning.)

### Yoga: Unite With God

Krishna now begins teaching Arjuna lessons about yoga. You may be familiar with one type of yoga, _hatha yoga_, which teaches control over one’s body and mind through physical exercise and meditation. **However, in a broader sense, yoga is any activity that brings a person closer to God.** In fact, the word yoga comes from _yuj_, meaning “to unite” (in this case, to unite with God).

Krishna explains that yoga is the way to break free from _karma_, the cosmic force that binds people to the cycle of rebirth. The definition of karma that you may be familiar with—being rewarded for good deeds and punished for bad ones—isn’t quite accurate. There _is_ an element of getting what you deserve, but karma is the force that binds people to the cycle of reincarnation and determines what they will be born as in each life. Each person has a “debt” of karma, which can be worked off through fulfilling dharma and selfless service. Once you’re completely freed from your karma, you’ll stop being reincarnated.

The key to practicing yoga is to recognize Krishna’s—and, by extension, Vishnu’s—presence in all things, and to devote every action to serving him. A person who does this fulfills his dharma with no sense of ego and no interest in rewards, nor fear of failure or punishment. **This is the attitude that Arjuna should adopt as he goes to war against the Kauravas—that he will do his duty as best he can, in God’s name, without worrying about the outcome.**

People who don’t follow yoga, who do things for their own pleasure or profit, are easily distracted and confused. They lose sight of their dharma, and are doomed to be caught in the cycle of _samsara_—reincarnation—forever.

Arjuna, who’s shown throughout the _Gita_ to be a practical person, and who is most interested in things he can put into practice, asks Krishna what people who have achieved this state of selflessness are like. How do they move, how do they speak? In other words, how could he recognize and emulate them?

Krishna answers that such people understand that everything is connected. Everything comes from and contains a part of Vishnu; therefore, true practitioners of yoga recognize themselves as one part of a much greater whole. **By letting go of concepts like “I” and “mine,” yogis can unite themselves fully with God.**

Since people can be tempted by physical objects and experiences—what Krishna calls “sense objects”—he explains that the truly wise can draw their senses inward at will. By focusing solely on Vishnu (remember that Krishna is Vishnu in a human body), they can block out external temptations and devote every moment to serving him. This frees them from physical attachments and keeps their minds clear.

Having let go of personal attachments, desires, and fears, yogis aren’t affected by good times or bad times. They want nothing, fear nothing, and are never roused to anger; they pass through life peacefully, no matter what may be happening around them. **Krishna advises Arjuna to aspire to be like them.**
