## Chapter 9: Principle 3—Greatness Is a Journey, Not a Destination

You can be great if you can be present in the moment. But you often have so many responsibilities, it’s hard to know where to put your energy and how to get the mental downtime you need to thrive. **You multitask to make sure you engage with everything you need to get done, but by engaging with everything, you aren’t truly engaging with anything.**

When you spread your attention too thin over multiple directions, you aren’t fully applying yourself to any task. You’re overworked, overconcerned, and overtired. Burnout is a likely result, and in the end, you haven’t mastered anything, just become mediocre at several things. To be truly great, you need to allow your body to catch up with your mind. When you're mentally in the same place as you are physically, you're living in the moment. And your true potential lies within this moment.

You can’t change the past or live in the future, but that doesn’t stop you from defining your worth by some end result you believe will signify success. **Greatness isn’t achieved when you reach your final destination. Greatness represents the efforts made along the journey to get there.** You become great the moment you decide to do the work to reach your goal, and the end result is merely a tangible marker of your greatness.

There’s a fine line between greatness and mediocrity when it comes to how you live your life. You maintain a mediocre level of achievement when you continue to do the same things over and over again day in and day out. You start to become great the moment you make a concerted effort to push past your normal routine and add value to your day.

- For instance, a salesperson who only meets her weekly quota is mediocre. A salesperson who commits to calling two or three extra people a day and spends a few extra hours each week refining her strategies is working with greatness. Those small changes will lead to significant results over time.

**You have the ability to be great, and you start by striving for more, creating a plan to achieve your goals, and being disciplined in your actions.** You can change your life by simply making the choice to start executing at a higher level. Don’t be content with the life you’re living. Strive for the life you’re capable of living for 12 weeks, and reap the rewards.

### The Fallacy of Work-Life Balance

Much of what challenges your ability to be present is your attempt to create a work-life balance. You struggle to find a balance between work, family, friends, community, health, and personal time, so you decide to give equal time and energy to each avenue of your life. But when you do this, you overextend yourself and become frustrated and joyless. The problem is that success cannot be achieved by balancing your time in each area of life. **Success happens when you intentionally create an imbalance in how you spend your energy.**

Different moments in life will require different amounts of energy, and there’s nothing wrong with that. The purpose of intentional imbalance is to put your energy where you want it to go, rather than feeling like you have to dole it out evenly.

The 12-week year is a process that helps you intentionally put your energy in one or two areas at a time. When you focus on a few key aspects of your life for 12 weeks, you’re able to remain present with your focus and make great strides in that area.

- For example, if you decide to use the 12-week year to improve your health, you could do one of two things. You could create a fitness plan that features exercise, better eating habits, and weight training and follow that plan weekly, or you could focus on one part of your health, such as improving your diet, and create a plan for maximizing that aspect first.

It’s up to you to decide how to divide your focused energy. Sometimes a full plan will be best, and sometimes a focused activity is better to optimize first. Either plan works if you commit to the necessary actions, but you’ll need to accept that your ultimate goal is not going to be reached in one 12-week period. **Each 12-week period will improve one aspect of your plan so you can eventually achieve the immense overall result.** Let’s look at another example to help cement this concept:

- You want to run a marathon, so you develop a workout routine that will increase over 12 weeks. Your routine involves 10 minutes of running, 10 minutes of weights, and a low-calorie meal two nights a week. As you continue to succeed in executing this plan, you raise the fitness elements to 20 minutes and eat three healthy dinners a week. You continue this cycle of incremental increases for the remainder of the 12 weeks, and by the end, you're in better shape and have a better foundation from which to accomplish the next best strategy for the next 12 weeks. When all of these 12-week cycles are complete, you’re ready for your marathon.

The secret to maintaining success over each 12-week period is to celebrate the victories along the way. You’ll be more confident and satisfied the more you acknowledge your progress, which is the underlying magic of the 12-week year. **You no longer have to wait until the end of the year to feel good about your work because you’ll generate growth and successes every three months.** Use that success to strengthen your belief in yourself and resolve to continue reaching great heights.

#### How Do You Choose What to Improve?

Look at the seven arenas of spirituality, relationships, family, community, health, private life, and professional life, and rate each one on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being “complete satisfaction” with where you currently are. Focus your energy on whichever arena receives a low score to start the process of improvement.
