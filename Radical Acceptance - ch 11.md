## Chapter 11: Practicing Mindful Relationships

Chapter 10 spoke about Radical Acceptance of others in fairly general terms. Now we’ll discuss specific ways to practice Radical Acceptance in our relationships with other people. This is a crucial step in spiritual growth—although spirituality is a deeply personal journey, humans are social beings by nature.

A lot of the pains and fears we carry are the results of our relationships with other people. **Therefore, we can’t truly heal while isolating ourselves.** Community is a powerful and necessary force, and Radical Acceptance can help us to fully engage with it just as it helps us engage with our own inner lives.

### Radical Acceptance in Relationships

Much of what we’ve discussed so far has been focused on ourselves as individuals: personal meditations, personal growth, and so on. However, humans are social creatures, and our spiritual journey can’t happen in isolation—a great deal of our pain comes from our relationships with each other, and it can only be healed through relationships.

When we have awareness and compassion in our relationships—in other words, when we approach them with Radical Acceptance—they can be powerful tools for spiritual growth and healing.

Note that ”relationships” here doesn’t just mean romantic relationships. We have relationships with everyone we interact with: family, friends, teachers, colleagues, and so on.

We’ve discussed how practicing Radical Acceptance for ourselves teaches us that our own suffering isn’t wrong, and pain doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with us. **We can get that same message from others, and give it back to them.** Giving Radical Acceptance to others reminds them that they are inherently good and worthy of love. When we practice Radical Acceptance of others, and they practice Radical Acceptance of us, we can find wells of confidence and strength we never knew that we had.

For an example of what this strength can do, Radical Acceptance is the key to interventions for alcoholics or drug addicts. An intervention isn’t about confronting or attacking the addict. Instead, the key is to let the addict see and hear the people who love him in spite of the harm he’d caused to himself and others.

**Communities have strength that individuals lack.**

#### The Importance of Community

The Buddha called _sangha_—community—a treasure of the spiritual path. Indeed, sangha’s benefits are exemplified by the Buddha’s relationship with his cousin Ananda. Ananda saw to the Buddha’s material needs, and the Buddha offered Ananda unwavering spiritual guidance. Each supported the other and provided what he needed.

**Opening our hearts to others can be a gift to them, as well as to us—it might make them feel welcome to do the same.** For example, someone who’s nervous about performing in a show might share that feeling with their fellow performers. In doing so, not only is that person addressing her own fear, she’s opening the door for other people to share their own discomfort and offer mutual support.

Exposing our vulnerabilities in this way is always a risk, but we’ll suffer much worse pain if we keep ourselves isolated from one another.

A more extreme example of this practice is the healing ritual of a Zambian tribe. When a member of the tribe is suffering (physically or emotionally), the entire tribe comes together to perform the ritual. It begins when the one who’s suffering admits to whatever truths he or she has been keeping hidden: These could be things like secret grudges, hatred, or lust for other members of the tribe.

However, the ritual isn’t complete until _every_ member of the tribe shares their own hidden truths. The ritual is based on the understanding that we’re all connected—one person’s suffering is everybody’s suffering, and therefore everybody must participate in the healing process.

Remember that one of the keys to Radical Acceptance is accepting pain for what it is, rather than taking it personally or thinking that it reflects on us as people. However, there will be times when someone’s pain is too great to face alone or it is something that he or she is unable to practice Radical Acceptance on. In times like that, sangha—community—is a powerful resource. **When one person’s pain becomes the community’s shared suffering, we can also share our strength to cope with it.**

The monk Thich Nhat Hanh once said that, in the West, Buddha is found in sangha. He meant that, because we have such a tendency to view ourselves as isolated individuals, devoting ourselves to each other instead is an especially powerful way for us to grow spiritually.
