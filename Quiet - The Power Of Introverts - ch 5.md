## Chapter 5: Changing Your Temperament

Further research by Dr. Carl Schwartz at Massachusetts General Hospital on Kagan’s subjects as teenagers showed that **we can stretch beyond our inherited characteristics, but only to a point**. **Our temperaments continue to influence us throughout our lives**.

Schwartz used an fMRI machine that measures brain activity. He showed participants a fast-moving series of photos of people’s faces to simulate the experience of walking into a crowded room. Some of the photos were repeated and became “familiar,” while new ones were continually added to the sequence. The people who had been highly reactive as children were more sensitive—they reacted more strongly—to the photos of unfamiliar faces.

Some of the high-reactives had grown into socially engaged and friendly teenagers who were not outwardly bothered by new experiences, but their brains still reacted more strongly to the unfamiliar faces.

**Our personalities are somewhat like rubber bands, able to stretch but only so far.** Introvert Bill Gates can hone his social skills but he’ll never be as gregarious as Bill Clinton—and Clinton will never be a solitary computer genius like Gates.

### Stretching Yourself

When the emotional center of our brain—the amygdala—reacts with anxiety to a situation, another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, can send a counter-message to calm down.

Thus, we can teach ourselves to react differently, although we may revert to our old reactions under stress.

**Both introverts and extroverts can stretch beyond their comfort zones when it’s to their advantage, particularly to further a career.** For example, an introvert can learn and practice skills to be more comfortable interacting socially, while an extrovert can learn to slow down and be more reflective by cultivating friendships with introverts.

As an introvert, author Susan Cain struggled with public speaking, yet it was something her work often required her to do. To make the experience less stressful, she took a class in public speaking and also taught herself a number of stress-reduction techniques, such as:

- Treating every speech as a creative project and enjoying the research and preparation, which carries over into the presentation itself.
- Speaking on subjects she’s passionate about, which enables her to focus on the topic more than on the audience. Also, since she’s interested in the topic, she doesn’t have to project enthusiasm she doesn’t feel.

### Learning Your Comfort Zone

Even though you can stretch your temperament, you can often be more effective by working within your comfort zone as much as possible.

**Your comfort level in any environment depends on the level of stimulation you receive.** Stimulation is the amount of input you receive from the world around you. If you’re an extrovert you thrive on a lot of stimulation, while if you’re an introvert you want much less.

In the 1960s, research psychologist Hans Eysenck identified this difference between introverts and extroverts. In one experiment, he placed lemon juice on people’s tongues and found that introverts salivated more—they reacted more strongly to the sensory stimulation. Another study in which people were asked to play a word game while wearing noise-emitting headphones found that more noise (a form of stimulation) hindered the introverts’ performance, while too little noise had the same effect on the extroverts’ performance.

Eysenck theorized that we all seek a level of stimulation that’s “just right” for us, neither too much nor too little. Thus, introverts prefer shutting their office doors and delving into projects alone—they find mental activity stimulating, while feeling distracted by external stimulation like noise and interruptions by colleagues. On the other hand, extroverts seek interaction through group activities and meetings.

Once you understand your preference levels for stimulation, you can seek out environments that work best for you or try to tailor your environment—in other words, **look for your “sweet spot” where you’re optimally stimulated**.

People already do this to an extent in their personal lives. For instance, an introvert may spend much of a weekend at home reading, then realize she’s starting to feel understimulated and call a friend to go out for lunch. However, that experience can turn to overstimulation if other friends join them.

**You can manage your stimulation level so you spend as much time as possible in your sweet spot by the way you organize your home life, relationships, hobbies, and social life.** This can apply to your professional life as well.

For example, a tax lawyer named Esther was an introvert who enjoyed solitary legal research, however her legal group periodically had to give public presentations. Extroverted colleagues were comfortable “winging it” and expected Esther to do the same. However, she wasn’t effective at speaking off the cuff. Her solution was to insist on advance notice from her colleagues, which gave her time to prepare for her speeches, allowing her to deliver them from within her comfort zone.
