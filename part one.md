I reside in a small apartment in Dhaka as I cannot afford a spacious house. Despite its size limitations, the apartment offers several advantages.

Additionally, apartments require less maintenance, suiting the lifestyle of busy individuals. Overall, I genuinely appreciate my living situation.

The bedrooms serve as private and snug sanctuaries, providing each family member with a space for relaxation and solace. The kitchen, though small, is well-equipped for meal preparation.

In my apartment, I reside with my family, cherishing the advantages of communal living. This arrangement cultivates a strong sense of unity and provides a supportive atmosphere. Sharing the responsibilities and enjoying quality time together are among the many benefits we appreciate.
