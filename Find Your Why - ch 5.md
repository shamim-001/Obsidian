# Find Your Why

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Chapter 5: Conducting a Purpose Discussion

The previous chapter detailed how to prepare for a purpose discussion. We’ll now explore how to conduct it. The core of the discussion process is sharing stories or experiences and mining them for insights about your purpose. (Shortform note: Your stories will be most useful if you talk to the people involved in them before the purpose discussion takes place. Research shows that we don’t remember our past very well on our own. Rather, [we rely on others to fill in the details we’ve missed or decided to forget](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mental-mishaps/202104/who-tells-your-story-how-we-remember-hamilton-and-ourselves#:~:text=important%20for%20our%20personal%20memories,reconstruct%20our%20memories%20and%20our).)

While the goal of a purpose discussion is the same for both individuals and teams, the process for each is different. Therefore, in this chapter, we’ll first explain the process for individuals and then explore how finding your purpose works for teams.

### The Purpose Discussion for Individuals

Sinek outlines three stages of the purpose discussion for individuals: telling your stories, identifying your themes, and drafting your purpose statement.

#### Stage 1: Tell Your Stories

To begin, share the stories you came up with with your partner. While you share, they should do two things:

- **Take notes on the main ideas** and feelings behind the stories, and capture: 1) the core action you took, and 2) the effect you had or aimed for.
- **Highlight recurring words or concepts.** Sinek emphasizes that these are the themes you’ll use in the next steps.

> **How to Get to the Core of a Story**
> 
> As a partner, how can you determine which ideas and recurring concepts you should make note of? Here are four steps for [getting to the core of a story and understanding what it's really about](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-other-side-relationships/202109/deep-listening-the-heart-the-story):
> 
> - Identify the facts of the story.
>     
> - Identify the emotions behind the story through the other person’s words and body language.
>     
> - Ask yourself what the story is really about. Stay silent as you observe what ideas and emotions come up.
>     
> - Once you’ve identified an emotion or idea, share it with them to see if it resonates. If it does, continue asking questions about it to see what else they can uncover. If it doesn’t, repeat the process to explore other possibilities.
>     

#### Stage 2: Identify Your Themes

Now, have your partner look through their notes and identify _themes_. According to the authors, themes are ideas that come up in at least two stories.

Together, read through the list of themes and identify the _two_ you feel a stronger connection to and that convey:

1. **Your unique participation in the stories**—the action you took
2. **Your effect on others**—how they benefited from your participation

Put the other themes aside. You’ll come back to them later when you determine your How.

(Shortform note: Like many people, you might be telling your stories with some responsibility bias, causing you to overemphasize your role and your effect on others. Adam Grant explains in _[Give and Take](https://shortform.com/app/book/give-and-take/1-page-summary)_ that responsibility bias results from ego and from [having more information about the actions you’ve taken versus the contributions other people have made](https://shortform.com/app/book/give-and-take/chapter-3#why-takers-act-poorly). Your partner can help you avoid this bias by asking you about the contributions of other people involved in the stories you’re telling.)

#### Stage 3: Draft Your Purpose Statement

At this stage, Sinek recommends that you and your partner each write a draft of your purpose statement separately. Using the two themes selected in the previous step. First, write **the core action** your purpose compels you to take. Then, write **the ultimate impact** you want that action to have.

For example: “To tell necessary stories (action) so that hurt people can heal (impact),” or “To build strong foundations (action) so that future generations can thrive (impact).”

The authors caution against spending too much time writing—just capture what _feels right_ at a visceral level.

Share your drafts with each other. Decide whether to keep one or combine them. Once your draft has the right ideas, leave it for a while. Come back to it later with a fresh eye, and rework the phrasing until you feel it captures your essence.

(Shortform note: If you don’t have a partner with whom you can draft your purpose statement, consider writing a personal mission statement. This process also arrives at a succinct expression of your impact and core action [without needing to collaborate with a partner](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/202106/how-write-personal-mission-statement). In addition, the personal mission statement process allows for changes and revisions in a way that is more flexible than Sinek’s process, because you’re meant to revise and improve it throughout your lifetime.)

### The Purpose Discussion for Teams

The process of finding your purpose for teams is longer than the individual process. It comprises four stages: opening the discussion, mining team members’ stories, drafting the purpose statement, and closing the discussion.

#### Stage 1: Open the Discussion

Sinek suggests starting by sharing an example of an organization that has a clear purpose, or Why. That will introduce participants to the theory and show them what they can expect from the discussion.

Then, ask people to pair up and **discuss what motivates them about the team**. For example, you might ask questions like, “When you first joined, what about the team resonated with you?” and “What continues to resonate with you and motivate you today?”

Next, show the video of Sinek’s [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4) about purpose, and ensure participants understand his basic ideas.

(Shortform note: Having team members start by discussing their motivations can create connection because it [encourages genuine interactions where peers can listen and affirm each other’s experiences](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/fostering_high_quality_connections).)

#### Stage 2: Mine Their Stories

The goal in this stage is to extract **two key insights** from stories participants will share in groups: **the core action the team consistently takes, and the effect the action has on others.**

To do so, the authors suggest dividing participants into groups that reflect the diversity in the room. Avoid teaming people up with the colleagues they work with every day. (Shortform note: As David Epstein argues in _[Range](https://shortform.com/app/book/range),_ people from diverse backgrounds bring different ideas and values to the table, which [results in new insights](https://shortform.com/app/book/range/part-3-3#team-diversity-enables-innovation). Interestingly, he also advocates striving for diversity in ideals: He contends that an organization with [diverse ideals can be more effective than one in which everyone coalesces around a single vision](https://shortform.com/app/book/range/part-3-3#the-benefits-of-balanced-ideals), in contrast to Sinek’s belief that everyone in the organization should align with the same purpose.)

To extract the first insight—the core actions the team consistently takes—the facilitator should begin by asking participants to **share with their small groups stories of when they took pride in being part of the team**. Then, ask each small group to share their three most emotionally impactful stories with the rest of the team. **Ask follow-up questions** after each story to uncover its significance. For instance, you might ask, “What feelings did that moment stir up in you?” “What did you learn from that experience, and how has that shaped you?” or “What made you decide to share that story today?”

Ask participants to **choose an _action verb or phrase_ for each story** they have shared. The verbs should capture the _core actions_ the team took. Finally, ask each group to share what they’ve written while you take notes, highlighting phrases or expressions that come up more than once.

> **Troubleshooting for Facilitators**
> 
> The process of finding your purpose for teams is complex, and problems can arise. Facilitators can be most effective by keeping these suggestions in mind:
> 
> If a team is struggling to come up with examples, help reframe their thoughts by considering proud moments that may be overlooked. In _[The Power of Moments](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments)_, Chip and Dan Heath suggest paying attention to [small wins](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-7-9#strategy-1-create-and-celebrate-small-wins) and [milestones that usually go uncelebrated](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-7-9#create-meaningful-milestones-for-your-organization), as well as [focusing on progress instead of results](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-7-9#strategy-2-recognize-efforts-and-notice-progress).
> 
> To come up with good follow-up questions, [there are strategies facilitators can apply](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/202102/the-art-asking-questions#:~:text=asking%20probing%20questions%20with%20making,response%20to%20listening%20to%20what%20the). The most important strategy is to listen while people talk rather than plan what you’re going to say next. Also, there are some easy but meaningful follow-up questions to keep in mind, including asking for examples, raising counterpoints, and simply asking people to tell you more.
> 
> If the team isn't sure how to translate stories into action verbs or phrases, remind them of another process in which they use verbs and phrases to solidify ideas: writing objectives in action-oriented language. The logic behind both processes is the same. Attaching action words to stories makes the stories more concrete—similar to how action verbs [help make objectives actionable](https://shortform.com/app/book/measure-what-matters/part-1-chapters-1-3#objectives), as John Doerr instructs in _[Measure What Matters](https://shortform.com/app/book/measure-what-matters)_.

To extract the second insight—the _key positive effect_ the team has on others—ask small groups to **share stories of people whose lives changed for the better, thanks to the team**. Then, ask each group to share their responses while you write down a phrase from each response that captures the essence of the team’s effect on others, and note repeated phrases.

(Shortform note: Since the authors encourage participants to focus on the feelings the team generates, rather than the product or services they provide, this could unintentionally make an organization [seem more virtuous than it is](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-savvy-consumer/202109/beware-green-woke-and-corporate-purpose-washing#:~:text=their%20word%20for%20it.%20Look%20at%20what%20the,money%20to%20community%20organizations). Since customers are savvy—and as Sinek argues in _[Start With Why](https://shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why),_ [they can detect manipulation](https://shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why/chapter-2)—you shouldn’t overlook your business model and the less sanitized parts of the work you do. This will help make your purpose statement meaningful and truthful.)

#### Stage 3: Draft the Purpose Statement

The third stage is to **write the first draft of a purpose statement**. Sinek emphasizes that the statement should be actionable and resonate with the team, but the wording doesn’t need to be perfect.

To begin, the facilitator should show participants a sample purpose statement and explain where each part of the statement will come from: The team’s core actions will shape the first part of the statement; the team’s effects on others will shape the second part.

Ask small groups to draft a purpose statement using the notes from the previous conversations, particularly the repeated phrases and ideas. Each small group should do their own draft. Finally, ask small groups to share their drafts out loud so that all the participants together can decide whether to keep one of the drafts or combine them. For example, two small groups could come up with these purpose statements for a financial services institution: 1) “Empower customers to secure their financial goals,” and 2) “Give people the tools they need to build their financial futures.” The full group might then combine the statements as follows: “Empower customers to secure their financial futures.”

Save all the notes you didn’t use in the final draft of the purpose statement. These are the themes you will use to determine your How.

> **Steps for Effective Collaboration**
> 
> To help the team [collaborate effectively](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor#promoting-effective-collaboration-with-radical-candor), facilitators might want to frame the process using the steps Kim Scott outlines in _[Radical Candor](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor/1-page-summary)_:
> 
> - Listening. Make sure [everyone listens to each other and encourage them to build on each others’ ideas](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor#listening).
>     
> - Clarifying. Help small groups refine their ideas before sharing them with the rest of the participants. If you catch something that’s unclear, encourage them to revise it before presenting it [so others will assess their ideas fairly](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor#clarifying).
>     
> - Debating. Encourage respectful debating in the small groups and in the larger group. You can do this by [stopping a conversation if it becomes about “winning” rather than exchanging ideas, or if people seem to get tired of the discussion](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor#debating).
>     
> - Deciding. After some debate, [transition to decision-making](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor#deciding). Remember to leave the decision in the participants’ hands—the facilitator guides but doesn’t participate in the choice.
>     

#### Stage 4: Close the Discussion

To close, Sinek suggests the facilitator ask the team for volunteers to **keep refining the phrasing** of the purpose statement. Then, suggest ways **the team can start living their purpose,** including the following:

- Highlight instances when people act in alignment with the team’s purpose, and point out how their outcomes align with the purpose.
- Use the purpose statement as guidance when making important decisions.
- Discover their personal purpose, and reflect on how it aligns with the work they do as part of the team.

> **More Ways to Live Your Organization’s Purpose**
> 
> In _[The Culture Code](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-culture-code)_, Daniel Coyle outlines ways leaders can develop purpose in the workplace that complement the steps in _Find Your Why_:
> 
> Communicate priorities to empower team members. When leaders clearly communicate the purpose and let everyone know that it’s the top priority, team members are [better equipped to make decisions and assess the What, or outcomes.](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-culture-code/chapter-17#priorities)
> 
> Incentivize behavior through [high and consistent standards](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-culture-code/chapter-17#leadership). As Sinek suggests, you can do that by praising behavior that aligns with the team’s Why and encouraging members to find their personal purpose so they internalize the importance of being in alignment with their Why.
> 
> Use a shared language, like a memorable motto, [to remind members of the team’s values and practices](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-culture-code/chapter-17#signals-of-purpose). As you refine the purpose statement, take the opportunity to make it catchy enough that team members can use as a motto.
