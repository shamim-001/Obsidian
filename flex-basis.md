- Specify the initial size of a flex item **along the main axis** before any remaining space is distributed. Main axis depends on flex-direction. If flex-direction: row, main axis is row. On the other hand, if flex-direction: column, main axis is column.
- The default value: "auto," which means the initial size of the flex item is determined by its content.
