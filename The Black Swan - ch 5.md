## Chapter 5: Why We Can’t Know What We’ll Know

Epistemic arrogance, the pretensions of “experts,” our ever-increasing access to information—all belie an incontrovertible fact: **In many, perhaps even most, areas of our lives, prediction is simply impossible**.

Take discoveries, for example. At any given moment, there are scores of scientists, scholars, researchers, and inventors around the world working diligently to better our lives and increase our knowledge. But what often goes unremarked is that **the discoveries with the profoundest impact on our lives are inadvertent**—**_random—_rather than the reward for careful and painstaking work**.

The discovery of penicillin is a case in point. Biologist Alexander Fleming left a stack of cultures sitting out in his laboratory while he went on vacation, and when he returned, a bacteria-killing mold had formed on one of the cultures. _Voila_!—the world’s first antibiotic.

The same goes for the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, the omnipresent radiation in space that provides a key piece of evidence for the Big Bang. No researcher had any idea it existed until two radio astronomers noticed a hiss in their listening devices. How unexpected was their discovery? At first, the astronomers thought the hiss was caused by pigeon droppings on their antenna!

**Because earth-shattering discoveries are unexpected or inadvertent, their importance, at least in the beginning, often goes unrecognized.** When Darwin presented his findings at the Linnean Society, the 19th-century’s preeminent institution of natural history, its president dismissed the theory as “no striking discovery.”

### The Scientific Grounds for Uncertainty

The innovator of the scientific method of “falsification,” Karl Popper, also proposed an influential theory of history. The theory held that, because technological advance was “fundamentally unpredictable,” so too was the course of history.

Popper’s theory is echoed by a key law in statistics called “the law of iterated expectations.” The law describes a situation **when to predict something means to _already_ _know_ that something**.

Think, for example, of the invention of the wheel. If a primitive human were to _predict_ the invention of the wheel, that human would _already know enough_ about the wheel to invent it him- or herself.

The same condition applies to _contemporary_ predictions of discoveries. For example, some have predicted that carbon-capture technology will solve global warming. But to make that prediction, one has to know the specifications of that technology—that is, one _has to know already_ how to create it (and thus how to stop global warming _now_). In other words, **if we don’t know _exactly how_ a certain technology will be created, we can’t make the prediction that the technology _will be_ created**.

#### Poincaré’s Nonlinearities

Henry Poincaré, arguably the most highly regarded mathematician of the late 19th-century in France, contributed to the theory of unpredictability by proposing the existence of _nonlinearities_—small phenomena that, as time goes on, can have profound consequences.

A seminal illustration of the concept is the “three-body problem.” In a planetary system consisting of two planets (bodies), predictions about those planets’ motion are easy to make: One need only account for the relation between the planets. But if a _third_ body enters the equation—perhaps a comet, passing between the two planets—the relation changes. Although the comet’s effects may not be visible at first, the tiny forces it has exerted on the planets will compound with each cycle of the system, potentially resulting in massive changes.

Another example of nonlinearities is the so-called “butterfly effect.” In the 1960s, a meteorologist at MIT modeling weather patterns discovered that a minuscule rounding change in his input parameters resulted in tremendously different weather events. Thus the concept that **a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world can cause a hurricane in another**.

Each of these examples illustrates the difficulty of making accurate predictions in a “dynamical system,” wherein there are multiple variables and even slight changes can drastically alter results. **When it comes to dynamical systems, Poincaré noted that the properties of the system can be observed and discussed, but there’s no way to compute—to use _numbers—_to describe the system**.

Suffice it to say, there is no more dynamical system than human society—Extremistan.

#### Hayek’s Libertarianism

One of very few esteemed economists (he won a Nobel in 1974) to understand the futility of prediction, Fredrich Hayek spent much of his career railing against the main feature of socialism, central planning.

In a classical socialist society, all economic decisions—allocation of resources, setting of prices, etc.—are made by a single entity. **Hayek believed that a dynamical system like the economy was simply too complex for a single entity to master**.

Hayek attributed notions of central planning to misguided “experts” (_nerds_, in Taleb’s terminology) who applied the methods of the physical sciences to social matters. Hayek recognized a stark distinction between soft sciences like economics and hard sciences like physics.

Hayek’s skepticism regarding any entity’s ability to predict the functioning of the economy led him to advocate for an “a-Platonic” approach, one that is open-minded and proceeds from the bottom up rather than the top down. He argued that **a libertarian system, wherein individuals are able to pursue their self-interest with a minimum of direction from above, is the best way to manage uncertainty**. In a system like this, he believed, the _system itself_ would react accordingly to any unexpected changes in, say, the food or credit supply.

Hayek’s anti-Platonifying approach to economics also puts his thought at odds with contemporary mainstream economists’.

For example, most economists today subscribe to some version of rational choice theory, which holds that individuals (or “agents”), when faced with an economic choice, will choose the option that maximizes their economic benefit. (A basic illustration: If an economic agent has a choice between an investment that returns $2 and one that returns $5, the agent will always choose the one that returns $5.) The assumption that agents will always act rationally when it comes to economic choices allows economists to create models and propose predictions for future economic behavior.

The problem with rational choice theory, however, is that it’s demonstrably _false_: **Empirical psychologists have shown that, in all sorts of economic situations, given various factors, individuals will act contradictorily and irrationally—they make the “wrong” choice**.

The upshot is that there is _no such thing_ as a **“general theory” of the economy, thus economic prediction is impossible.**

#### Forget Heisenberg

When discussing uncertainty, experts will frequently invoke physicist Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. In its specific application, the uncertainty principle holds that the more precisely one measures the position of a given particle, the less precisely one can measure its momentum, and vice versa.

The problem with this analogy is that subatomic uncertainty actually hails from Mediocristan—particles’ deviations from their expected positions or momentums can be graphed using a bell curve, and the sheer number and tininess of particles in existence mean those mild deviations average out.

**Real uncertainty arises in the real world**—like, for example, when Taleb can’t reach his ancestral village in Lebanon from New York because Israel is battling Hezbollah.

### Why Plan?

If prediction is impossible, and any human attempt to predict is ultimately futile, why do we continue to make forecasts or plans for the future?

First, it’s important to note that **there _are_ some areas of human experience where prediction is more viable than others**. For example, the physical sciences have an enviable track record in terms of predicting phenomena, from the subatomic to the cosmic.

But second, there is evidence that humans are _biologically conditioned_ to anticipate. In fact, it’s possible that our ability to imagine future consequences from present actions—an essential benefit of having _consciousness_—is the evolutionary advantage that allowed us to develop into the earth’s most advanced species.

This advantage only serves us so far, however. In terms of avoiding immediate harm, our capacity for anticipation is essential. But when we try to anticipate the long-term workings of dynamical systems, we inevitably get ourselves into trouble.
