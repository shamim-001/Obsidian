## Part 2: Maintaining Success

In this section, we’ll take a look at how Holiday advises you to act after you’ve attained success. Holiday notes that although a person might suppress her ego effectively while rising to success, once she’s attained it, her ego might take over. When she’s at the top, she becomes aware of her importance, her ego swells, and she starts behaving poorly. A person who loses control of her ego will most likely lose the success she’s achieved. The following sections explore different ways this can happen, and how you can resist that fate.

### Stay a Lifelong Student

In Part I, Holiday discussed the importance of becoming a lifelong student. Here, he discusses how important it is that you _maintain_ that openness to learning. While striving for success, you might absorb whatever knowledge and lessons you can, but once you’re successful, you might start thinking you know everything. If so, you’ll likely ignore new information and consequently blind yourself to challenges, threats, and points of weakness.

Further, **when you’ve achieved a measure of success, you’ll have different challenges than you had when you were seeking success, and you’ll need a different set of skills and knowledge.** You need to learn new lessons to sustain your success or to bring it to the next level. For example, a salesperson promoted to manager must now learn to oversee other salespeople. A chef opening her own restaurant must now learn to run both food production and customer service.

> **New Learning Opportunities Keep You Relevant**
> 
> Many management experts have noted the importance of seeking out new challenges and learning opportunities as you move through your career. This means actively pushing yourself outside your comfort zone even if you’ve reached a place of comfort where you feel like you’ve mastered your skills and are on top of your game. Experts advise that this is necessary because if you don’t constantly evolve, the world will move on without you.
> 
> Simon Sinek discusses this idea in his book _[The Infinite Game](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-infinite-game/guideline-4)_, where he advises that leaders with longevity are the ones who pursue new challenges even when they’re comfortably successful. For example, Nintendo originally found great success as a trading-card company, becoming one of the most profitable firms in Japan by the mid-20th century. The company could have continued to enjoy its position of power within its industry, but its president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, decided that it would have a stronger and longer-lasting profile if it took on new challenges. He thus steered the company towards toy-making and eventually, video games. If his ego had prompted him to just be happy with the success he’d already earned, he would have missed out on the opportunities of a changing world and Nintendo wouldn’t have become the iconic company it is today.

To illustrate how learning can help you maintain success, Holiday discusses the military successes of Genghis Khan, who sustained his empire by absorbing the technologies, political systems, arts, and innovations of each culture he invaded. His Mongol army valued learning so much that it traveled with translators and demanded to consult with doctors, astrologers, scribes, and advisers in each land it conquered. This allowed the army to, for example, adopt Turkish military strategies and Chinese technology for breaching walled cities. Further, Khan worked with royal families of conquered lands to maintain control where no other dynasties could. In doing so, he fused influences from all parts of the world and ended up with long-lasting influence on cultures, technologies, and political systems.

> **The Paradox of Genghis Khan’s Ego**
> 
> By holding up Genghis Khan as an example of someone who gained success by controlling his ego, Holiday inadvertently points to a weakness in his own argument. Few people would argue that Khan lacked ego—historians estimate that he was responsible for the murder of around 40 million people, or 11% of the world’s population at the time, and a 2003 chromosome study found that [around 1 in 200 men today is a descendent of Genghis Khan](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/1-in-200-men-direct-descendants-of-genghis-khan), indicating he engaged in widespread and frequent rape.
> 
> However, that ego didn’t stop him from becoming one of the most successful leaders in history whose influence is still felt in political systems and cultural profiles.
> 
> Holiday doesn’t address the more undesirable aspects of Genghis Khan’s ego, but instead focuses on the fact that he was willing to learn from others, arguing that this was the key to his great success.
> 
> While his openness to learning certainly helped his success, the discussion raises the question of whether or not Holiday’s theories can be adopted piecemeal—that is, can a person maintain success by embracing ego in some areas while controlling it in others? For example, can you embrace ego if it drives you to crush your opponents, as long as you suppress the ego that tells you to ignore advice?
> 
> By focusing on leaders whose humility is questionable, Holiday seems to allow for the existence of ego as long as it doesn’t interfere with your progress, as if there are two kinds of ego: that which interferes with success (bad ego) and that which fuels success (good ego).

### Don’t Lose Sight of Your Priorities

Holiday warns that when you become successful, you may be presented with opportunities that were unavailable to you previously—ones that promise _additional_ greatness in _different_ ways. For example, a famous actor might have the opportunity to open a themed restaurant, promising culinary fame as well as theatrical fame.

Holiday cautions that when your ego tells you that you can have it all, it drives you to say yes to a hodge-podge of offers, each of which aspires to a different goal or priority. Unfortunately, if you start to pursue all these options, you end up spreading your energy and resources thinly, and you are less likely to accomplish _any_ of your goals.

For example, many celebrities who’ve tried to cash in on their fame with a restaurant have failed. The restaurant business requires a completely different skill set than the movie or music industry, and celebrities such as Brittney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Steven Speilberg, Stephen and William Baldwin, and many others have each been forced to close floundering eateries after finding that their fame didn’t translate into culinary success.

Holiday advises that instead of giving in to the temptation to chase fame, money, or other forms of success offered to you, you should keep an eye on what success means to you personally and remember why you started your career in the first place. In other words, stay focused on your true priorities.

Thus, when offered a new opportunity:

- Ask yourself if this opportunity will divert your focus from your most important goals—will it monopolize your time, energy, and money so that your existing goals suffer?
- Ask yourself if it will, in fact, _compete_ with your existing goals—some goals are inherently at odds with one another, so that when you aim for one you can’t have the other. For example, imagine you rose to fame as a low-carb, vegan, health-food blogger; if you now decide to open an old-school donut shop, you might dilute your brand and harm your credibility.

> **Narrow Your Focus to Stay on Track**
> 
> Many management experts agree with Holiday’s advice to limit the number and types of goals you strive for. In his book _[Good Strategy Bad Strategy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/good-strategy-bad-strategy)_, Richard Rumelt discusses the importance of [narrowing your focus](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/good-strategy-bad-strategy/chapter-5), arguing that when you try to achieve several, disparate goals, you divert your resources from your most critical goal and decrease the likelihood of success in any area.
> 
> Rumelt’s theories are aimed at corporations, and he advises that they narrow their goals in two ways:
> 
> - Narrow their _external_ goals: Focus exclusively on one or two ultimate goals.
>     
> - Narrow their _internal_ goals: Eliminate policies and objectives that don’t support their ultimate, external goal.
>     
> 
> When we apply this advice to an individual rather than a corporation, it broadens Holiday’s advice of how to keep sight of your priorities:
> 
> - Narrow your external goals: Focus exclusively on the one or two objectives that are most important to you.
>     
> - Narrow your internal goals: Manage your time, effort, and money efficiently, eliminating tasks and projects that distract you from your ultimate, external goal.
>     
> 
> In this way, you can align your internal priorities with your external ones, and lessen the chances that you’ll get distracted from your most important goal.
> 
> **However, Don’t Habitually Ignore Opportunities**
> 
> On the other end of the spectrum, if you routinely ignore opportunities outside of your comfort zone, you might end up locked into a narrow path and deprive yourself of growth. This means you must strike a balance between Holiday’s advice to continually learn new things and his advice to not lose sight of your priorities.
> 
> Clay Christensen discusses responding to new opportunities in his book _[How Will You Measure Your Life?](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-will-you-measure-your-life/part-1-chapter-1)_ He notes that _anticipated opportunities_ are ones you set out to purposefully pursue, but _unanticipated opportunities_ are ones that pop up as you implement your deliberate plan. Sometimes unanticipated opportunities compete too strongly for resources and will weaken progress toward your main project, but sometimes they show you a new way of operating that is better than your original plan. A strategy that emerges from an unanticipated opportunity is called an emergent strategy.
> 
> For example, if you rose to fame as a health-food blogger and were offered the opportunity to open a donut shop, you might consider combining the two ideas to make a healthy donut shop.
> 
> The key, for both Christensen and Holiday, is to judiciously evaluate new opportunities to determine if they can be worthwhile extensions of your current success or if they’re more likely to distract you from your ultimate goals.

### Don’t Let Your Success Destroy Itself

Holiday notes that sometimes, the very traits that brought you success can, if unchecked, rob you of it. For example, to succeed, you ignored people who doubted you, but if you continue to ignore people who offer advice, you’ll miss warnings of legitimate threats. You were persistent, but if you are relentlessly persistent, you’ll chase opportunities that are destined to fail.

To avoid this trap, Holiday advises you look out for three feelings your ego might enhance:

- **Entitlement:** When confidence grows into hubris, you convince yourself that you are _entitled_ to the things you desire. Then, when you don’t receive something (for example, a raise or a promotion you consider rightfully yours), you feel like it was wrongfully stolen from you. You might then become confrontational and resentful, which makes people dislike you and makes them even less likely to help you toward your goals.
- **Paranoia:** Sometimes when you find success, your ego wants to show your doubters that they were wrong about you. If you become obsessed with proving your doubters wrong, you can become _paranoid_. You see doubters everywhere and invent enemies.
- **Control:** When some things go your way, you might start expecting _everything_ to go your way, as if you _control_ the world. Then, when things don’t go your way, you get upset. If your ego gets used to success, you can also become a perfectionist, needing to always be “right.” You might thus fight endless, pointless battles about small matters—for example, arguing with hotel clerks about room accommodations or customer service representatives about overblown complaints—and end up miserable.

Holiday contends you can avoid this fate by remembering that you don’t have a claim on anything that’s not already yours and by recognizing that you are not the center of the world.

> **The “Hubris” Syndrome**
> 
> Psychologists have identified a “[hubris syndrome](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/132/5/1396/354862),” which describes a mindset that people can develop after being in power for some time, in which they:
> 
> - View the world as a means of self-glorification
>     
> - Conflate themselves with their organization
>     
> - Have contempt for others
>     
> - Lose contact with reality
>     
> - Become impulsive
>     
> - Feel morally justified in her actions, no matter how unethical, practical, or costly
>     
> - Lose interest in the finer points of policy-making
>     
> - Become vulnerable to manipulation by people who recognize their need for flattery and use it to influence their decisions
>     
> 
> Ken Lay, who led energy company and commodities trader Enron to the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in history, is an example of someone who let his [ego and hubris guide his decisions](https://tucson.com/business/national-and-international/greed-ego-powered-enrons-fall/article_d45116ef-1ac0-5a69-9a1b-7d01fd924fe4.html).
> 
> In _[The Smartest Guys in the Room](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-smartest-guys-in-the-room/personal-traits-of-enron-managers)_, Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind discuss Lay’s ego-driven management style. After growing the company from a merger of small, regional energy companies into an international conglomerate worth $101 billion, he started displaying many of the signs of hubris syndrome listed above. He lost interest in the details of running the business and turned over operations to a set of questionably motivated underlings. He scared subordinates into silence, constantly pushed for growth without properly considering the consequences, and became obsessed with his public image as a savvy businessperson (which motivated him to lie about the business’s financial weaknesses).
> 
> Further, he remained convinced that his actions were morally justified, arguing to the end that he’d behaved no more poorly than many other companies and claiming Enron’s downfall was due to unscrupulous short-traders.
> 
> The hubris he exhibited showed the entitlement and overdeveloped sense of control that Holiday outlines as signs of an overactive ego, and led to the total loss of everything he’d achieved.

### Be a Manager, Not a Micromanager

Relinquishing control doesn’t mean letting other people run your business or make your choices for you. Rather, it means properly delegating and focusing your efforts on big-picture issues.

However, your ego wants you to be the boss of _everything_. It feels good to make decisions, and you feel important when everyone relies on you to put out fires. Unfortunately, while the _little things_ are fun to deal with, they’ll distract you from the _big things_, which are the important things that will determine your continued success (or lack thereof).

Further, if you can’t let go of the reins in your business, you’ll have a hard time steering it through trouble. **If you obsessively micromanage small details, you’ll be unable to spot big-picture issues that arise.**

Additionally, if you can’t delegate responsibilities, your employees are likely to resent your overbearing management style and are less likely to work as hard or be as effective as they could be if you allowed them to share responsibility.

> **Micromanagers Aren’t Leaders**
> 
> James Kouzes and Barry Posner discuss the danger of trying to exert too much control in their book _[The Leadership Challenge](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/principle-4)_. Like Holiday, they warn against the tendency to start micromanaging other peoples’ responsibilities, cautioning that doing so will limit you to the level of a supervisor or manager, and you’ll never rise to the level of a true leader. They argue that a leader is one who can stand back and trust her team, knowing that she’s hired capable people, trained them well, and given them the resources they need to succeed. By allowing other people to make decisions on their own, you’ll build a climate of trust that’s an essential element in a strong organization.
> 
> On the other hand, they warn that leaders who micromanage will end up with one of two extremes: either employees who resent them or employees who are dependent on them for decision-making. Neither outcome leads to a strong, independently functioning team.

### Find the Middle Ground

Holiday argues that the best way to prevent your ego from destroying your success is to maintain a balance between too much and too little ambition, so that you’re moving neither too fast nor too slowly.

He notes that it’s difficult to maintain this balance. On the one hand, it’s easy to stay endlessly ambitious: Simply keep going at a relentless pace until you burn out or are stopped by outside forces. On the other hand, it’s easy to be complacent: Simply stop moving forward, until the world overtakes both you and your good fortune. But both of these paths will lead to ruin. It’s harder to find the middle ground, where you are ambitious but know when to hit pause, but this is the path you must find in order to maintain long-term success.

> **Finding the Ambition Middle Ground**
> 
> Many management experts also note the importance of finding a [balance between too much and too little ambition](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/how-to-balance-ambition-and-happiness-5-tips.html). Not only will too much ambition drive you to grow too quickly and sabotage the success you’ve earned, but it also rarely leads to happiness—studies consistently show that chasing success either makes you unhappy (if you fail) or only temporarily happy (if you succeed). On the other end of the spectrum, too little ambition doesn’t lead to happiness either, as it leaves you feeling demotivated, bored, and unfulfilled.
> 
> One of the most effective ways you can avoid either of these traps, experts advise, is to focus on the process of your progress, not the outcome. This means doing things you enjoy because you enjoy them, not because you’re hoping for a certain reward at the end.

### See the Big Picture

Holiday contends that ego can destroy your happiness and then your success by focusing your attention on the material aspects of the here-and-now, which narrows your perspective so that you miss the truly important things that are happening beyond your peripheral vision. **When you lose sight of the big picture, success feels empty and purposeless, and you’re more likely to abandon it.**

Holiday maintains that this can happen when you forget that you are a small piece of an infinite puzzle that reaches not only outward into the universe but also reaches backward into time and forward into the future. However, when you remember how you fit into the world and into your place in time, you realize not only how small you are, but also how important you are, despite your tiny size.

Keeping these realizations in mind can keep you grounded and keep you focused on your purpose, making it easier for you to resist the urges of your egos to direct you toward the unimportant minutiae of life. Keeping your eye on the big picture can also help you prepare for when things go wrong, as they inevitably will.

> **Ego Gives You a Finite Mindset Rather Than an Infinite One**
> 
> Other management experts also advise that you keep your ego in check so it doesn't blind you to your larger purpose in life. Simon Sinek discusses this in depth in his book _[The Infinite Game](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-infinite-game/guideline-5)_, where, like Holiday, he cautions that leaders who fall victim to the urges of their egos can lose sight of their priorities.
> 
> Sinek’s theory is that every interaction in life (and in business in particular) is part of either a finite game (in which one player loses while another one wins) or an infinite game (where all players aim to keep playing). He argues that people who view business as an infinite game are more successful and have more longevity.
> 
> He notes that your ego can make you view life as a finite game by compelling you to “beat” others and by distracting you with the superficial trappings of success. A person who gets lost in their ego will lose sight of their Just Cause: their overriding, larger purpose that drives their decisions. When that happens, they start making poor choices that ultimately lead them to lose the success they’ve achieved.
> 
> Like Holiday, Sinek advises that you keep your eye on your larger purpose—the big picture—in order to prevent your ego from taking over.
> 
> Holiday’s earlier example of George C. Marshall again provides an illustration of this concept in action, demonstrating how a person can navigate difficult situations by keeping an eye on the larger picture in order to prevent their ego from causing problems. When he assumed the role of Chief of Staff, Marshall felt that his responsibility to the American people was to maintain a frank and honest relationship with Roosevelt. To maintain that relationship, he overlooked small slights or disagreements so that he could focus his energy on what mattered. In his own words, [“I swallowed the little things so that I could go to bat on the big ones.”](https://www.marshallfoundation.org/marshall/essays-remarks/george-c-marshall-study-character/)
> 
> This characteristic also points to Holiday’s earlier advice that you shouldn’t lose your temper or allow your ego to get upset by inconsequential slights, but instead that you should be prepared to let insults and wrongs roll off your back so that you can keep working toward your larger goal.
