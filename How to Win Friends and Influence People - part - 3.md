## Part 3: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

Praise is well and good, but what do you do when someone disagrees with you? That’s the next subject of _How to Win Friends and Influence People_. In summary:

**Put aside your instinct to fight fire with fire.** People don’t like to be proven wrong. They don’t like to admit they have to change their mind, no matter how right you supposedly are. They crave importance, and correcting them insults their pride. You think it’s important that you’re seen as the smartest person in the room, but you’ll be resented for this.

**So take the reverse approach.** Admit that you don’t know everything they do, and if you were in their shoes, you would certainly see things the way they do. Articulate your common high-level goals, and say you merely want to explore your differences in thinking. Let them speak their mind first, completely, without interruption.

If you still want to push your point, work them there through Socratic reasoning, getting them to answer “yes.” Get them to see your idea as theirs.

We’ve reordered the chapters to better reflect what you should do chronologically in a disagreement.
