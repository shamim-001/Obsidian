## Chapter 10: Unknown Unknowns

We’ve seen Voss stress the primacy of having information. Indeed, he says that at their most fundamental level, all negotiations are exercises in information-gathering.

But some pieces of information are easier to obtain than others. Voss writes that in every negotiation, **there is some hidden piece of information that, if it were known, would completely transform the dynamic of the negotiation and the final outcome**. He labels these Black Swans—and says that finding them is the last piece of the puzzle to succeed in your negotiation.

In this chapter, Voss explores:

- The three different types of information—known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (also called Black Swans)
- Why Black Swans have the power to transform the negotiating environment
- How to find your counterpart’s Black Swan and how this hidden information can give you access into how they think and see the world

### Types of Information

Voss writes that there are three types of information.

#### Known Knowns

First, there are _known knowns_. These are the things we know for sure. In a negotiation, the known knowns are things like **your counterpart’s name, their offer, and the knowledge gained from your experience in past negotiations**. Voss warns that, while it’s good to come into a negotiation with this kind of knowledge, it can also distort your reality and make you miss new information. The things you know as certainties can blind you to receiving new information, make you tunnel-visioned, and wrongly convince you that this is the _only_ kind of information.

#### Known Unknowns

Next, Voss describes _known unknowns_. **This is information that we know exists but that we don’t possess ourselves.** In a negotiation, a known unknown might be our counterpart’s price ceiling (i.e., the highest amount they’re willing to pay) or her dealbreaker condition. We know she _has_ these; we just don’t know what they are.

> **What _Not_ To Reveal in a Negotiation**
> 
> Voss focuses on navigating the information about your counterpart that you either know or don’t know. But, as other negotiation experts write, it’s also important to make sure that some of _your_ information remains unknown to your counterpart. Over at the Harvard negotiation blog, they argue that there are costs and benefits to every piece of information that you reveal to your counterpart. According to Harvard, there are [four categories of information that you should always try to keep secret in a negotiation](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/when-not-to-show-your-hand/):
> 
> - Things that are delicate or sensitive, like proprietary information or trade secrets.
>     
> - Information that you’re not authorized to share. For example, your boss may instruct you that some news about your company (perhaps a planned move to another city or a major personnel announcement) is not public information and is not to be shared.
>     
> - Things that can weaken your bargaining position. For example, if you’re selling your house because you need to relocate to another city for work, you might want to think twice before revealing that to a buyer. She might conclude that you’re desperate to sell and could use that as leverage to lowball you.
>     
> - Information that is uncertain or subject to change.
>     

#### Unknown Unknowns: Black Swans

But the most important pieces of information, according to Voss, are the _unknown unknowns_. **These are the bits of information that we lack—and, crucially, don’t _know_ that we lack. These are the Black Swans.**

Your task in a negotiation is to uncover your Black Swans (the pieces of information about your counterpart that will give you unparalleled insight into her mental processes, desires, and hidden anxieties) by asking the right questions. In a negotiation, those who can best identify and exploit the unknown unknowns are those who come out on top.

For example, let’s say you were looking to buy a house from someone. If, in the course of your negotiation with the seller, you discovered that they were facing some sort of external financial pressures (from a lawsuit or a job loss), you would have great leverage over them. This information would tell you that your counterpart was a highly motivated seller who would likely accept a heavily discounted offer from you. This is a Black Swan—something you didn’t know before, didn’t know that you didn’t know, and that completely reshapes the negotiating dynamic.

(Shortform note: Although he doesn’t mention its use in this context, Voss probably recognized the term “unknown unknowns” when it entered the popular lexicon—albeit somewhat infamously—in 2002 when [then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REWeBzGuzCc) during a media availability in which he was questioned by reporters about the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq. The supposed existence of such weapons stockpiles was the cornerstone of the George W. Bush administration’s case for invading Iraq, which they ultimately did in spring 2003. Rumsfeld used the term to argue that even if there was no evidence of WMDs, the existence of “unknown unknowns” meant that the administration could never be fully certain they weren’t there. Critics of the Bush administration accused Rumsfeld of using the notion of unknown unknowns to justify his decision to invade Iraq when he couldn't offer known knowns to do so.)

### How to Find the Black Swan

Voss highlights some important tactics for finding your counterpart’s Black Swan:

#### Get Face-Time to Pick Up Nonverbal Cues.

Voss argues that too much is lost with impersonal media like email. These indirect modes of communication don’t allow you to hear your counterpart’s tone of voice, and you won’t see the unplanned, non-verbal signals that they might be sending you. Voss also advises you to remember that **spoken words only represent 7% of human communication.** Likewise, email gives your counterpart too much time to rehearse their responses and stall for time. You’ll miss those little, unguarded, spontaneous moments that can be such rich sources of information.

(Shortform note: Although Voss could not have anticipated this when he published his book in 2016, [the COVID-19 pandemic made it difficult for businesspeople to conduct in-person meetings and negotiations](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/business-negotiations/videoconferencing-in-business-negotiation/), with such gatherings largely moving to virtual platforms like Skype, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. Working with other people without the benefit of face-to-face interaction created a number of pitfalls, including inability to see the totality of a person’s body language (since they usually just appear as “talking heads’); difficulty of making direct eye contact, which inhibits trust-building; and a heightened awareness of racial, ethnic, age, and gender differences between ourselves and our counterparts, since videoconferencing enables us to simultaneously see ourselves and the other person—something that doesn’t happen with in-person interactions and that may subconsciously force us to lean back on stereotypes.)

#### Exploit Feelings of Similarity

Voss writes that decades of social science research shows that we are more likely to trust people whom we see as similar to ourselves. Voss advises you to look for what you have in common with your counterpart. Build a rapport with them and create a conversational—even confidential—atmosphere. By doing this, you take your counterpart out of their “negotiation” mindset. In doing so, they’ll start to reveal key bits of valuable information that they otherwise wouldn’t because they believe they have a bond with you.

(Shortform note: This technique can also be used for nefarious purposes, unfortunately. [Con artists often practice a form of deception known as affinity fraud](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affinityfraud.asp#:~:text=Affinity%20fraud%20is%20a%20type,a%20Ponzi%20or%20pyramid%20scheme.), in which they target and exploit members of their own age, racial, religious, or other identity group. Their exploitation is effective because their victims see the con artist as being someone like them, which causes them to feel a level of trust and let their guard down in a way they might not with someone they perceive to be an “outsider.” Perhaps the most notorious—and most successful—affinity fraudster was Bernard Madoff, who targeted affluent and well-connected Jewish individuals and organizations (Madoff himself was Jewish and active in these circles), and [stole an estimated $17.5 billion from his victims](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2021/04/14/the-investors-who-had-to-pay-back-billions-in-ill-gotten-gains-from-bernie-madoffs-ponzi-scheme/?sh=258cb61764ed).)

### How to Use the Black Swan

Ultimately, says Voss, uncovering a Black Swan gives you _leverage_—**the power to inflict loss or withhold gain**. And as we’ve learned, calculating losses and gains is difficult for people to actually do. There are three types of leverage: positive leverage, negative leverage, and normative leverage.

#### Positive Leverage

**Positive leverage is the power to give someone something they want.** According to Voss, the best way to exercise positive leverage is to give your counterpart what _they_ want by making them give you something that _you_ want. This is the classic mutually beneficial or “win-win” negotiating scenario. If you can figure out that your counterpart’s Black Swan is something they desire, you can use positive leverage to help them achieve it if they help you achieve your aims.

We see this in routine interpersonal transactions all the time, but the concept even applies to high-level trade and economic agreements between nations. For example, the United States might allow China to export its goods to the American market (something Chinese manufacturers want very much), but only on the condition that China lower its own trade barriers, eliminate export subsidies, and crack down on intellectual property theft (things that are greatly desired by the American business community).

> **Positive Leverage and the Capitalist System**
> 
> In its most idealized form, the entire system of capitalism and free enterprise is a giant web of trillions of positive-leverage transactions in which both parties benefit and end up with greater utility than they did before.
> 
> In _[Basic Economics](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/basic-economics)_, Thomas Sowell argues that in a free-market system, millions of individual consumers and producers exchange resources (money, goods, and services) with each other, each working to better their own individual circumstances. In doing so, each party betters themselves and also betters their counterpart at the same time—so that, for example, when someone buys a car, both the purchaser and the car manufacturer improve their lives. Additionally, everyone who was involved in the production and sale of that car, from factory workers to truckers to dealership owners, benefits by leveraging their time, effort, and skills for a paycheck, with which they can then leverage other purchases. The system is built on the concept of fair trades—positive leverages.

#### Negative Leverage

**Negative leverage, says Voss, is the power to inflict harm or take away something that someone else values.** It’s inherently based on threats and triggering your counterpart’s sense of loss aversion.

In order to harness the power of negative leverage, you need to figure out what would constitute a “loss” for your counterpart. Voss reminds us that these losses are _not_ always monetary or tangible. It can be a loss of status, prestige, ego, or reputation.

He recommends using subtle labeling to allude to their fear of loss. For example, if you sense that your counterpart greatly values their reputation as an honest dealer, you would label their behavior by saying, **“It doesn’t seem like you care about being seen as straightforward.”**

> **Honor, Reputation, and Cultural Barriers to Negotiation**
> 
> The non-monetary or intangible assets alluded to by Voss that some negotiators fear losing carry different weight across different cultures. Research shows that [international or cross-cultural negotiations are powerfully shaped by individuals’ different cultural norms and values](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/international-negotiation-daily/overcoming-cultural-barriers-in-negotiation-how-to-launch-more-productive-cross-cultural-negotiations/) about what’s right or wrong, important or unimportant, and public or private.
> 
> Anthropologists divide the world’s cultures into three broad types—dignity, face, and honor cultures. People from dignity cultures (like the U.S. and Western Europe) tend to be highly individualistic, valuing independence and individual initiative. Because they come from countries with strong traditions of rule of law and sanctity of contract, their approach to negotiation tends to feature high levels of trust and focus on finding mutually beneficial solutions.
> 
> People from face cultures (primarily East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea) value social harmony, tend to elevate the good of the group over that of the individual, and show strong deference toward elders and authority figures. Because of their need to save face and preserve harmony, their approach to negotiation tends to focus on indirect questioning and collective decision-making, with direct confrontation or threats a rarity.
> 
> Lastly, people from honor cultures (like Latin America) tend to be highly protective of their perceived in-group (like family) and react aggressively to perceived slights to status. Because of these cultural traits, they tend to be less willing to trust their negotiating counterparts, for fear of being betrayed or double-crossed by them.

#### Normative Leverage

Lastly, Voss describes **normative leverage as when you use someone’s _own_ norms and standards against them**. You do this by pointing out the gap between their behavior and their professed principles. Something like, “You say that you value transparency and openness, but it seems like you’re being evasive and indirect with your answers to my questions,” can be a powerful indictment that forces your counterpart to rethink their behavior. **No one likes to feel like a hypocrite.**

(Shortform note: While it may be strategically beneficial in a negotiation to play upon your counterpart’s anxiety about being a hypocrite, other writers have noted that hypocrisy is a fairly universal human trait. In _[The Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/1-page-summary)_, Jonathan Haidt writes that, while we may enjoy pointing out the hypocrisy of others and relish the feeling of moral superiority that it gives us, we are _all_ hypocrites to some degree or another, excoriating others for behavior that we ourselves engage in. Haidt argues that we are able to do this without suffering cognitive dissonance because we as humans excel at inventing rationales for why whatever we’re doing _at the moment_ is virtuous—or at the very least, justifiable. Therefore, when using normative leverage against your counterpart to point out hypocrisy, watch out for the possibility that they might do the same to you and thereby activate your _own_ anxiety about being a hypocrite.)

### Speaking Your Counterpart’s Language

Voss writes that Black Swans also give us key insights into how our counterpart sees the world. Once you know this, you’ve cracked the code—you can speak to them fluently in a language they understand.

When you find their Black Swan, you access their hidden area, their deeper desires. This enables you to predict what they’ll do next. Knowing their Black Swans can also **prevent you from thinking your counterpart is “crazy” just because you don’t understand their behavior.** If someone is behaving in a way that seems irrational or counterintuitive, remember—there’s likely some piece of information that you don’t know (and don’t _know_ that you don’t know) that creates its own internal logic and rationale for them. In other words, because they have a different set of knowledge and beliefs than you, their view of the situation—and thus, the actions that stem from that view—probably make perfect sense to them. As Voss has emphasized, it comes down to empathy—standing in someone else’s shoes and trying to see the world the way _they_ see it.

For example, the 9/11 hijackers undeniably committed a heinous crime that resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. And it certainly seems to most observers that hijacking a plane and crashing it into a populated building (resulting in the deaths of everyone on the plane, including themselves, as well as many people in the buildings and on the ground) is an act of extreme irrationality. But accounts of the planning and execution of the attacks highlighted that the young men who carried them out were motivated by a mix of genuine ideological and religious convictions and believed that they were acting on behalf of oppressed Muslims around the world. In their worldview, _any_ action would be defensible in order to combat the evil forces of Western (and specifically American) religious oppression they believed themselves to be combating.

Voss writes that what _looks_ like crazy behavior by your counterpart may really be rational, because:

- They have bad or incomplete information.
- They face external constraints that prevent them from making a deal and are too embarrassed to admit it.
- They have other wants, needs, incentives, or agendas beyond what they’re expressing.

> **Information Asymmetry Skews Negotiations**
> 
> Voss’s argument that irrational or inexplicable behavior by a party in a negotiation is often the result of them having poor information is a concept known as _information asymmetry_. In _[Freakonomics](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/freakonomics)_, authors Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner write that information asymmetry occurs when information is unequally distributed between parties. Not only does this sometimes cause one party to think the other is acting irrationally, but it also gives an enormous advantage to the party that has the greater amount of information. This has major implications in a negotiation, in which experts will take advantage of knowing more than the other party to extract value from them.
> 
> Levitt and Dubner cite the example of a real estate agent, whom you might think is acting with your best interests at heart. But she’s actually using her vastly superior knowledge of the real estate market to get the best deal for _herself_. With her information advantage, she can convince you that a lowball offer on your house is actually a good one and encourage you to quickly sell your house below-market—so she can quickly pocket her commission and move on to her next client.
> 
> In your negotiations, be mindful of any situation in which you as a layperson find yourself at an information disadvantage relative to an expert. And, if you can’t figure out why your counterpart is acting a certain way (for example, you can’t figure out why your realtor is advising that you settle for the first bid you get), instead of assuming they’re acting irrationally, look for a possible information asymmetry that might be affecting your negotiations.

### Black Swan Examples

Voss expands upon his analysis of Black Swans by exploring two different real-life hostage scenarios (a subject in which he is well-versed given his background as a top FBI hostage negotiator) in which law enforcement officials respectively failed and then succeeded in understanding a hostage-taker's true motivations.

While obviously far more dramatic and high-stakes than any negotiating scenario a reader is likely to find herself in, these extreme examples serve to highlight the importance of uncovering hidden information and understanding a counterpart’s true motivations. These are principles that apply to _any_ negotiation.

#### Example #1: William Griffin, a Black Swan Tragedy

In 1981, William Griffin walked into a bank and proceeded to take nine employees hostage. Based on prior experience with hostage scenarios, police expected Griffin to ultimately surrender peacefully. This was their known known—or so they thought. However, Griffin shocked police when he executed one of his hostages in plain sight, before being killed himself by police sniper fire.

In this case, **the authorities made the tragic mistake of not understanding Griffin’s _real_ motivations.** Griffin didn’t want money or recognition. Instead, his real motivation was to die—and he knew that executing a hostage would provoke the police into shooting him in a “suicide-by-cop” scenario. The tragic killing of the hostage happened because t**he authorities failed to recognize Griffin’s true wants, needs, and incentives.** This was a classic Black Swan—something that the authorities didn’t _know_, didn’t even _consider_, and would have completely changed their response _had_ they known it.

> As Voss writes, the police on the Griffin case relied too heavily on their existing beliefs about what a hostage-taker would want to achieve from their crime and were unable or unwilling to entertain any information that might have challenged this belief. This is an example of what psychologists call the confirmation bias—in which people seek out information that confirms what they already believe and ignore anything that challenges those beliefs.
> 
> The police in this case had an outdated idea of what a hostage situation was and were only willing to approach it from within that framework. But there are ways to overcome the confirmation bias. In his book _[The Black Swan](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan)_, Nassim Nicholas Taleb recommends a technique called “negative empiricism,” in which you seek out information that disproves your original belief. Had the police in the 1981 Griffin case done this, they may have been more open to the possibility of an unpredictable and unprecedented scenario (in other words, a Black Swan) that would have entirely transformed how they approached the hostage standoff.

#### Example #2: Dwight Watson, a Black Swan Success

The story of Dwight Watson presents the opposite case. This was an instance where an FBI hostage negotiation team (led by Chris Voss) _successfully_ identified a Black Swan and used it to de-escalate what could have been a dangerous situation.

In March 2003, Dwight Watson drove a tractor full of what he claimed to be explosives to Washington, D.C. and threatened to detonate his device. In their discussions with Watson, however, the FBI learned that he was a devout Christian. This Black Swan gave the authorities valuable insight into Watson’s state of mind, his motivations, and how to craft appeals to his religious ideals that would let him surrender without losing face.

This worked because **the authorities put in the hard work to gain a holistic understanding of Watson’s view of the world**. It may have made little sense to the individuals on the FBI team, but it certainly made sense to Watson. This breakthrough came because the team was willing to _listen_.

> **Counterpoint: Compassion Is Better Than Empathy**
> 
> Voss writes that, in the Watson case, FBI negotiators used empathy in order to understand Watson’s view of the world (in his case, that of a devout Christian) and to make specific appeals to him that spoke to his religious convictions. However, not all commentators agree with Voss’s view that empathy is the key to negotiations—or to human relations in general.
> 
> In _[Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/against-empathy-paul-bloom)_, Harvard psychologist Paul Bloom draws a crucial distinction between empathy and compassion. Empathy, he argues, is the internalization of the emotions of others—feeling angry when they feel angry, sad when they feel sad, and so on. According to Bloom, empathy (however well intentioned) is counterproductive because taking on the emotions of others will inevitably become exhausting and unpleasant—and ultimately make you want to _withdraw_ from efforts to help others.
> 
> Bloom also argues that the concept of empathy suffers from another fatal design flaw, namely that we are more naturally inclined to extend toward others who look and think like us. Further, because it involves putting yourself in someone else’s proverbial shoes, empathy is impossible to scale—even if you can feel empathy for your neighbor or for people in your community, according to Bloom, is it really possible for you to cast that emotional onto the nearly eight billion people on the planet? For these reasons, argues Bloom, empathy is an inadequate tool for overcoming global systemic racial, gender, linguistic, and other barriers.
> 
> Compassion, says Bloom, is different. With compassion, rather than simply reflecting back the emotions of others, we assign value and meaning to the emotions of others—and, crucially, to the _people_ expressing them. Compassion does not trigger the same feeling of emotional fatigue as empathy. Instead, a compassionate person will be inspired and motivated to help.
> 
> When viewed in this light, it could be argued that what the FBI negotiators really exhibited in the Watson case was not empathy, but rather, compassion. They did not merely ape or mimic Watson’s emotional state. Instead, they used their understanding of his worldview and emotional frame of mind to make appeals based on the innate value of human life—both Watson’s own and the people he was threatening to kill.
