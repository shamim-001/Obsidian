#port-number 
A port number is a way to identify specific services or processes running on a computer or server. It is like a door or entrance that allows communication between different applications or services.

Port numbers range from 0 to 65535 and are divided into three categories:

1. Well-known Ports (0-1023): These are reserved for specific services that are commonly used on the internet. For example:
    
    - Port 80 is used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) traffic, which is the protocol used for web browsing.
    - Port 443 is used for HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) traffic, which is the encrypted version of HTTP used for secure communication, such as accessing websites with SSL/TLS encryption.
2. Registered Ports (1024-49151): These are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to specific services or processes that are not as widely used as the well-known ports. Examples include:
    
    - Port 3306 is used for MySQL database communication.
    - Port 22 is used for SSH (Secure Shell) remote access.
3. Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-65535): These ports can be used by applications dynamically or temporarily for their own purposes.
    

To put it in simple terms, let's imagine a large office building where different departments handle specific tasks. Each department has its own door (port) through which people (data packets) enter and exit. Here are a few examples:

- The mailroom (port 25) handles incoming and outgoing mail (SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
- The customer service department (port 80) deals with customer inquiries (HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
- The accounting department (port 3306) manages financial data (MySQL database).
- The IT department (port 22) controls remote access to the company's servers (SSH - Secure Shell).

In this analogy, the office building represents a computer or server, and each department's door represents a port number associated with a specific service or process.

In summary, port numbers allow different services or applications on a computer or server to communicate with each other. They act as gateways, enabling data packets to be directed to the appropriate service or process based on the port number associated with it.

If your computer is a house, think of port numbers as doors - ways to enter and exit house. You can have multiple ports "opened" that will allow processes to enter and exit their data through the computer. There are a few important things about port numbers though:

- Port numbers under 1023 (i.e. from 0 to 1023) are privileged ports. That means they require certain administrative access to be "opened"
- There are some port numbers reserved for certain operations. Although you can change them, but they still technically are popular choices. For example, HTTP runs on port 80 (or 8080), HTTPS on port 443 (or 8443). SSH runs on port 22. DNS runs on port 53, and so on.
- Port numbers are not infinite.
- You have a finite number of ports, and the range of ports is from 0 to 65535. This means you cannot start a process on port number 70000 (as it is outside the valid port range)
