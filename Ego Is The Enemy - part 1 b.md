## Part 1B: Attaining Success: How to Act

Now that we’ve discussed some ways that ego prevents you from _thinking_ about yourself and the world properly, we’ll explore some ways ego can prevent you from _doing_ the right things. We’ll also look at how you can correct these impulses so that your ego doesn’t get in the way of your dreams.

### Aim to _Do_ Something, Rather Than _Be_ Someone

Holiday warns that ego can stop you from achieving your goals when it leads you to try to _be somebody_ (earn the recognition that comes with doing a job the way others expect you to) rather than to _do something_ (accomplish things that would elevate your profession or the world at large).

When you start your career, you typically envision accomplishing great things—leaving a mark and making a difference in the world. However, it’s easy to get distracted from your mission by things that give the _appearance_ of success, such as a high number of Twitter followers or a lofty job title. People confuse these things with _actual_ accomplishment, even though they don’t necessarily indicate competence (sometimes, for example, promotions go to people who check the right boxes—they’ve gone to the right business school or are members of a certain social club—rather than to people who have done things to earn them).

Holiday cautions that **at some point in your career, you’ll have the choice of prioritizing either recognition or accomplishment.** If you choose recognition, you’ll seek promotions, plum assignments, and the favor of your superiors. However, to earn these markers of success, you may have to compromise your values and turn your back on your friends.

However, if you choose accomplishment, you might not get the plum assignments or the promotions, but you won’t feel the need to compromise your values or betray your friends to obtain superficial markers of success. **You’ll contribute ideas to the world that will positively affect the lives of others**: of people who follow behind you in your career or in life.

Holiday references General George Marshall, a World War II officer, as an example of someone who did good work in part because he focused on his tasks and responsibilities instead of his title or legacy. Marshall was one of the most influential actors of the time (the Marshall Plan, detailing how US aid would help Europe recover from the war, was named after him). However, he was so adamant about not letting his ego drive his decisions that he didn’t even keep a diary during the war—he feared that if he did, he might start making decisions with an eye to posterity instead of based on what needed to be done in the moment.

He also twice put his career on the line to speak his mind to people in positions of power over him when he disagreed with them—disagreements significant enough that they made their way into history books. First, during World War I, he stood up for his direct superior by [correcting a general who was excoriating him](https://warontherocks.com/2017/10/when-marshall-met-pershing/), leading many witnesses to predict his career was over. Second, during World War II, [he openly disagreed with Roosevelt](https://www.marshallfoundation.org/marshall/essays-remarks/george-c-marshall-study-character/) in a meeting about military maneuvers, again prompting witnesses to predict the end of his career. Both times, he did what he felt was important to do even if it meant he would personally be negatively affected.

Fortunately, in each instance, the superior with whom he disagreed recognized the value of hearing an honest opinion, and instead of discouraging Marshall, they started to seek him out for advice—Roosevelt even promoted him to Chief of Staff. This also speaks to the ability of those superiors to conquer their _own_ egos, for had their egos been offended by Marshall’s remarks, the country might have been deprived of one of the clearest-minded military thinkers of the era.

> **Can You Do Something Without Being Someone?**
> 
> One thing that Holiday doesn’t address is the fact that people sometimes can’t do great things unless they are in a position of influence, and getting to a position of influence might necessitate chasing a promotion or lofty title—and thus engaging in what Holiday might deem ego-driven goals. In other words, sometimes you need to _be someone_ (with recognition) _before_ you can _do something_ (with accomplishments).
> 
> This debate recalls our earlier discussion of Holiday’s views on self-promotion through a Stoic lens. As we discussed, Holiday’s interpretation of Stoicism doesn’t require that you have no self-interest. In fact, many Stoics would argue that if your self-interest serves a larger purpose and doesn’t prevent a larger good, then that self-interest is not only allowable, but is also desirable.
> 
> Some Stoics point out that their view of self-interest is not so different from Adam Smith’s theories, where Smith advocates not for greed, but for [enlightened self-interest that in turn makes a better society for everyone](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-capitalist-can-we-pursue-both-virtue-profit-charles-rathmann#:~:text=Stoics%20have%20a%20term%20for,rather%20than%20just%20our%20own.) (people working to better their own lives will create jobs and opportunities for others in the process). These contemporary Stoics allege that the only real difference between Stoic philosophies and those underpinning capitalism are where they lie on the spectrum: Stoics would put the needs of the greater community slightly ahead of the needs of the individual (as does Holiday), while followers of Smith would do the opposite.
> 
> With this distinction in mind, the nuance in Holiday’s arguments in this section become clearer—he doesn’t advocate that you spend your career on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder, but rather, that if you have the opportunity to reach for either a superficial marker of success (like a lofty title) or a meaningful contribution to society, you choose the latter.
> 
> Holiday’s discussion about Marshall’s career illustrates this unaddressed aspect of his argument. Holiday devotes a significant amount of text to Marshall (as many historians have—Marshall was widely recognized as a remarkable and selfless leader, who turned down the chance to lead the entire Allied forces and repeatedly refused to accept promotions), but still, despite his humility, Marshall was one of the most powerful men in the country, serving as Roosevelt’s right-hand man and directing much of the war’s movements. He would not have had such influence from a lower rank.

### Control Your Passion

Holiday counters the popular belief that passion drives you toward your goals, and that passion is an essential element in achieving success. Instead, he says **passion is often the thing preventing you from achieving your goals.**

He emphasizes that you do need to _care_ about your project, but he argues that passion goes beyond mere caring: Passion is unchecked enthusiasm in the service of some lofty, vague goal that blunts your critical thinking. When you’re passionate about a project, you’re blinded to the issues that might sabotage it. You ignore the objections that other people raise. You jump ahead too fast, before mastering the skills you need and before fully understanding all the elements of your project. Consequently, passion often ends up masking a weakness in a project—one that may very well sink it later when reality intrudes.

History is littered with examples of passionate people who rushed into a venture only to be defeated by the obstacles they’d ignored in their ardor. Holiday refers to the examples of George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, who ignored the dangers their advisors raised about invading Iraq, pushed ahead with their invasion, and were met with harsh reality. Similarly, Holiday notes that the mountain climbers caught tragically in the fatal 1996 Everest climb were driven by passion to bypass preparation. In the business world, the inventors of the self-balancing scooter Segway ignored the lack of market demand and rushed ahead with their much-hyped project, only to be met with a half-hearted consumer reaction. Many entrepreneurial ventures meet the same fate.

In contrast, Holiday argues that people who don’t allow themselves to be carried away with enthusiasm achieve a lot. For example, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, widely considered one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history, was famously “dispassionate,” operating under the philosophy of _stay in control_ and _do your job_. Similarly, Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the most influential female activists of the 20th century, once said, “I hardly think the word ‘passionate’ applies to me.”

> **Good Passions Versus Bad Passions**
> 
> Among those readers who criticized Holiday’s book, one of the most common objections regarded his advice to ignore your passion. Many readers voiced skepticism at the notion that a person can pursue a long-term goal through difficult times and over many years without some degree of passion driving them.
> 
> However, Holiday’s ideas on passion are consistent with Stoic thinking that [differentiates between good passions](https://modernstoicism.com/new-video-john-sellars-on-stoicism-and-emotions-stoic-week-london-day/) (emotional responses based on accurate judgments about things that are important to your life) and _bad passions_ (emotional responses based on mistaken judgments). In recognizing this difference, Stoics don’t advise rejecting all emotions (defined as mental responses that are not based in rationality), but only those that lead us to faulty thinking and unpleasant consequences.
> 
> So, for example, a person who’s decided to pursue wealth might do so because of good passions, like a desire to contribute in a positive way to society or to better her children’s standards of living so they can be productive citizens. Stoics would argue that there is nothing wrong with this sort of passion. However, if her passion gets twisted by ego, so that she starts pursuing wealth because it makes her feel better than others and she damages relationships with people around her in the process, Stoics would say those are bad passions.
> 
> Holiday’s ideas correspond to these notions of good and bad passions—while he doesn’t use that terminology, his examples illustrate the difference. Bush, Rumsfeld, the Everest climbers, and the Segway designers succumbed to bad passions sparked by poor judgment that blinded them to the reality of their situations. In contrast, Eleanor Roosevelt and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar didn’t allow themselves to be swept up in emotional passion—but no one would ever suggest either was indifferent to their chosen careers. They were both driven by strong emotional commitment, but not by ego-influenced passion.

#### Seek Purpose and Realism

Holiday notes that enthusiasm can be good when it motivates you, but he insists that to temper it, **you must balance enthusiasm with _purpose_ and _realism_.**

- **Purpose is passion with parameters.** It’s a vision about something other than yourself that guides your decisions.
- **Realism is a detached perspective that allows you to evaluate logistics.** Realism asks, What’s the first step? What’s the _second_ step? How are you measuring your progress? What’s not worth pursuing?

Holiday advises that to operate with purpose and realism:

- Consult professionals or mentors. Ask lots of questions about what could go wrong. Ask for examples from their experience.
- Plan for obstacles. Make contingency plans for when things go sideways.
- Start with small steps. Complete those steps, evaluate them, and figure out how to complete the next steps more efficiently or productively.
- Lock in gains little by little. Use these gains to earn your next gains. Eventually, you’ll start to see exponential growth rather than summative growth.

> **Accountability and Realistic Goals Will Keep You on Track**
> 
> In his book _[The Chimp Paradox](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-chimp-paradox/planet-6)_, Steve Peters explores additional ways you can focus on realistic and purposeful steps to prevent your ego from sabotaging your success. Peters compares an ego to an inner chimpanzee that drives our decisions through a mixture of desire and fear. As he tells it, your inner chimp is always looking out for your own, selfish interests and seeks short-term, easy success. It can prevent you from earning success by aiming for a lofty goal and then distracting you from it or by making you readily give up on your goal if the going gets difficult.
> 
> Like Holiday, Peters advises that you approach any new project with a realistic strategy that ensures that you’re aiming for a reasonable goal and that you have the mental tools in place to stick with it. He suggests you spend time thinking through four aspects of your project in order to properly prepare you for the journey:
> 
> - **Realistic goals:** Recognize the difference between dreams (unrealistic ambitions that your ego is drawn to) and goals (reasonable ambitions).
>     
> - **Accountability:** To prevent your chimp (your ego) from abandoning a project when it loses its emotion-based inspiration, set up benchmarks of progress that will hold you on track, such as deadlines or checkpoints for steps along the way.
>     
> - **Ownership:** When you feel like you’re responsible for a project because you’ve designed it in some significant way or it speaks to who you are as a person, your ego will see it as part of your identity and will work harder and longer for it.
>     
> - **Honesty about obstacles:** Examine what you’ll need for your project (the basic essentials as well as the nice-to-haves) and size up what challenges you might face along the way that could derail you.
>     

### Do the Work

Holiday cautions that another way your ego will hold you back from achieving your goals is by discouraging you from doing the hard work necessary to accomplish them.

He argues that this is because your ego loves you just as you are now: It thinks you’re amazing and your ideas are brilliant. Very often, a person who enjoys thinking these thoughts will go no further than to _have_ brilliant ideas, as the thoughts alone are satisfying enough, and she won’t bother _working_ to bring those brilliant ideas to life. Unfortunately, no matter how brilliant her ideas, they alone won’t bring her success. **Success comes not from genius, but from the sweat and labor you put into your genius.**

Countless people have come up with amazing, innovative ideas but never worked hard to bring them alive, and consequently, none of those brilliant ideas saw the light of day. Holiday points to the example of the great painter Edgar Degas, who wanted to branch out from painting and express himself through poetry, but he was unable to write any despite having a head full of inspiration. A poet friend of his pointed out that it was not the _ideas_ that made poetry, it was the _words_—that is to say, Degas could only produce poetry by actually sitting down and doing the work of writing it. He never did, though, and today we have no Degas poetry.

(Shortform note: Degas is far from alone in this failure—so many writers have come up with brilliant book ideas they never executed that it’s become a cliché.)

> **Inspiration Versus Perspiration**
> 
> Holiday’s arguments echo the well-known adage “Success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.” Since being inspired is so much more enjoyable than perspiring, many people focus on thinking about their goals instead of working toward them.
> 
> A tendency to wallow in inspiration recalls Holiday’s earlier caution not to get caught up in self-promoting talk, either on social media or to your friends and family—when you promote yourself, you engage in a type of _positive visualization_, and ironically, positive visualization can sap you of the mental energy you need to complete a task.
> 
> In the same way, when you focus on inspiring thoughts and feelings, you get a feeling of satisfaction that may prove “enough” for you, and you may consequently lose the drive to actually accomplish something.

### Become a Lifelong Student

Holiday notes that your ego can interfere with your ability to achieve your goals by **convincing you that you don’t need improvement, that you know everything you need to know, and that you can stop learning.** However, the need to learn never actually ends. Even people who have mastered a skill and are at the top of their game can still learn ways to get better. To counter the false belief that you are beyond needing improvement and to open yourself to a life of learning:

- Honestly assess yourself and acknowledge your shortcomings.
- Accept that others know more than you do.
- Seek out people who can teach you and be open to their feedback, no matter how negative.
- Constantly be on the lookout for the next challenge, so that you can continue to learn and grow.

Most importantly, resist the whisper of your ego telling you what a spectacular, innovative genius you are. Silence your ego and admit you need assistance.

Holiday points to Kirk Hammett, the guitarist for the blockbuster metal band Metallica, as an example of someone who suppressed his ego to become a lifelong learner. When Hammett was offered the job, Metallica was an up-and-coming group quickly making a name for themselves regionally. Hammett could have thought to himself, “I’ve made it—I’ve achieved success,” and spent the rest of his career coasting on his existing skills. However, he reacted differently; he decided he wasn’t as good a guitar player as he’d like to be, and he set about striving to correct that.

He found a teacher—Joe Satriani—and subjected himself to Satriani’s rigorous instruction. Satriani later explained what made Hammett a better student than other guitarists he taught was Hammett’s willingness to receive harsh, honest feedback, and to work diligently to correct what needed improving. In other words, Hammett was open to hearing what he was doing wrong when most people weren’t. That openness made all the difference; Hammett continued to improve as a guitarist and artist and helped drive Metallica to international superstardom.

> **Tempering Your Ego Rather Than Eliminating It**
> 
> Again, Holiday uses an example of a rich and powerful person who may have had a large ego—which might be expected from a member of one of the most successful rock bands of all time. In fact, at some points, Hammett demonstrated an unchecked ego, including several periods during his career where he struggled with cocaine addiction (Holiday references drug use as a negative side effect of an ego).
> 
> However, it’s likely that Holiday’s larger point is not that Hammett needed to eliminate all aspects of his ego in order to become successful, but that he had to temper it so that it didn’t drive his decisions or get in the way of his progress. The periods where Hammett’s ego took over were periods that he regretted and fought through, eventually conquering those negative traits so that they didn’t derail him.
> 
> This points to a nuance of Holiday’s argument that he doesn’t explicitly spell out, but which is clearly present: He doesn’t argue that you should have no ego at all, nor does he argue that you shouldn’t crave superficial markers of success—he only argues that you should maintain a balance between no ego and too much ego so that you can stay focused on your goals.

Holiday notes that in today’s world, technology provides easy access to a world of learning, and advises that you take advantage of the wealth of training courses, books, and online instruction available.

> **Schedule Your Learning**
> 
> Many business experts agree that learning can be the difference between success and failure, and that one of the traits that self-made millionaires consistently attribute to their success is their [commitment to lifelong learning](https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/7-ways-to-become-a-more-effective-lifelong-learner.html).
> 
> Unfortunately, even if you know the importance of learning, it can be hard to put the advice into practice when your day is already full of tasks, activities, and responsibilities. For this reason, many experts advise that you purposefully schedule time during your day to devote to learning. Robin Sharma advocates for this technique in his book _[The 5 AM Club](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-am-club)_, in which he notes that so few people actively become lifelong learners that [you can easily set yourself above your competition](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-am-club/part-4) by continually expanding your knowledge. He recommends that you create a “student hour” in your daily routine where you explore podcasts, books, articles, videos, or courses (online or in-person), noting that the more you learn, the more sophisticated your ideas and connections become, giving you a leg up in your profession.
