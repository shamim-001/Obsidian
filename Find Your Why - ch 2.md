# Find Your Why

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Chapter 2: Your Purpose Is at the Core of Everything You Do

We’ve discussed the importance of finding your purpose and its benefits. Next, we’ll explore how to use your purpose to guide your life and work. We’ll start with a three-part model Sinek first introduced in _[Start With Why](https://shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why/1-page-summary)_, which illustrates how having a central purpose affects your actions (your "How" or methods) and your results ("What" you accomplish).

### Sinek’s “Golden Circle”

Sinek created the “Golden Circle” model **to help you find fulfillment** by placing your day-to-day actions and your strengths in the context of your purpose, or Why. In other words, his model helps you see whether the action you’re taking aligns with your purpose and thus whether it will bring you fulfillment or distract you from your Why.

(Shortform note: In _[Designing Your Life](https://shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life)_, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans provide a similar tool: a Life Compass. It places your life and work philosophies side by side so you can identify where they overlap and [determine whether your actions are in accord with your philosophies, or beliefs about what you do and why](https://shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life/chapter-2).)

Sinek’s model consists of three concentric circles. Each circle represents one of the core concepts in his theory.

**1. The innermost circle is the Why:** the _purpose_ that orients everything you do. It’s the core belief that motivates you to get out of bed in the morning. In terms of an organization, it’s the mission you stand for and the reason you’re in business. An organization’s Why might be to provide accessible health care to its community. An individual’s Why might be to create spaces for learning.

**2. The middle circle is the How:** your typical _methods and practices_ that characterize you, and which other people consider your strengths. Your How brings your Why to life. An organization’s How or method might be to always pursue the most sustainable alternatives. An individual’s How might be to forge meaningful connections.

**3. The outermost circle is the What:** the _outputs_ or results you generate. It’s the tangible part of your organization or life and the easiest to identify. An organization's What includes its products, services, policies, and strategies. An individual's What might be their family, job, and projects.

(Shortform note: While fans praise Sinek for [clearly and succinctly bringing together three important elements](https://blog.dtssydney.com/praise-criticism-the-golden-circle-sinek) of an organization’s or individual’s work, critics point out that his model is [missing one core question](https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-simon-sinek-is-fundamentally-wrong/): Who? They argue that organizations that use Sinek’s model and begin from Why, as he instructs, overlook the most important element in a business: the customers. An organization might have a compelling Why, but if they can’t find a customer who’s interested in it, they won’t be successful. Thus, you might want to complement Sinek’s model by asking yourself who you’re serving and what they need before you ask yourself why you’re in the business of serving them.)

#### Your Why and How Are Unique

Sinek stresses that you shouldn’t worry about your Why being unique or about being the only person or organization with your How, or particular set of methods. He believes that your Why and How _together_ are what set you apart. **Even though others might have a similar Why or How, the way you combine yours is unique.** (Shortform note: If you worry that the specificity of your Why, or purpose, and How, or methods, is limiting, consider Meg Jay’s advice in _[The Defining Decade](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-defining-decade)_: Rather than believing that committing to a specific path limits you, recognize that [not committing leads to a haphazard, unexceptional life](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-defining-decade/finding-work#build-uniqueness-from-common-parts).)

> **Start at the Core to Change Your Behavior**
> 
> While Sinek’s model focuses on the big picture of your life’s purpose, it can also help you make improvements in specific aspects of your life. James Clear’s [layers of behavior change](https://shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits/chapter-2#the-layers-of-change), outlined in _[Atomic Habits](https://shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits)_, [follow the same pattern](https://medium.com/@slowwco/understanding-your-brain-connecting-the-golden-circle-simon-sinek-the-three-layers-of-8750e7478df5) as Sinek’s model:
> 
> - The outermost layer consists of outcomes, the results you want to achieve.
>     
> - The middle layer consists of processes or behaviors.
>     
> - The innermost layer consists of your identity, who you are and what you believe.
>     
> 
> In the same way that Sinek advocates for starting with your Why, Clear argues that to change your behavior, you should [start at the center and create identity-driven habits](https://shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits#identity-based-habits) based on [who you are and what you believe](https://shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits#identity-based-habits), instead of focusing on the outer layer and creating goal- or outcome-driven habits. Clear says that building identity-driven habits aimed at the person you want to be creates lasting change, in contrast to goal-driven habits that you practice only in the short term, until you meet the goal.

##### Example: Elon Musk's Golden Circle

Let’s consider Elon Musk to see how Sinek’s model works in practice. How do his disparate business ventures make sense in the context of his purpose? Based on some of his [comments](https://www.startalkradio.net/show/the-future-of-humanity-with-elon-musk/#), we can infer that Musk’s Why, or purpose, is to secure the future of humanity and reduce the likelihood of eventual extinction. That purpose leads him to push the boundaries of innovation (his How) and create ventures including Neuralink and Tesla (his What or outcome).

### We’re Wired for Purpose

**Sinek argues that his model mimics how our brains work.** He explains that What and How appeal to the neocortex. This outer part of the brain is well-equipped to process factual information, but not emotions, and it doesn’t hold a significant sway over your decisions. On the other hand, Why is meaningful and persuasive because it originates from—and appeals to—the limbic system. This core part of your brain processes emotions and governs decision-making. (Shortform note: Sinek’s biological justification for his framework has [received some criticism](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-scientific-evidence-to-support-Simon-Sineks-theory-of-The-Golden-Circle): Neuroscience hasn’t produced clear evidence that one discrete part of the brain handles facts while another handles emotions.)

Our most powerful human connections come from the ability to communicate limbic system to limbic system. However, Sinek says communication doesn't come naturally to this emotional core of your brain—you have to dig through the facts and data of the neocortex level to get to emotions that live in your limbic system. Then, **by putting your Why into words, you create a way for people to hear and connect with what’s in your limbic system.** (Shortform note: Ancient rhetoricians identified pathos—the appeal to emotions—as the most persuasive type of rhetoric. As Jay Heinrichs notes in _[Thank You for Arguing](https://shortform.com/app/book/thank-you-for-arguing),_ pathos gets your listener to [agree with you and take an action](https://shortform.com/app/book/thank-you-for-arguing/1-page-summary#use-em-pathos-em-to-persuade-your-audience) you’re inviting them to.)

#### Lead With Your Purpose

Sinek says companies and individuals should lead with their purpose when talking to customers, clients, suppliers, etc., because by keeping your purpose to yourself, you only let others (for example, customers or potential employers) see your outputs and methods without knowing what’s driving you. The connection they make with you or your organization is surface-level. According to Sinek, this doesn’t foster long-term relationships. Let’s explore why:

**Leading with What, or outcomes:** You introduce yourself or your organization by talking about your product or service. Some people decide to buy from you, hire you, or join you—but only for as long as you’re the cheapest or most convenient option.

**Leading with How, or methods:** You introduce yourself or your organization by talking about the unique methods or practices that set you apart from the competition. Some people choose you—until your way of doing things catches on, and you become one of many similar options with the same How.

**Leading with Why, or purpose:** You introduce yourself or your organization by talking about your mission, the problem you’re trying to solve, or the fundamental belief you have about the future. More people choose you because they understand that supporting you means supporting that purpose. Other competitors might offer similar outcomes or methods in the future, and maybe even at more convenient terms, but you will always have the advantage of the emotional connection you forged by involving people in your purpose.

(Shortform note: This concept of leading with your purpose is not new to sales. For example, in _[To Sell Is Human](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/to-sell-is-human)_, Daniel Pink recommends a model based on trust and a genuine interest in serving the customer rather than wanting to take advantage of them. His two rules for service-oriented selling are to [make it personal and to make it purposeful](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/to-sell-is-human/chapter-9). By leading with your Why rather than What or How, you highlight the purpose of what you or your organization do and focus on what makes you unique, thereby applying Pink’s rules.)

##### Example: Its Why Makes SpaceX Different

Elon Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, leads with Why.

The company boasts outcomes including spacecraft, satellites, and human spaceflight projects. However, listing these outcomes doesn’t fully explain what makes SpaceX inspiring when compared to other space flight companies creating similar products.

One of the methods SpaceX takes to reach these outcomes is pursuing sustainability and commercial viability simultaneously. This led them to create reusable spacecraft, a rideshare service for satellites and commercial space flights. But, again, companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic have similar methods. So why does SpaceX stand out?

It comes down to SpaceX’s purpose: Its mission—or Why—is to make humanity multiplanetary. According to Musk himself, that purpose is what [separates his organization from its competitors](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/elon-musk-interview). It does so because it triggers our fears and hopes by appealing to a deep human desire to a) survive the existential challenges on earth, and b) discover what lies beyond what we already know.
