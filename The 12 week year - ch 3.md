# The 12 Week Year

## Chapter 3: Discipline 2—Plan Your Execution

Many people believe that simply having a compelling vision is enough. They sit back and wait for the universe to provide what they need to succeed. But **the universe only responds to what you do, not what you dream about. You must _act_ to achieve your full potential**.

A compelling vision requires a compelling plan of action. You can’t navigate a new life if you don’t know which path to take to get there. Planning has three advantages that help you stay on track to reach your short- and long-term goals. You can work out all the mishaps you might face along the way when you take the time to plan on paper before you start to act. And as you reduce your mistakes, you save precious energy and time because you won’t waste either backtracking to fix errors made during a typical trial and error period. If you start to plan and end up somewhere you don’t want to be, you can readjust your plan without risking wasted capital.

### A 12-Week Plan Versus a 12-Month Plan

You sharpen your planning skills when you focus your plan on 12-week production cycles. A 12-week plan has several advantages over a year-long plan:

**1. You Increase Predictability**

You can’t possibly predict every action you'll take over a 12-month period, so any plan made over this amount of time will be based on assumptions. Assumptions only allow you to guess at where you’ll be and what is possible at a certain point in your process. In contrast, **a 12-week plan removes assumptions because the time frame is short enough for you to make accurate predictions of your future actions**. After you set your vision for the future and break it into bite-sized behaviors that accumulate into the bigger picture, you will clearly see what tasks need to be accomplished first.

**2. You Increase Focus**

When you reduce your goal into bite-sized segments of action, you no longer have to manage multiple objectives at once. A year-long plan will include many different tasks that compose the overall goal, but too many objectives lead to confusion and inactivity because you’re trying to do too many things at once. When you train your focus on one or two actions at a time, you can tackle each task with a high degree of success. Each successful completion of your 12-week plan sets you up to build on that success in the next 12 weeks.

**3. You Develop a Strong Structure for Your Work**

How you structure your plan determines your level of execution. Lengthy plans tend to involve too much theory and not enough practical application. In contrast, **12-week plans create clear tactics for accomplishing your goals within three months, and those tactics become your daily and weekly responsibilities**. Tactics must be action-oriented and involve deadlines for each one. Within these time constraints, you’ll be able to follow your structured path toward your goal one action at a time with a sense of urgency.

### Your 12-Week Plan

Now that you have your long-term vision and short-term goals determined, it’s time to start writing your first 12-week plan to begin the journey of achievement. Without a solid plan, you may become impatient with your results and rush your behaviors to get to the end faster. This action will lead to gaps in your process that can critically hinder your success.

Even if you know what you need to do, writing it down makes your actions more concrete and helps you stay on track when life’s distractions threaten your focus. **With a solid plan, you ensure you’re living each day in the moment and proactively working on the right tasks, rather than reactively working on whatever comes your way.** A plan helps you create the triggers for your actions, instead of waiting for life to trigger your actions.

#### Important Considerations of a Good Plan

Within the 12-week plan, a week now takes the place of a month, and each day accounts for a week. Through this lens, you can see how important each day and week are to your overall plan, and your daily activities become more important than your long-term objectives. Your plan of action for these activities should not be considered a glorified to-do list. Your plan should be an intentionally structured step-by-step process for how each day of work will lead to your weekly goal, which eventually leads to the completion of your overall 12-week goal.

You need to think of your plan like directions for a road trip. If you’re driving cross-country, missing turns, gaps in location, and misordered directions will get you lost every time. Likewise, a plan that skips necessary steps, overloads one task with too many objectives, and places actions in an unfavorable sequence will not lead you to your desired results.

Also, your plan needs to be actionable, not merely a set of ideas and wishes. Imagine a direction on your map that said, “Point the car west to get to California.” If you’re starting in Iowa, you’ll have no clear route to follow and will waste time guessing. **Be specific in the actions needed to reach your goal.**

Your plan can relate to either your short-term goals or long-term execution. Short-term goals might be a specific level of income, number of clients for your business, a certain weight, or new skill for your personal life. Long-term execution goals might be a college degree, larger staff, new operating system, or long life. With execution goals, your immediate efforts become focused on building a predetermined future state. Regardless of which type of plan it is, you must have a clear target you’re aiming for within the 12 weeks.

#### Your Plan Structure

First, you need a clear goal. **Your 12-week plan might have more than one goal, but don’t overwhelm your efforts by trying to achieve too much too early.** Remember, a 12-week plan is just one part of the process. You will continue to build more 12-week plans from the foundation created by the previous plan.

When you have a clear goal, list the various tasks that will help achieve that goal. At this point, list all that come to mind. You will refine the list later to only the most important ones, but you won’t know which they are if you don’t exhaust all the possibilities first.

Both your goals and tasks should follow these criteria:

**1. Make them specific and measurable.** You need to quantify and qualify your actions so you’ll be able to measure the success of your results.

**2. Focus on the positive.** Write your goals and tactics in a language that promotes wins, not avoids losses. Rather than “reduce error rate by 25%,” write, “Increase positive outcomes by 75%.”

**3. Push yourself, but not too far.** If your goal is too easy to reach, you’re not pushing your success enough. If it’s too hard, you’ll become frustrated.

**4. Promote accountability.** If you’re working alone, own your process. If you’re working as part of a team or leading a team, assign responsibility to individuals. Ownership promotes follow-through. This topic will be elaborated on in a later chapter.

**5. Set deadlines.** Set clear time parameters for when each goal and task should be achieved. This means detailing the day or week by which specific progress needs to be made.

#### Put Your Plan on Paper

You don’t need to figure everything out perfectly to begin writing your plan. **Refer to your long- and short-term goals to get a good idea of what you need to accomplish without overanalyzing your strategy.** You will check back in with your plan throughout the process using measures, and adjustments can be made at any time.

At the top of the page, write your first 12-week goal. Then, list the most significant action required to start the process, and specify which week this action will take place and the daily activities required within that week to achieve it. Continue with the rest of the tasks and weeks through 12.

You can bolster your chances of success by making a list of actions you anticipate experiencing difficulty with and how you will manage those difficulties. When you hit those snags, you’ll know what to do without panicking.

Taking the requisite time to plan may seem like a waste of time, but the time spent will save you time in the future. A solid plan of action can save 20% of the time normally required to complete a task without a clear path forward.

#### Common Errors

Make sure to avoid these common mistakes when you write your plan:

- The 12-week goals do not align with your long- and short-term goals.
- You have too many goals and tasks to focus on the priority actions.
- You don’t make the hard choices to rank your tasks.
- Your tasks are too convoluted.
- Your tasks are not significant enough to create momentum for the future.
