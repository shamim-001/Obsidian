## Chapters 4-5: Getting the Right Responses

After you’ve displayed calculated empathy and put your counterpart in a relaxed emotional frame of mind, Voss writes that it’s important to elicit the proper responses from them. In the following chapters, Voss describes which responses you do and don’t want to hear from your counterpart—and the emotional impulses behind even seemingly simple and routine responses like “Yes,” “No,” and “That’s right.”

Voss explores:

- Why “Yes” is seldom the answer you want to hear from your counterpart
- Why “No” is actually a positive response from the other person and indicates that they’re feeling comfortable and in control
- Why “That’s right” is a sign that you’ve made real progress in getting your counterpart to see you as a partner rather than an adversary

### The Problem With “Yes”

As Voss writes, much of old-school negotiating strategy is premised on the idea of “getting to yes”—with the titular 1981 book _Getting to Yes_ being the touchstone text of the genre.

He says it’s easy to understand why this makes intuitive sense. Your counterpart saying “Yes” to something you’ve proposed in your negotiation would seem to mean that you’ve reached some sort of agreement or that they’ve acceded to your conditions.

But, Voss cautions, “Yes” is often the fool’s gold of negotiation because **people often say “yes” just to get someone else off their back**. This false yes does not signal any true agreement or commitment—it’s just a way to end a conversation with someone who’s being too aggressive and domineering.

Another false “yes” that Voss cautions you not to take seriously is the “yes” response that follows leading questions. People use this false “yes” when pushy salespeople ask them a series of leading questions whose obvious answer is “yes,” in the hopes that they’ll trap the person into eventually saying “yes” to whatever they’re selling. But, even after repeatedly answering “yes” to a salesperson’s leading questions, most people won’t want to say “yes” to the overall negotiation. Instead, they’ll feel pressured and manipulated, and thus more likely to ultimately say no.

(Shortform note: Voss writes that people often give vaguely affirmative responses even when they really want to say “No.” This may be related to [a personality trait called agreeableness](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/retirement/t064-c032-s014-dealing-with-people-who-say-yes-but-mean-no.html). People who rank high on the agreeability scale have a strong desire to get along with others, and often have an extreme fear of being disliked. This often leads such people to say what they _think_ others want to hear and results in them making commitments that they don’t actually intend to follow through with. This fear of disappointing others ultimately leads to damaged personal and professional relationships.)

> **A False Yes Dialogue**
> 
> Here’s how such an exchange might go on the phone.
> 
> You: Hello?
> 
> Salesperson: Hi, I’m with RestaurantCoupons.com and I’m calling you with a special offer.
> 
> You: Ok.
> 
> Salesperson: Do you like eating delicious food at high-quality restaurants?
> 
> You: **Yeah, sure. (Leading Questions “Yes”)**
> 
> Salesperson: And do you enjoy saving money?
> 
> You: **I guess I do, sure.**
> 
> Salesperson: Well then you’ll love our offer. We’ll send you a coupon giving you 20% off the next time you dine at one of our participating restaurants. Wouldn’t it be great to treat the family to a great meal for a fraction of the price?
>

>

> 
> You: **Well, ok, I guess… (“Get Off My Back” Yes)**

### The Power of “No”

To avoid these false yeses and get a real, firm commitment from your counterpart, Voss argues that you need to do something that may seem counterintuitive—**you need to get them to say “No.”**

In Voss’s analysis, **“No” signals the _beginning_ of a successful negotiation, not the end of one. Saying it makes your counterpart feel _in control_.** According to Voss, this speaks to a basic psychological need for autonomy. When we say “no” to something, it is a powerful assertion of control. We are setting boundaries and demonstrating our independence in the most fundamental way. We are saying, “_I_ am in control, and I will not let external forces dictate what I do.”

As Voss argues, **once the other person feels more secure having said “no,” the real negotiation can begin.**

> **The “No” Phase and Children**
> 
> Voss writes that our negotiating counterparts often feel the need to say “no” in order to assert their autonomy. But it’s not just adult negotiators who have a need to draw boundaries this way—young toddlers also assert their boundaries using “no.”
> 
> Many parents know that young children around two or three years old usually become highly disagreeable and refuse even the most simple requests or directives from their parents by shouting “No!” (even with things they’ve previously agreed to with little trouble).
> 
> Despite the stress it causes parents, the “no” phase is actually an important part of early childhood development. This is the age at which [children are experiencing the most rapid brain development](https://www.todaysparent.com/family/parenting/why-your-toddlers-no-phase-is-so-important-and-how-to-survive-it/) that they’ll ever experience in their lives, with over 4,000 new neural connections being formed every minute.
> 
> This neurological growth is actually what drives the much-lamented toddler stubbornness. This is the age at which children are developing for the first time a sense of autonomy and self-awareness. They have a developmental need to draw lines in the sand and form their own opinions—and this newfound independence often comes in the form of “no.” Childhood development experts argue, however, that the “no” phase is crucial to their growth as they become well-adjusted children and, ultimately, functional adults.

#### Getting to “No”

So, how do you get to “no”?

According to Voss, you need to **ask your counterpart open-ended questions that are designed to prompt negative answers**. Answering these questions gives them a sense of autonomy and control. You can do this by:

- Deliberately _mis_labeling their emotions or desires, forcing them to correct you: “It seems like you’re not actually interested in coming to a solution with me. Is that what’s going on?”
- Asking what they _don’t_ want, giving them a free hand to draw their boundaries and establish their comfort zone—while revealing negotiating limits that you can later use to tailor your offers and counteroffers: “Before we get into the specifics, are there any absolute red line, dealbreaker scenarios for you? What are some hypothetical things in this deal that you’d absolutely refuse to accept?”

> **Say “No” Without Damaging Your Relationship**
> 
> In _[The Power of a Positive No](https://www.allencheng.com/the-power-of-a-positive-no-book-summary-william-ury/),_ William Ury writes about the “positive no”—a way of saying “no” to people that doesn’t damage your relationship with them or hurt their feelings. Rather, the positive no is a self-empowerment tactic, a way of asserting your autonomy and confidently but respectfully refusing to comply with requests that you don’t want to. Rather than giving in by saying “yes” when you don’t want to, rudely and brisky saying “no,” or avoiding confrontation altogether, Ury recommends the positive no as a way to ground your refusal in mutual respect.
> 
> For example, if a colleague asks you to stay late at work to finish a project, a positive no would be, “I’m sorry, I can’t work late tonight. I recognize that the project is important and I’m fully committed to helping you. But I want to be home to read to my daughter at night, and I won’t be able to do that if I’m here at the office. Instead, why don’t I move some of my meetings around tomorrow and clear time during the workday so that you and I can finish this project?”

#### Taking Advantage of “No”

Once you’ve given someone the freedom and autonomy to say “no,” how do you take the next step and transform that into a successful negotiation? Voss recommends asking solution-based questions or labeling the effect of the “no.”

Solution-based questions can be fairly simple and straightforward, like “What about this doesn’t work for you?” or “What would you need to make this work?”

Labeling the effect of the “no” can be something like, “Based on how you’re responding to me, it seems like we might not have enough common ground to reach an agreement.”

(Shortform note: Although Voss doesn’t explicitly make the connection, it seems that these tactics of solution-based questions and labeling are designed to put your counterpart in a solution-oriented frame of mind. Your counterpart will be forced to give thoughtful, considerate answers and work through her path to getting to “yes.” Similarly, labeling the effect of the “no” by implying that you think they’re not interested in working with you can trigger the opposite response from your counterpart. Since it’s unlikely that your counterpart is really uninterested in coming to an agreement with you—otherwise they wouldn’t be sitting down to negotiate with you in the first place—such labels can have the effect of making her _reaffirm_ her commitment to the negotiation and refocus her mind on finding common ground and building consensus.)

> **Shortform Example: How To Get to “No”**
> 
> To demonstrate how labeling would work in a scenario like this, take a look at the brief dialogue below. Notice how Person 2 vocalizes the effect of Person 1’s “no.”
> 
> Person 1: “**No**, I don’t like those terms.”
> 
> Person 2: **“It seems like there’s some real resistance on your part to what we’re discussing.” (Label)**
> 
> Person 1: “Well, I’m definitely not comfortable with where we stand.”
> 
> Person 2: “I hear what you’re saying. And **it sounds like there’s a disconnect and that you think I’m trying to pull one over on you.” (Label)**
> 
> Person 1: “**No**, I don’t think you’re doing that, I just want to get to a place where I’m feeling comfortable about going forward with this deal.”

### “That’s Right”: Getting Affirmation From Your Counterpart

After you’ve set your counterpart at ease by giving them the freedom and autonomy to say “No,” you want to bring them around to _your_ way of seeing things. To do so, make some statement about their feelings or motivations designed to receive a positive affirmation from them through what Voss describes as two of the best words you can hope to hear in any negotiation—“That’s right.”

Although it’s a simple phrase that can be easily missed, Voss writes that there is great power in those two words. According to him, **when someone says “that’s right,” it means that they’ve come to embrace what _you’ve_ said.** They’re crediting you with seeing things their way and now feel that they are dealing with someone who understands and respects their point of view.

For your counterpart, this is the best of both worlds. **They get to agree with you (and thereby forge a bond) without feeling like they’ve caved**. This satisfies their basic emotional needs for both safety _and_ autonomy.

Beyond just putting them in a more positive emotional frame of mind, “That’s right” also gives you an important strategic advantage. You now have your counterpart’s self-confirmed view of the situation. This gives you a valuable window into their true motivations and desires. By saying “That’s right,” **they’ve stated their position unequivocally—which you can now use to commit them to _your_ preferred course of action**.

> **Commitment and the Consistency Principle**
> 
> Voss writes that “That’s right” gives you a window into someone else’s mind by providing you their self-confirmed view of the situation under discussion—which you can then use to commit them to your preferred course of action. This idea of using someone’s else’s stated commitments to steer them toward desired thought and behavior is closely related to what Robert Cialdini calls the Consistency Principle in _[Influence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/1-page-summary)_. Cialdini argues that humans have an obsession with sticking to their guns—and that consistency is closely related to commitment.
> 
> Once we’ve committed to a course of action or to a belief, we pressure ourselves to conform to that commitment, going through great mental gymnastics to convince ourselves that our current behavior and beliefs align with our past behavior and beliefs—even when they clearly don’t.
> 
> The Consistency Principle creates a valuable opening for you in a negotiation. If you can get your counterpart to make even a small commitment, you can potentially get them to make larger and larger ones.

#### Getting to “That’s Right”

So how do you get your counterpart to say “That’s right?” Voss recommends taking the following steps.

- Listen: Use the power of silence by letting them talk until all the emotion is drained from the conversation. Use your active listening skills to absorb all of the information they’re giving you. Allow for pauses and use occasional interjections like “Sure,” or “I see” to indicate that you’re listening.
- Reflect back: Repeat back your counterpart’s concerns to build empathy and rapport.
- Label: Demystify their fears by naming their emotions through simple phrases like, “It seems like you’re distressed.”
- Paraphrase: Go a step further than labeling by _paraphrasing_. Instead of parroting back what they’re saying, put their story into your _own_ words to demonstrate that you really get it. For example, your counterpart might say, “I’m getting a little uncomfortable. My boss wants me to secure this deal by the end of the week, so I’m operating on a fairly tight deadline. I don’t think you fully understand the pressure I’m under and I don’t feel like you’re taking my position into account. You can paraphrase that by saying, “I hear that and thank you for clarifying the bind that you’re in. You’re facing a time crunch on your end and you feel like we haven’t made enough progress so far because I’m not taking the time to put myself in your shoes.”

> **AMPP: Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, Prime**
> 
> In _[Crucial Conversations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/crucial-conversations),_ authors Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler argue that paraphrasing is a crucial tool to get others to participate in a dialogue—especially when they are reluctant to do so.
> 
> They cite paraphrasing as one of the four key listening tools of their AMPP (Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, Prime) strategy. By asking even simple questions like, “What do you mean?” you are building a bridge that will help you understand the other person’s views. When you mirror their responses, you’re showing yourself to be a familiar, understanding dialogue partner—especially when your tone and nonverbal language matches the words coming out of your mouth. Paraphrasing makes them feel even more safe, because it demonstrates that you’re open minded, closely listening, and empathetic, since you were able to articulate their feelings in your own words. Lastly, the authors encourage you to prime the other person’s responses by verbally guessing what their emotional state might be and encouraging them to respond.
> 
> Priming closely tracks Voss’s technique of open-ended questions, as it is designed to elicit thoughtful and solution-oriented responses.

> **Example: Affirm Their View by Paraphrasing**
> 
> To show how this works in a real-world scenario, we’ve created a brief sample dialogue between a car dealer and a potential customer. Pay close attention to how the car dealer rephrases the customer’s concerns in her own words.
> 
> Customer: “I don’t like the options in this car.”
> 
> Dealer: “OK.” **(Active listening/intermittent interjection)**
> 
> Customer: The tech is outdated, there’s no extended warranty coverage for the tires.”
> 
> Dealer: “I see.” **(Active listening/intermittent interjection).**
> 
> Customer: And the dealership isn’t offering anything like a free oil change or inspection.”
> 
> **(Silence)**
> 
> Dealer: “I hear your concerns. It sounds like you don’t like the stereo and Bluetooth setup, you’re concerned that you’ll have to eat the whole cost if you get a flat tire, and that we’re not taking care of you with free services.” **(Paraphrasing)**
> 
> Customer: “That’s right.”

#### Summarizing

According to Voss, another way to help your counterpart see you as a partner who recognizes and understands their view of things is summarizing. Note that this is different from labeling or paraphrasing.

Voss says you should **think of summarizing as paraphrasing + labeling**. You’re rearticulating what they’ve said while acknowledging the _underlying emotions_ that drove them to say it.

(Shortform note: The benefits of summarizing in communication go far beyond influencing how your counterpart sees you. _[In 12 Rules for Life](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life)_, author Jordan Peterson identifies summarizing as the most effective listening technique. Peterson argues that it forces you as the summarizer to take the time to genuinely understand what is being said, rather than skirting over it on the surface; gives the person a chance to correct what you said, or emphasize something you didn’t; and helps you extract the true moral of the story.)

#### Example: Creating Empathy—With a Kidnapper

As an example, Voss discusses his negotiations with Abu Sabaya, a violent kidnapper in the Philippines. When Sabaya kidnapped an American (a young man from California), he claimed he was doing so in exchange for “war damages.” In other words, he believed that he was engaged in a noble struggle for the rights of the oppressed Muslim minority in the Philippines.

Obviously, Voss and his team of American hostage negotiators thought Sabaya’s self-image and professed cause was utterly divorced from reality. But that was irrelevant. The negotiators still needed to show _empathy_ for Sabaya’s beliefs in order to be able to work with him and bring the hostage standoff to a peaceful resolution. Over the course of months, they were able to identify and summarize Sabaya’s worldview and build the rapport they needed.

> **Labeling and Summarizing to Build Rapport**
> 
> Voss doesn’t provide the extended dialogue for how he and his team reached this breakthrough in the book. We’ve created one here to better demonstrate how summarizing would work in practice.
> 
> Sabaya: “We’ve been talking for months, and I don’t think you Americans are even trying to understand _why_ I’m doing this.”
> 
> FBI: **“It sounds like you think we don’t care about your motivations or ideology.” (Label)**
> 
> Sabaya: “You don’t, and you’ll only have yourselves to blame when I execute this hostage for all the world to see!”
> 
> FBI: “You’re fighting for your people. You believe that Filipino Muslims have been oppressed for centuries by Catholics, even down to the present day. You’re resorting to violence because you feel that all the other options haven’t worked. **It makes sense why you’re so angry.” (Summary)**
> 
> Sabaya: **“That’s right!”**
> 
> Voss writes that when they were rewarded with a “that’s right” after accurately summarizing his claims of oppression, they knew they had made the crucial breakthrough. Sabaya ended up not harming the hostage (despite his clear stated intentions of doing so), who ultimately was safely returned to his family in the United States.

### The Genuine “Yes”

(Shortform note: This section originally appears in Chapter 8 of Voss’s book. We’ve moved it up as it directly pertains to the discussion of key phrases like “Yes,” “No,” and “That’s Right.”)

Ultimately what you want in any negotiation is to get to the Genuine “Yes.” This is a “yes” that signals both agreement _and_ commitment. They’re accepting your terms and they’re pledging to fulfill them.

Voss outlines a process **to see if the “yes” your counterpart is giving you is genuine.** Here’s how he explains it.

- Get them to say “yes” at least three times to see if it’s only a Get Off My Back or Leading Questions Yes instead of the Genuine Yes you’re looking for.
- After the first “yes,” label or summarize what they’re saying to prompt a “That’s right.”
- Then, ask “how” or “what” open-ended questions (we’ll go into further detail on these kinds of questions when we cover open-ended questions in Chapter 8) to lay out how you and your counterpart will define success according to the agreement. Examples of phrases to use are, “What do you see as the main hurdles that can stop us from following through on this?” or “How do you see potential ways we might be blocked from getting this done?”

> **Six Steps to Get to Yes**
> 
> In _Getting to Yes_, [Ury and Fisher take a somewhat different approach to “yes” than Voss](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/six-guidelines-for-getting-to-yes/). They recommend:
> 
> - Focusing on understanding your counterpart’s view of the situation rather than emotionally reacting to their words or behavior (either with aggression on your part or ill-considered concessions).
>     
> - Breaking impasses by centering the discussion around broader convictions and interests rather than specific positions. For example, if you’re buying a car, avoiding rigid positions like, “I won’t pay more than $15,000” and instead focusing on the real reasons that buying the car is valuable to you (safety, convenience).
>     
> - Regulating emotions by establishing clear emotional boundaries. For example, at the outset of a negotiation, the parties can mutually agree to pause the discussion if any of them feels themselves getting too heated or even designating set times for when certain emotions can be expressed.
>     
> - Conveying an appreciation and understanding of your counterpart’s perspective and making sure to vocalize that understanding (this actually does dovetail nicely with Voss’s emphasis on empathy).
>     
> - Framing things in a positive way, even if there is disagreement. For example, if you feel that someone you’re negotiating with is being obstinate or unreasonable, you can say, “We’ve worked together successfully many times in the past. In this negotiation, however, I don’t feel you and I are enjoying our usual easy rapport. Is there something happening that’s presenting a roadblock for us here?”
>     
> - Avoiding an escalating cycle of tit-for-tat. Sometimes in negotiations, there’s a temptation to match the intensity or posture of your counterpart. If they reject your offer, you reject their counteroffer. If they refuse to budge on one item, you stand pat on something of your own. To break this self-defeating cycle, Fisher and Ury argue that you should simply refuse to react to these kinds of provocation. Instead of letting your counterpart dictate your actions, be flexible, don’t get sucked in by your emotions, and explore opportunities for mutual collaboration and consensus-building.

#### A Genuine Yes Dialogue

Here’s how a customer might secure a Genuine Yes from a car dealer:

Customer: “So, do we have a deal?”

Salesperson: “Yep, we sure do! Congratulations!” **(Yes #1)**

Customer: “Great. So just to confirm, I’m getting this vehicle at $20,000, with financing coming in at 4.5%, with the extra leg room and free oil changes and inspections every six months?” **(Summarize)**

Salesperson: “That’s right, that’s what we agreed to.” **(“That’s right” and Yes #2)**

Customer: “Fantastic, I’m glad we’re on the same page. And what on your end would stand in the way of us being able to close on these terms?” **(open-ended question)**

Salesperson: “I don’t see anything standing in the way on my end here. I’ve already confirmed this with my boss and with our financing people. I can’t foresee anything that would derail this. But even if we _were_ to hit some sort of hurdle, I’ll personally make sure that we secure this vehicle for you on these terms.” **(Yes #3)**.

Customer: “Great. Can’t wait to sign those papers!”
