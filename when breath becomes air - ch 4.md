## Chapter 4: Completing My Medical Tutelage

Part of the neurosurgical residency training is taking time to train in another field. The standard of excellence is high in neurosurgery; thus, the expectation is for you to be well-rounded and excellent in all aspects of medicine to fully excel.

I chose to move into one of the most difficult, yet highly regarded roles: that of neurosurgeon-neuroscientist.

I moved to a laboratory at Stanford to work with scientists focused on the development of neural prosthetics. These devices could allow those without motor functions to control things in the outside world with their minds. The brain sends signals out to sensors that activate the command. What I wanted to do was the opposite. I wanted to manipulate the signals _within_ the brain, a process called neuromodulation.

The possible benefits of neuromodulation were vast. Successful manipulation of neural activity could help treat a number of conditions of the brain and mind, such as OCD, depression, or Huntington’s disease. I set to work learning and experimenting with cutting-edge research. However, a year in, V, the head of the lab, told me he had pancreatic cancer. After he told me, he asked me if I thought he’d made the right choices---whether his life had meaning. I had always considered V to be a sort of moral guide, and it was shocking to hear him question meaning, as I had so often, now that he was facing death.

After a long and difficult treatment, V was in remission. He came back to work after a year, when I was preparing to head back to surgery. At the last of what had been weekly discussions, he told me that today was the first day the suffering he’d endured felt worth it. I understood then that no matter how far down I had to go to meet my patients where they were, I would never truly understand, as a mere doctor, their cost of living.

### The Illusion of Time

The concept of time ceases to exist in the OR, or at least not in the way it exists for everyone else. To be a good surgeon, you had to be efficient, swift, but not careless. It was a fine line, for the priority was on speed. Speed ensures that patients don’t experience distress or damage during long procedures. Speed also ensures that surgeon’s and supportive OR staff make it home in time for dinner.

One could approach surgery like the old story of the tortoise and the hare. You could move fast, seemingly out of control, making small movements at a time to ensure success. Or you could be more methodical, allotting time to organize your movements, then performing them perfectly and efficiently. Either way, there is no sense of how much time is going by while you’re in it. Time becomes an illusion, and you remember it only after you are finished, when the hours catch up to real time, knocking into you, knocking you down.

### The Final Stretch

I became chief resident my final year, which meant more responsibility, and not just on my cases. The bar for success had been raised, and conversely, so had the ramifications of failure. Everything I had learned, technically and personally, were wound together. All of it carried a moral weight. The threshold between life and death, that narrow space, required dedication to my skills and to my patient’s identities. Whether to proceed with surgery or not dictated an appraisal of both.

I was riding high. I was performing my surgical duties with mastery, and my research was highly respected. Surgical departments were vying for my abilities, but the position I wanted was the one right where I was. Stanford was looking for a neurosurgeon-neuroscientist to study neuromodulation. I knew I was perfect for the role, and they did, too. I was starting to get a clear picture of what this world was about and how I fit into it.

My friend Jeff, from my early years of residency, wasn’t so lucky. Following the death of a patient due to complications from a surgery he’d performed, he took his own life. I understood the guilt he must have experienced. But I’d also learned that in the battle between life and death, there were other forces at play. We may be the gatekeepers, but we were also human.

We had to remember that death was an inevitability. Even if we were technically excellent. Even if we were morally considerate, sometimes people die, as we all will.

Understanding this unwavering fact doesn’t mean we are weak or not committed to our responsibilities. It simply means we understand what we are up against and continue to forge our way through despite it. We might not always win, but we keep trying regardless.
