### Part I: Frankl’s time in concentration camps

Viktor Frankl survived 4 different concentration camps. He observed that the prisoners went through 3 general psychological phases:

- When they were admitted into the camps, most of them suffered from shock.
    - Shock manifested as delusions of reprieve, and abnormal reactions to the circumstances, such as humor, morbid curiosity, and lack of fear.
- Once the prisoners became entrenched in camp life, they fell into a state of apathy.
    - Apathy is the deadening of our emotional responses. This created a protective shell and allowed the prisoners to suffer intensely horrific conditions without losing their minds.
- After the prisoners were liberated, they experienced depersonalization.
    - During depersonalization, you feel disconnected from your thoughts, your body, and yourself. You view yourself from the outside, or feel as if you’re dreaming and not truly present. The conditions of the camps forced the prisoners to detach from themselves, and it was difficult to repair this even after they were free.

Despite the horrifying environment, Frankl noticed that the prisoners who were more likely to survive the concentration camps had **specific psychological methods of resistance**: rich inner lives, future-oriented goals, and discovery of meaning in their suffering.

- Prisoners who were less likely to survive found their suffering meaningless, and eventually succumbed to hopelessness--they weren’t convinced they had any reason to _try_ to survive, so they gave up mentally and physically.

We are all subject to external forces that can change our lives, whether they’re positive or negative forces. But the one thing we always possess, regardless of external circumstances, is our **freedom to choose how we respond to our circumstances**. We are in control of our perspective, our choices, and what we make of the situation we find ourselves in.

### Part II: Logotherapy

Frankl survived the concentration camps, and what he witnessed in them inspired the invention of logotherapy, a school of psychology which asserts that **meaning is the driving force in human life**, rather than pleasure, as Sigmund Freud believed, or power, as Alfred Adler believed.

Logotherapy focuses on taking action that aligns with your meaning in life. One method of doing this is the idea of **looking back on your deathbed at your choices**--would you be happy with them, and would you feel they fulfilled a purpose that was important to you?

Logotherapy suggests 3 different paths to finding your meaning:

- Through achievements and accomplishments, creating works of value or doing deeds.
- Through experiencing positive things like love or the beauty of nature.
- Through suffering, which can be a major human accomplishment if we can find meaning in it.
    - For instance, parents who work hard jobs to give their children a better life have found a meaning in their suffering.

We can do 3 things to find meaning in our suffering.

- Change personal suffering into personal triumphs through changing the view we take of our suffering.
- Use guilt from past decisions to help us change our future decisions for the better.
- Use the fact that we’ll die one day to inspire us to act responsibly and make good decisions.

People often get frustrated with existence, and the search for meaning can cause us some anxiety. Logotherapy addresses 2 forms of anxiety:

- Hyper-intention on something you want, which usually prevents you from achieving your desired goal precisely because you’re trying to force it to happen.
    - For instance, when you wake up in the middle of the night and try to force yourself to go back to sleep, very often the hyper-intention to sleep causes you to stay up longer.
- Anticipatory anxiety, where your fear of something happening usually causes it to happen.
    - For instance, someone who’s self-conscious about sweating too much when they’re nervous will get nervous, start to sweat, then get anxious about sweating too much, which increases their stress level and causes them to sweat _more._

Logotherapy has 2 techniques to deal with those forms of anxiety:

- For hyper-intention, try dereflection, where by focusing on something bigger than or outside of yourself, you inadvertently achieve your goals.
- For anticipatory anxiety, try paradoxical intention, where you try to do the thing you’re scared of doing, which usually short circuits the issue and frees you from it.
