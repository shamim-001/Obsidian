## Part 2: Applying the Principles | Chapter 4: Use Your Imagination to Create Success

In the previous part, we learned how crucial your self-image is to your happiness and success. This is due to the influence it has on whether or not you pursue your goals, via its influence on your subconscious. We also learned that Maltz uses the process of hypnotism to argue that your self-image is not a real thing. It’s simply a construct of thoughts you chose to think about past experiences: thoughts that often don’t reflect reality because they’re fuelled by your imagination.

Maltz concludes from all of this that **since your self-image is a result of hypnotization and imagination, you can use your imagination to “dehypnotize” yourself and improve your self-image.** The more you improve your self-image, the more you improve the way your subconscious is programmed to act.

In this chapter, we’ll explore how you can use your imagination to replace negative thoughts and feelings with positive ones to reprogram your self-image. Next, we’ll discuss the benefits of mental practice and visualization, and how you can effectively hypnotize yourself into acting more successfully. Finally, we’ll briefly outline the process you need to follow to change your self-image.

### Use Your Imagination to Reprogram Your Self-Image

Maltz argues that the first step to reprogramming your self-image is becoming conscious of whether you’re using your imagination constructively (to create positive thoughts and feelings) or deconstructively (to create negative thoughts and feelings).

If you’re using your imagination deconstructively, Maltz argues that you need to make a conscious effort to instead use it to form a clear mental picture of yourself as successful—this will allow you to practice feeling successful, and will ultimately improve your approach to life. To replace existing negative beliefs with new successful beliefs, you need to create equally strong impressions in your mind—that is, you need to create positive feelings of excitement and desire. **These positive feelings must outweigh your negative feelings so that your self-image can take notice of them and begin to accept them.**

- For example, you have a job interview coming up. You start to worry about all of the bad things that could happen. The more you think about these bad things, the more anxious you feel. You create such a strong impression in your mind associating your anxious feelings with the job interview. The result is that as soon as you think of your job interview, your mind immediately imagines a negative outcome—your subconscious expects you to feel anxious and uncomfortable at this job interview. To reverse this, you need to create a strong positive impression in your mind so that _your subconscious expects you to feel_ confident and successful at this job interview.

> **How to Shift Your Negative Thoughts to Positive Thoughts**
> 
> Maltz argues that you must imagine positive feelings that outweigh your negative feelings so that they can create a strong enough impression to replace your unwanted beliefs. However, when you’re in a state of anxiety or fear, [it’s not so easy to jump to a positive thought](https://newsletter.thementalhealthupdate.com/issues/why-forcing-yourself-to-feel-better-now-doesn-t-work-219025). This is because your thoughts and your state of mind reinforce one another to create an internal feedback loop that’s difficult to break out of:
> 
> - **Your thoughts determine your state of mind**: You think about the worst-case scenario so you feel anxious.
>     
> - **Your state of mind determines your thoughts**: You feel anxious so you think about the worst-case scenario.
>     
> 
> Further complicating the negative-to-positive switch is that, according to [Abraham Hicks](https://www.abraham-hicks.com/), your emotions aren’t just positive or negative—they’re a lot more complex than that. The [emotional guidance scale](https://www.intheopposite.com/emotionalscale) lists 22 categories of emotions, ranging from despair to joy, to effectively describe your state of mind and the kinds of thoughts and feelings you’re “attracting.”
> 
> Hicks argues that it’s impossible to jump from very negative emotions to very positive emotions, or vice-versa. If you want to think and feel more positive, you need to identify what you’re feeling and make a conscious effort to release your negative feelings, and move up the scale of emotions one step at a time.
> 
> For example, imagine that you’re aware that you’re worried about a job interview. Hicks suggests that you first need to let go of your worries (imagining the worst-case scenario) and let yourself feel doubt. Next, you need to release your feelings of doubt (questioning whether you’re capable) and let yourself feel disappointment (you’re disappointed with yourself for feeling insecure), and so on until you eventually move towards more positive emotions.

#### Science Shows That Mental Practice Improves Your Skills as Much as Real Practice

Visualization is a vital step to changing your self-image because when you form a clear mental picture of how you intend to perform and how successful you’ll feel, you can improve your skills almost as much as if you really practice. Maltz provides scientific evidence that supports the benefits of using your imagination to practice the feeling of success: he cites one research experiment that analyzed the effect of mental practice on improving basketball free throws. The first group of participants practiced throwing the ball every day. The second group of participants only imagined throwing the ball into the hoop every day. The results revealed that after 20 days, the group engaged in physical practice had improved by 24%, whereas the group engaged _only_ in mental practice improved by 23%.

This experiment helps explain why elite athletes and musicians often place as much emphasis on their mental training as they do on their physical training.

(Shortform note: This research has held up well over time. A 2018 study tested the effectiveness of mental practice on basketball free throws: The results confirmed that [mental practice does significantly improve participants’ motor skills and their ability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329740660_Comparison_of_Physical_and_Mental_Practice_on_Acquisition_of_Free_Basketball_Shot) to successfully make the shot. However, mental practice doesn’t _always_ lead to success, especially when [people find it difficult to imagine performing a task successfully](https://thepianoprof.com/5-reasons-you-dont-do-mental-practice/)—one reason for this difficulty could be that they’re not giving themselves enough sensory material to use—they attempt to use their imagination to practice things that they haven’t practiced in reality. For mental practice to be effective, you need to have _first_ practiced the skill in reality in order to form the correct mental picture and feeling to practice in your mind.)

### The Process to Change Your Self-Image Using Your Imagination

Maltz explains that changing your self-image uses the same machine-like process you follow to successfully achieve any goal:

1. **Focus** on the end result (feeling successful) and let your subconscious mind find the way.
2. **Understand** that your subconscious mind is impersonal (like a machine). It will work to achieve the goals that your self-image sets for it. If your self-image presents it with positive goals, it will move you towards success. However, if your self-image presents it with negative goals, it will move you towards failure. **You must visualize and feel what you want internally before you can experience it in reality**—your subconscious will produce results that are consistent with your self-image.
3. **Remember** that your mistakes are necessary steps in the learning process— they help direct you towards your goal by providing necessary feedback. Analyze your mistakes so that they help you to understand how to move towards your goal (like a machine processes negative feedback). Then forget your mistakes (don’t focus on them) and focus on where you intend to go. If you don’t forget them, your subconscious might interpret your mistakes as goals to move towards.
4. **Relax** as much as possible throughout this process and trust it to work for you. The more relaxed you are, the more likely your subconscious accepts the positive goals you set it to work on.

> **The Success Process According to the Law of Attraction**
> 
> Maltz’s ideas and techniques continue to inform and inspire self-help practitioners, motivational gurus, and sports psychologists. Some self-help practitioners use his techniques to present an entirely different premise to _Psycho-Cybernetics_. For example, Law of Attraction practitioners claim that _the universe creates your reality according to your thoughts,_ and amend Maltz’s process as follows:
> 
> - **Focus** on the end result (what you want) and let **the universe** find the way.
>     
> - **Understand** that the universe is impersonal. It will deliver things that match your frequency. **You must visualize and feel what you want internally before you can experience it in reality**—the universe can’t produce results that are inconsistent with your frequency.
>     
> - **Remember** that you get what you focus on—if you focus on what you don’t want (your mistakes and limitations), the universe will interpret this as an instruction to deliver more disappointing experiences. Knowing what you don’t want is only useful for providing signals about what you do want—only ever focus on what you do want.
>     
> - **Relax** as much as possible and trust that the universe is on your side. The more relaxed you are, the more likely the universe is to respond to your positive suggestions.
>     
> 
> While both Maltz and Law of Attraction practitioners assert that how you perceive yourself impacts your reality, there’s an important distinction between the two theories: Maltz encourages you to **take action**, whereas the Law of Attraction encourages you to **be passive**.
> 
> **_Active_**: Maltz encourages you to change your inner life so that **you can feel motivated and take actions that lead you to success**. You’re instructed to visualize and practice being the person **you want to be.** Your goal is to align your thoughts, emotions, and desires, so that you can become a better version of yourself and “act” successfully.
> 
> **_Passive_**: The Law of Attraction encourages you to change your inner life so that **you can trust that success will come to you**. Your goal is to align your thoughts, emotions, and desires, with what you want so that you can “attract” objects and experiences into your reality.
> 
> While both Maltz and the Law of Attraction promote psychological well-being (positive thinking does make you feel better and reduce stress), it’s ultimately up to readers to interpret and act on the information—they decide if and how to take action to improve their lives.
