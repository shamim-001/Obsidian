## Chapter 8-9: The Power of Compassion

So far we’ve been mostly discussing mindfulness, or awareness of our moment-to-moment experiences. **However, it’s important to remember that the second part of Radical Acceptance is compassion.**

Chapter 8 begins to discuss compassion in earnest: what it is, and how we can cultivate it in our own lives. Then, in Chapter 9 we start exploring how to bring that same openness and empathy to other peoples’ experiences.

### What Is Compassion?

The word _compassion_ means “to feel with.” **Compassion is when we respond to pain—our own or someone else’s—with tenderness and love.** It goes directly against our societal conditioning, which tells us to run from pain. However, compassion allows us to embrace our experiences instead of constantly fighting against them. Far from avoiding pain, we have to intentionally focus our attention on it in order to cultivate compassion.

Pain, whether physical or emotional, can create an insidious trap. When we’re suffering, we tend to blame ourselves for it. Someone might tell himself that his back hurts because he doesn’t take proper care of himself, or that his relationship fell apart because he wasn’t attentive enough. This puts us into the trance of unworthiness. **It also makes having compassion for ourselves difficult, because we feel like we deserve to suffer.**

For many of us, offering compassion to others comes easily, but offering it to ourselves feels self-indulgent or even shameful. We might feel like we’re being needy, or that we don’t deserve to treat ourselves with compassion.

However, in many cases, compassion is necessary for emotional and spiritual healing. Meeting our own pain with compassion can start to undo the social conditioning that makes us feel ashamed. When we’re blocking out painful experiences, compassion helps to bring down the walls.

In Buddhism, we usually begin by being aware of our own pain. Once we’re able to respond to our own pain with compassion, we’ll be more open to meeting others with that same compassion. However, as we’ve said, some people find the opposite to be true; it’s easier for them to have compassion for others first, and then to bring that same attention to their own experiences. **Either way, relating to pain with love instead of resistance is how we awaken compassion within ourselves.**

As always, physical experiences are a good place to begin. Consider how your pain is manifesting. Even if it’s emotional distress, draw your attention to how it _feels_. For example: is your heart racing, or your stomach upset? Where are you holding tension in your body? These are the same kind of mindfulness exercises we’ve discussed before.

**The next step is to meet that suffering with compassion.** We can say to ourselves, “I care about this pain. May this pain kindle compassion.” It’ll probably feel strange at first, or even embarrassing—we aren’t used to offering ourselves compassion in this way. However, by continuing to practice compassion for our own pain, we can start to let go of our own pains and the insecurities that come with them.

The vulnerable parts of ourselves need comfort and support, so by offering that to ourselves we can find a new sense of openness and awareness. Instead of protecting ourselves by withdrawing, curling inward to protect ourselves, we can find the strength and security to open up to the world around us instead.

A side note: Holding ourselves with love and compassion doesn’t free us from responsibility for our actions. However, it _does_ free us from the self-judgment and self-hatred that prevents us from responding with clarity and understanding. **Remember the core of Radical Acceptance: We must understand and accept our experiences without being ruled by them.**

#### Widening our Awareness

**There may be times when our pain or shame is too great to face alone.** This is especially the case when our actions have harmed others. When we know that we’ve played a part in another’s suffering, it’s hard to believe that we deserve to feel better. When that’s the case, we often have to widen our awareness in order to hold the pain without it destroying us.

One of Brach’s students, a woman named Marian, found herself in such a position. She’d lost herself in alcoholism to cope with the pain of a messy divorce. As a result, Marian wasn’t aware that her new husband had been sneaking into her daughter’s room and sexually assaulting her while Marian was drunk or asleep downstairs.

When she finally learned what had been happening, Marian tormented herself with guilt and self-reproach. The pain and shame of knowing that she’d allowed her daughter to suffer so much seemed unbearable. Finally, Marian sought help from a former teacher of hers, a Jesuit priest.

The priest advised her that she was living in a place of pain. That place couldn’t be avoided, and there was no sense in trying to run or hide from it. However, if possible, she should try to remember that there was also a much greater place, the kingdom of God, which could hold both her pain and the love she needed to heal.

This story is reminiscent of the young Siddhartha Gautama, who sat watching the farmers work. Much as he realized that the world is big enough to hold both suffering and joy, Marian’s first step to healing was recognizing that the world (or, in her case, God) was big enough to hold both pain and love.

It might seem like the priest’s answer of seeking refuge in God is only applicable to Christians, or others who follow God-centered religions. However, we all tend to reach out to greater forces during difficult times. Someone suffering from a terrible headache might beg for the pain to stop, or someone who desperately wants something might plead for it to happen. We do this even if we don’t know who or what we’re asking for help—maybe we give this unspecified presence a label like “the universe.” No matter who or what we reach out to, the reason is the same: We feel alone, and we want the pain of isolation to end.

When we combine mindfulness practices with this type of reaching out, we can practice _mindful prayer_. With mindful prayer we reach both outward and inward: **We look outward for help, support, and love, and we look inward to listen to the suffering that’s provoking our prayer.** In doing so, we become both the one who is suffering and the one who offers compassion.

Mindful prayer allows us to touch our fear and our pain without getting lost in trances of judgment and feelings of unworthiness. Marian, the woman who didn’t know her daughter was being abused, found compassion that could hold both her pain and her daughter’s pain by practicing mindful prayer.

Like any kind of spiritual practice, mindful prayer becomes more powerful the more we practice it. Whenever we feel our hurts and our fears creeping in, we can reach both outward and inward. **In doing so, we can accept the pain and use it as a gateway to compassion.**

### Compassion for Others

**Compassion grows in circles.** For example, we might start by finding compassion for our closest friends and family. From there, we could expand our compassion to include people we see, but may not know very well: Our friends’ parents, for example, or the people we regularly see at the gym or in classes. In embracing compassion, we might start to recognize how many people around us suffer with the same fears, insecurities, and pain that we do.

The final step is extending your awareness and compassion without limit—caring for everyone who’s suffering anywhere in the world, everyone who feels alone and afraid. This kind of awareness and compassion helps us as well; it reminds us that there’s nothing wrong with us when we feel hurt or scared; it’s simply part of being human.

In Buddhism, a _bodhisattva_ is someone who could enter Nirvana (paradise), but chooses to stay on Earth and help others reach it instead. A bodhisattva is the embodiment of selflessness: Someone who forgoes ultimate happiness in order to help others find it. While many of us may not have the chance to enter Nirvana in our lifetimes, **we can aspire to similar levels of compassion by continually growing our own circles.**

#### The Illusion of the “Other”

**When we’re caught up in our own stories, everyone else tends to become “other.”** They seem separate from us, different, not quite real. We start assigning them roles, as if they’re characters in a show: Some are allies, some are enemies, and most of them don’t matter to us at all.

The more different people seem from us, the less real they tend to feel. It becomes easy to dismiss anyone of a different race, religion, or socioeconomic background. We focus on superficial aspects of people and assign them labels.

Those labels could be complimentary, like “star,” or even “hero.” However, they can also be derogatory, like “bum,” or “alcoholic.” Sometimes the labels are less concrete and more to do with behavior, like “boring,” “needy,” or “pushy.” By labeling people this way, we make it easier to view them as _other_.

Once we start seeing someone as a label, and not a real person with real feelings, we don’t consider their pain anymore. **At this point we don’t just ignore them; we can hurt them without feeling anything ourselves.** This method of other-ing people is what leads a father to disown his gay son, or a patriot to cheer when people on the other side of a war die.

This sense of “other” has its roots in biology. We’re programmed to look for members of our own group and shun those who look, or act, or even smell different. These habits used to help us keep ourselves and our relatives alive, and it’s a powerful instinct even in modern times.

However, it’s possible to lower our defenses. We can expand our idea of what our “group” is, enlarging it in the widening circles we discussed before. Doing so is another type of Radical Acceptance—accepting others as they are, without inventing stories or passing judgment. This is also key to feeling compassion like a bodhisattva does; a bodhisattva sees the entire world as his or her group.

There’s an old Sikh story that demonstrates what it means to see everything—not just all humans, but all living things—as real. In the story, an old master calls his two most faithful students to attend him. He gives each of them a chicken, and tells them to go someplace where nobody can see them and to kill the chicken.

One student immediately obeys. He goes behind a shed and slaughters the bird. The other walks around for hours, and eventually returns with the chicken still alive. He tells the master that his task was impossible, for there was nowhere he could go that the chicken wouldn’t see. **The second student saw the chicken as a real being.**

### Reopening Our Hearts

There will be times when even the people we’re closest to make us feel imposed upon, frustrated, scared, or disgusted. That doesn’t mean that we’re failing as compassionate beings, it just means that we need to turn our attention and our Radical Acceptance inward again. **We need to understand and have compassion for our own experience.** Then we can move outward and have compassion for the other person’s experience.

We may often find that our negative response toward this other person is because we’ve distanced ourselves from him or her. We may have accidentally reduced the other person to a label like “student” or “mother.” Practicing Radical Acceptance on our own reactions, and then expanding that compassion to encompass the other person, will allow us to engage with and care for that person.

**Compassion for others often begins with the question “what do they need?”** Practicing asking this question—both to ourselves and others—helps to get us away from our own needs and to act from a place of true compassion. For example, perhaps all someone really needs at a given moment is to be heard and understood. Someone who wants to be seen as helpful and competent might listen to that person, but then offer advice where it’s not wanted. Even if her intentions are good, she’s acting based on her needs rather than the other person’s.

However, compassion can go beyond just understanding another person’s needs. Imagining yourself in another person’s shoes is the very heart of compassion—what would it be like to inhabit that person’s mind and body, to exist in his or her circumstances?

There’s a psychological technique called _role reversal_ that’s designed to encourage this type of compassion. For example, say that a husband and wife were having marital difficulties. Role reversal would begin with one of them—perhaps the wife—describing her current experiences; how she perceives and feels about her current situation. Then the husband would pretend to be the wife, and try to speak from her perspective about those same issues. Next, the process would repeat with the focus on the husband’s experiences.

Role reversal is a formalized method of getting ourselves out of our own heads and into another person’s, as much as possible. However, we don’t have to go through that entire process every time we try to have compassion for someone else. It’s often enough to simply imagine what the other person may be thinking or feeling, and to consider how we could help.
