## Chapters 1-3: The Emotional Basis of Negotiation

Voss argues that negotiation triggers fear and anxiety in many people. We worry about getting outmaneuvered by the other side, about not having enough information to make informed decisions, and about deadlines that pressure us into making bad deals. We also think that negotiation is something reserved for high-powered businesspeople and lawyers—not ordinary people like us.

But according to Voss, this is false. Negotiating is something we do every day. In fact, **negotiation is taking place whenever you want something from someone else.** It can be the major scenarios (buying a car, renting an apartment) but it can also be typical, daily stuff like getting your partner to take out the garbage.

In these chapters, Voss breaks down the mystique around negotiating by highlighting:

- How people’s emotional need for a feeling of security and autonomy drives most negotiation
- Tactics to put your counterpart at ease, make them feel safe, and extract crucial information that will put you in a dominant position in the negotiation

### Guided by Emotions

Voss’s core thesis of negotiation is that **we as human beings** **are all inherently irrational and impulsive**—willing to make decisions with incomplete information and disregard for our own basic material interests if the decision satisfies a deeper emotional need. He argues that most people have two basic emotional needs:

- To feel secure
- To feel in control

Successful negotiations, then, must navigate these basic emotional truths. As Voss discovered in the course of his career as a hostage negotiator, getting what you want from someone else—which, after all, is the standard for success in any negotiation—is more about heart than mind: You need to ask yourself emotion-questions to try and get a mental blueprint for how your counterpart thinks:

- What are their real desires?
- What do they fear losing the most?
- How can I show them that _my_ preferred outcome will lead to _their_ preferred outcome?

> **The Rider and the Elephant: A Metaphor for Reason and Emotion**
> 
> Other writers have emphasized just how much emotion—not reason—drives our behavior. In _[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/1-page-summary)_ (2006), author Jonathan Haidt uses the metaphor of a human rider sitting atop an elephant to illustrate how the human mind works. The rider, representing reason, can do her best to attempt to direct the elephant. But the elephant, representing emotion, is far more powerful and has its own will; it will only comply with the rider’s commands if those commands are not in conflict with its desires. Thus, the rational part of ourselves can advise and guide our emotional core—but in a pure contest of wills, emotion will nearly always defeat reason.
> 
> This metaphor closely tracks Voss’s view of human nature, as he argues that emotion is the primary influence over our behavior. As Voss goes on to argue, your negotiating success hinges on understanding the power of emotion to overwhelm reason—and harnessing that power to get what you want from your counterpart, just as a rider harnesses an elephant.

### Rejecting Old-School Negotiation Theory

This emotion-based theory of negotiation promoted by Voss stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by other writers in the field. What Voss describes as _“_old-school_,”_ classic negotiation theory is premised on the idea that human beings are inherently rational. They are able to calculate what their optimal outcome is, with each step in the negotiation designed to bring them closer to that outcome. This school of thought imagines humans to be like computers, evaluating comparative advantages and disadvantages and making decisions based solely on those calculations.

Voss cites Roger Fisher and William Ury’s _[Getting to Yes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-to-yes)_ as a classic of the genre. He says that Fisher and Ury’s theory holds that in negotiations, two parties engage in a mutual act of problem-solving, each of them trying to get to a “win-win” settlement that pleases both parties.

Win-win is based on compromise. It stipulates that negotiating counterparts should just look for common ground and seek terms that they can both live with. Voss writes that we’re taught from an early age to resolve disputes this way—compromising, meeting in the middle, and splitting the difference. For example, if someone is trying to sell you something for $2 and you only want to spend $1, you split the difference and pay $1.50 for the item.

On some level, Voss concedes, this _feels_ fair and reasonable. Plus, it’s much _easier_ to do this than really put in the effort to build a deep connection with the other person. However, Voss counters, real negotiations are seldom this cut-and-dry. For starters, some negotiations really are win-lose, zero-sum scenarios where an equitable and mutually beneficial solution is impossible—a win for the other person can _only_ mean a loss for you. In an election between two candidates, for example, only one person can win—a vote for one means one fewer possible vote for the other. There’s no room for compromise, because it’s winner-take-all.

Besides, Voss writes, in real-world negotiations people are so overcome by emotion and impulse that they struggle to even _identify_ what constitutes a “win” for them, let alone work with someone _else_ to achieve one.

Instead of rational interest, argues Voss, you must learn to tap into your counterpart’s hidden reservoir of _emotions_, _desires_, and _anxieties_ that truly drive their surface-level behavior.

> **Fisher and Ury on Emotion**
> 
> Although Voss frames Fisher and Ury’s approach in _Getting to Yes_ as overly rational and clinical, those authors do acknowledge the role that emotion plays in influencing our desires and perceptions.
> 
> Fisher and Ury argue that successful negotiators don’t ignore emotion—rather, they _defuse_ emotions that hinder discussion. They encourage you to talk openly with your counterpart about your emotions and theirs. Critically, they urge that you acknowledge the other person’s emotions as legitimate and allow them to vent, but that you not react to an emotional outburst—instead, you should just sit and listen. With emotions thus acknowledged, say Fisher and Ury, negotiations can be less reactive and more proactive and people can more easily focus on the substantive issues at hand.
> 
> This empathy-first approach shares some similarities with Voss’s theory of negotiation. Ury and Fisher do not discount the importance of emotion, as Voss sometimes alleges they do. Indeed, they write that emotion must be acknowledged openly. They do, however, argue that emotions must be overcome so that both parties can move to a more substantive and rational negotiation.

### Calculated Empathy: Make Them Feel Safe

Instead of “old-school” methods, Voss champions **calculated empathy—understanding someone _else’s_ feelings for the purpose of getting what _you_ want from them**.

Calculated empathy gives you insight into why someone is behaving the way they are. Once you have this understanding, it’s easier for you to display empathy to the other person. And once you reveal yourself to be an open-minded person who is willing to listen and who understands their perspective, your counterpart will begin to loosen up and feel more comfortable with you. According to Voss, **they will come to feel emotionally safe with you—seeing you more as a _partner_ than an _adversary_.** This will make them far more willing to grant you access to their innermost thought processes and hidden desires—where the most valuable information lies.

And this is critical, because as Voss argues, your secret weapon in any negotiation is the quality of information you have. In fact, **all negotiations are exercises in information-gathering.** If the person on the other side of the table is driven by their emotional need for security and autonomy, your job is to figure out how you can take advantage of those needs to get them to reveal information that will give you the upper hand.

> **Empathy Leads to Emotional Intelligence**
> 
> Other writers have explored the crucial role of empathy in human interaction. In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence)_, Daniel Goleman argues that empathy is one of the five core components of emotional intelligence, which he says may be more important to a person’s ultimate success in life than their intelligence quotient or IQ.
> 
> According to Goleman, empathy is the fundamental skill that allows us to interpret what others want or need. Empathy changes the way we look at the world: When other people are in pain, you work to understand their pain and help them through it. You also work to not _cause_ people pain. Goleman argues that this is the essential root of all human morality—in other words, empathy makes you a better person.
> 
> Goleman writes that you can develop greater empathy by taking into account other people’s perspective and backgrounds and considering how that might influence their thoughts and behaviors.

Voss outlines five main tactics you can use to achieve calculated empathy:

- Listen actively
- Use the right tone
- Reflect back
- Label
- Anticipate accusations

#### Tactic #1: Listen Actively

According to Voss, _active listening_ is a set of tools that skilled negotiators use to disarm their counterparts. It means making it clear to the other person that you’re truly hearing and understanding them.

**Too often, we are only _passively_ listening. We might be literally hearing the sounds of the other person’s words, but we’re not properly engaged with their _thinking_ and their _concerns_.** That means we’re missing important information and squandering an opportunity to show our counterpart that we care about what they have to say.

According to Voss, you can project active listening by talking slowly and calmly to show that you’re _concerned_ about how they feel. In contrast, Voss urges the reader to think about how it feels when someone (like a salesperson or a politician in a televised debate) bombards you with lots of information all at once. You feel overwhelmed, not in control, and like they’re trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Voss describes this sensation as feeling like the other person cares more about what _they’re_ saying than about listening to _your_ concerns.

(Shortform note: Although Voss invokes a salesperson to demonstrate the failure to listen actively, sales experts increasingly encourage active listening. In _[Way of the Wolf: Straight Line Selling](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/way-of-the-wolf)_ author Jordan Belfort argues that, in order to boost your sales output, it’s critical to practice active listening with prospects. Belfort writes that even small active listening gestures—like nodding your head, smiling, looking in your prospect’s eyes, and occasionally adding in short phrases like, “Got it” or “I see”—will make your prospect feel as if you are listening to them, and also help you from spacing out and reverting back to passive listening.)

#### Tactic #2: Use the Right Tone

Voss also argues that _tone_ is crucial to calculated empathy. He writes that using different tones of voice can be like flipping an emotional switch that gets people cooperative and relaxed. According to Voss, there are three main negotiating voices to use:

- **Upbeat**: This is a positive, welcoming voice. Voss says **this should be your default tone** because it’s effective at putting people at ease (which is precisely where you want them when you’re negotiating).
- **Soothing**: This is a calm, slow, reassuring voice, with a downward inflection. Voss says he used this one often during his career as an FBI hostage negotiator because it kept hostage-takers from becoming rattled and engaging in impulsive (and thus, dangerous) behavior.
- **Domineering**: This is a dominant and authoritative voice. Voss points out that many people _think_ that this is the key to negotiation, but they’re wrong. Browbeating the other party is rarely successful. **This tone should only be used in very select cases, because it has a high likelihood of backfiring.**

> **Gender and Tone**
> 
> The evidence seems to bear out Voss’s argument that tone can be crucial to achieving your goals, even in non-negotiation situations—and that using the wrong tone can lead to unfortunate consequences.
> 
> In a 2018 _New York Times_ article, Jessica Bennett pointed out that [words like “shrill” are used twice as often in media to refer to women than men](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/us/gender-letter-women-voices-high-pitched.html)—and that this highly gendered vocal criticism may have played a role in the ultimate failure of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy in 2016.
> 
> And in a 2018 BBC article, David Robson writes that [women today speak at a measurably lower pitch than they did in the 1940s and 1950s](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180612-the-reasons-why-womens-voices-are-deeper-today). Comparative research that studied audio recordings of female voices from Australia in 1945 with female voices from the 1990s found that there was a drop of 23 Hz over five decades, from an average of 229 Hz to 206 Hz—which, he argues, is an audible difference in tone and pitch.
> 
> The researchers cited by Robson suggest that the deepening of female voices over the 20th century (and likely into the 21st century) may be a result of the influx of women into traditionally male-dominated social and economic roles over that time. This may have led them over time to adopt a deeper tone in an effort to put themselves on equal footing with their male colleagues—suggesting that, as Voss argues, adapting your tone can be an effective strategy for getting what you want.

#### Tactic #3: Reflect Back

**Voss cites _reflecting back_ as one of the most effective psychological tactics you can use. Essentially, it is imitation and repetition**. You repeat the last three words that the person has said in your next sentence. It may sound simple, but there’s profound psychological meaning behind it.

Human beings are drawn to what’s similar and are distrustful of that which seems alien or different. **By imitating their speech patterns, you’re signaling to the other person not only that you’re hearing them, but also that you’re _like_ them**.

> **Reflecting Back Makes People Feel Familiarity**
> 
> Reflecting back is closely related to the concept of familiarity. We are more likely to be kindly disposed toward people who we believe to be similar to ourselves—and one way to display that familiarity is through imitation and repetition.
> 
> According to Robert Cialdini in _[Influence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/1-page-summary)_, this building of familiarity and rapport is closely connected to what he terms the Liking Principle—which stipulates that we’re more likely to comply with requests from people that we know and like, especially familiar figures like neighbors, friends, and family. Voss’s strategy of imitation makes sense when looked at from this perspective, because imitation is an easy way to establish rapport with another person—you’re literally copying what they're saying. According to Cialdini, someone who feels this sense of rapport or kinship is far more likely to comply with your requests, because the social costs of saying “no” to a friend or even an acquaintance are much higher than they are for a stranger.
> 
> And it makes sense, from an evolutionary and group cohesion perspective, why we would be more willing to comply with the wishes of people we know. Early human communities were extended kinship groups, where the survival of the individual was closely tied to the larger familial group. In this world of localized, tight-knit communities, helping people in your in-group was a valuable survival trait: you relied on them to help with the necessities of life, like food-gathering and child-rearing. The members of your kin group would also have probably been the _only_ people you actually encountered. Thus, there evolved a strong propensity to assist individuals who were personally known to us.

#### Tactic #4: Label

Voss identifies _labeling_ as another important calculated empathy technique. It’s **identifying and vocalizing someone else’s emotion.** This is a valuable shortcut to building intimacy, because it demonstrates insight and empathy on your part, builds essential rapport, and doesn’t require you to give up anything.

In order to label, you first need to _identify_ the other person’s emotions. This requires being perceptive and **on the lookout for physical and verbal cues**. Things like nervous hand gestures or sweating, for example, are telltale signs of anxiety.

Once you’ve figured out what they’re feeling, vocalize what they’re feeling back to them. Voss advises negotiators to **always phrase labels to begin with neutral, qualified, third-person statements** like, “It seems like,” “It looks like,” or “It sounds like.”

Starting with third-party labels also gives you some plausible deniability. If the other person says that your emotional labelling of their anger, for example, is incorrect, you can always respond with something like, “I didn’t say you were angry. I said it _seemed_ like you were angry.”

> **Labeling Empowers Us to Own Our Emotions**
> 
> Labeling others’ feelings can be useful in a negotiation, as Voss writes. But there might be good reasons for you to take it one step further. In _[Nonviolent Communication](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication)_, author Marshall Rosenberg writes that it’s also crucial to label your _own_ feelings as part of expressive nonviolent communication—a way of interacting with ourselves and others rooted in compassion and the conscious effort to avoid causing emotional harm.
> 
> Taking it a step further, Rosenberg argues that it’s important not only to identify _what_ you’re feeling, but _why_ you’re feeling it as well. It’s important to acknowledge that your feelings stem from your own needs and expectations—not necessarily the actions of others. Marshall identifies three ways we deny responsibility for our emotions:
> 
> - Using “it” and “that” to describe your reaction (like “That makes me nervous” or “It annoys me when you do that”), implying that something external is causing your feelings
>     
> - Using a pronoun other than “I” after the phrase “I feel this emotion because....” This looks like “I feel sad because he didn’t show up” or “I feel annoyed because she isn’t here yet.”
>     
> - Correctly labeling a feeling, but attributing it to someone or something else, like “When you forgot my birthday, I felt lonely.”
>     
> 
> Note that we can also apply Rosenberg’s insights to Voss’s practice of labeling. If you see that your counterpart is evading responsibility for their emotions by saying things like, “That makes me uncomfortable,” you can use labeling to force them to own their feelings and face them down by responding, “It sounds like you’re uncomfortable.”

#### Tactic #5: Anticipate Accusations

Voss writes that _anticipating accusations_ is a twist on labelling, in which you label your counterpart’s negative emotions—but about _you_ specifically. **When anticipating accusations, list every bad thing your counterpart could say about you at the beginning of the negotiation**. This defuses the situation immediately and puts it all right out there in the open.

This might sound like, “I know I didn’t hand in that sales report on time. You probably think I’m lazy, uncommitted, inattentive to detail, and that I don’t care about wasting your time or everybody else’s.”

According to Voss, you should then ask for input based on that list. This is where the tactic really works its magic. You’ll actually trigger _their_ innate human empathy by making them reassure _you_ that you’re not as bad as you’ve portrayed yourself. Your counterpart might respond to the above accusation audit by saying, “OK look, I don’t think you’re lazy or that you don’t care. This was definitely a mistake but let’s try and fix it.” Right away, you’ve reset the negotiating dynamic.

**We all have an inherent need to forge some kind of connection to the person across the table**. By anticipating their accusations, you’ve forced _them_ to make the next move in building that empathy.

(Shortform note: Although not specifically addressed by Voss, anticipating accusations could potentially be misused if you were to deliberately _mislabel_ someone else’s perceptions of yourself, thereby tricking them into expressing empathy for you under false pretenses. If you were to do this, some might find it to be dishonest and emotionally manipulative. By distorting their reality this way (for example, by painting a picture of yourself as being worse than you actually are), some might consider accusation audits to be gaslighting—a form of psychological manipulation in which you maneuver someone into questioning their perceptions of reality.)

### A Calculated Empathy Dialogue

To illustrate how these tactics might all play out together in a real-world scenario, we’ve created a brief dialogue between two coworkers (Paul and Jenna). Paul missed a very important meeting that Jenna had organized where they were meeting with a major prospective client for their company. Although the meeting went well without Paul, his absence meant that Jenna had to do the entire presentation by herself, which caused her a lot of stress and anxiety. In the dialogue below, we’ve explicitly labeled where each tactic is being used.

Paul (speaking in a light, empathetic tone): Hi Jenna. I heard you crushed it at the meeting with the Orient Point people yesterday. Great job taking them through the deck and answering all their questions. **(Tactic #2: Use the Right Tone)**

Jenna: Thanks for that Paul. It means a lot to me to hear that from you.

Paul: And look, I want to address me not being there. I had a childcare emergency—my daughter’s nanny had to leave early on short notice and my wife wasn’t able to come home to relieve her, so I had to leave work early. But I feel absolutely awful about leaving you in the lurch like that. After putting you in that position, I wouldn’t blame you one bit if you thought I was a completely uncaring, out-to-lunch, selfish colleague who has no respect for all the incredible work you do for the team. **(Tactic #5: Anticipating Accusations).**

Jenna. Look, we all have personal stuff that comes up and that can’t be helped. And for the record, no, I don’t think you’re a selfish or uncaring colleague. I just would’ve appreciated some kind of heads up before I went into that meeting having to carry it all on my shoulders.

Paul: I get that. **(Tactic #1: Listen Actively).** It sounds like you’re disappointed with what happened, and that’s totally ok and completely reasonable. **(Tactic #4: Label).** And you’re right, you shouldn’t ever have to carry it all on your shoulders. **(Tactic #3: Reflect Back).**

Jenna: I appreciate you saying that Paul, I really do. I’m glad it went well, and I’m excited to continue our partnership together.

Paul: Great, so am I!
