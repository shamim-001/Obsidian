## 1-Page Summary

It’s a simple fact that life’s full of problems and challenges that you’d rather avoid, such as dealing with irritating people or having a job you don’t enjoy. If you’re like most people, you probably assume that these experiences are to blame for negative feelings—and that the only way to make yourself feel better is to avoid such experiences.

But what if you’re going about this the wrong way? In _101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think_, bestselling author and poet Brianna Wiest argues that unwanted experiences aren’t to blame for your bad feelings, only your _thoughts_ about these experiences are. Therefore, there’s only one solution to make yourself feel better: Change the way you think.

This guide presents Wiest’s ideas in four parts:

- **Part #1** explains how your thoughts and feelings influence how you interpret your experiences.
- **Part #2** explores how social conditioning influences the way you _unconsciously_ think about yourself, other people, and your experiences.
- **Part #3** clarifies how you’ve been conditioned to ignore your own needs and instead seek external validation.
- **Part #4** presents methods to help you become more conscious of your thoughts so that you can learn to take control of them and improve the way that you feel.

### Part #1: Your Thoughts Determine How You Interpret Everything

Wiest argues that **the only way to change the way you _feel_ about the people and things that make you feel bad is to change the way you _think_ about them**. To understand her argument, you first need to grasp one key idea: There’s no such thing as an objective experience—meaning that there’s no one “right” way to interpret your experiences.

Wiest explains that no experience has inherent qualities of its own—such as being good, bad, right, or wrong. You only assign these values to them because of the way you think about and interpret them. Therefore, it’s not your experiences that determine how you feel, but your thoughts _about_ these experiences.

> **Your Thoughts _Create_ Your Experiences**
> 
> While many self-help authors mirror Wiest’s view that your thoughts determine how you interpret experiences, Norman Vincent Peale (_[The Power of Positive Thinking](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking)_) takes this idea one step further. He claims that [your thoughts aren’t only a response to your experiences, but are also the cause of your experiences](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking#we-create-our-own-obstacles). He explains that your thoughts during an experience determine how you react to it. This reaction shapes how subsequent experiences play out.
> 
> For example, consider how your thoughts during a heated discussion shape what happens next. When you think the other person is trying to upset you, you feel wronged and react defensively or aggressively—the discussion then turns to conflict. On the other hand, when you think the other person is simply expressing their opinion, you don’t take their words personally and find it easier to respond rationally. This helps ease the tension and keep you and the other person on friendly terms.

#### Feedback Loops Reinforce Your Thoughts and Feelings

Additionally, Wiest argues that it’s difficult to change the way you think and feel about what happens to you. This is because your thinking patterns lock you into a feedback loop that reinforces the way you interpret your experiences.

The following five-step process illustrates how feedback loops reinforce your thoughts and feelings:

1. **Your state of mind influences what types of thoughts you have.** For example, you’re experiencing stress so you have worrisome thoughts.
2. **Those thoughts influence the way you feel.** Your worrisome thoughts make you feel anxious and this increases your stress levels.
3. **Your feelings determine what you pay attention to.** Your feelings of anxiety compel you to focus disproportionately on things that are going wrong in your life. As a result, you engage in more worrisome thoughts and further increase your stress levels.
4. **What you pay attention to determines how you interpret and judge your experiences.** Your focus on what’s going wrong in your life leads you to judge your experiences as difficult or problematic—because it blocks you from perceiving what’s going well in your life.
5. **Your judgments reinforce how you feel, what you think, and your state of mind.** Because you’re judging your experiences as problematic, you continue to feel anxious and you believe that you have a reason to experience stress. As a result, you continue to interpret everything that happens from this negative perspective.

> **How Unconscious Biases Reinforce Feedback Loops**
> 
> Psychological research expands upon Wiest’s description of the interpretation process by explaining that your habitual thoughts and feelings are influenced and reinforced by [cognitive biases](https://www.verywellmind.com/cognitive-biases-distort-thinking-2794763). Cognitive biases are the result of your brain’s attempt to make quick judgments based on your past experiences, and they shape the way you think about and perceive your environment.
> 
> There are many different types of cognitive biases, and each of them influences your perception in different ways. The most common forms are [confirmation bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias), the tendency to pay more attention to the information that confirms and reinforces your opinion, and [negativity bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618), the tendency to notice and dwell on the negative aspects of your experience.
> 
> The example in the five-step process above demonstrates how both of these biases reinforce how you feel, what you think, and your state of mind: The confirmation bias influences you to only notice and interpret experiences that reinforce your feelings of anxiety. Likewise, the negativity bias keeps you focused on what you dislike or fear about your experiences. As a result, you find it difficult to disentangle yourself from your stressful state of mind, think differently, and ease your feelings of anxiety.

#### Your Thoughts Shape Your View of the Past and Future

Wiest claims that this process of interpretation isn’t limited to the present moment. Your thoughts also impact the way you experience memories of the past or expectations for the future—because you project your current state of mind onto whatever you think about. This explains why your feelings about the past or future often fluctuate depending on your current mood.

(Shortform note: The psychological term “[mood-congruency](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-young-and-the-restless/201411/case-the-malleable-memory)” explains why memories and expectations change according to your mood. You rely on your imagination to construct your memories and expectations. However, your emotions and imagination are inextricably linked—meaning that your current emotions determine the emotional content of your recollections or expectations.)

### Part #2: You’re Not Conscious of Your Thoughts or Why You Think Them

Since everything you experience is simply a reflection of the way you think, it follows then, that to experience things differently, you just need to change your thoughts. However, Wiest argues, before you can change your thoughts, you first need to become _conscious_ of them and understand _why_ you currently think the way that you do. In this second part of the guide, we’ll explain why you don’t have complete autonomy over the way you think and how this impacts the way you interpret your experiences, how you experience happiness, and how you judge yourself.

(Shortform note: Many self-help practitioners agree that [understanding why you think the way that you do is the key to changing your thoughts](https://shortform.com/app/book/as-a-man-thinketh/take-control-of-your-thoughts). Without this understanding, you’re more likely to believe that your thoughts are entirely rational (because your experiences _justify_ your thoughts), and you won’t feel motivated to change the way that you think about or interpret your experiences.)

#### You Subconsciously Think Like Others To Feel Happy

While you might believe that you consciously control your thoughts, Wiest claims that you’re often _not_ conscious of your thoughts or why you think them. This is because **you never consciously _chose_ the thoughts you habitually think or the beliefs that reinforce them**. Rather, you subconsciously adopted the thoughts and beliefs of your family, your friends, and your culture.

According to Wiest, these adopted thoughts and beliefs influence your entire worldview—how you judge the world, your place in it, and the circumstances you face. In other words, everything you’ve ever thought of as good, bad, right, wrong, beautiful, or ugly has simply been a reflection of the way other people have influenced you.

Why would you adopt the thoughts of those around you? According to Wiest, you likely found early on in life that it was the only way you could experience comfort and happiness. She explains that, as a child, your comfort and happiness depended on conforming to the expectations of other people:

- If you acted according to their desires and expectations, you were rewarded—for example, with extra attention and affection. This made you feel comfortable and happy.
- If you acted against their desires and expectations, you were punished—for example, with rejection or social humiliation. This made you feel uncomfortable and unhappy.

(Shortform note: Researchers confirm that we unconsciously internalize the unspoken rules and biases of our social groups so that we can instinctively cooperate with others. [Our inherent need to feel connected to others and to avoid punishment motivates us to adopt these rules](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170523083301.htm). In addition, **this need for connection encourages us to spend time with people who are similar to us**—the feeling of sameness enhances our sense of belonging. However, being around like-minded people makes it difficult to think differently—because surrounding ourselves with people who believe the same things we’ve been _conditioned_ to believe reinforces our thinking patterns.)

#### Your Happiness Depends on Making _Others_ Happy

Wiest claims that your early experiences conditioned you to believe that you could only ever be comfortable and happy as long as you acted in a way that conformed to what other people wanted and expected from you—in other words, _you_ could only be happy if you made _other people_ happy.

And, to successfully act out your part, you learned to think and interpret the world in the same way that the people you relied on for your comfort and happiness did. The following example illustrates how you were conditioned to adopt other people’s thoughts and interpretations:

- You noticed that your teacher gave you a gold star and a smile when you got perfect grades, and a red cross coupled with a stern look when you performed poorly. Your teacher’s responses to you taught you how to interpret your grades: Perfect grades and gold stars are “good” because they make your teacher happy. And when she’s happy, she smiles at you. Because you felt happier when your teacher smiled at you, you subconsciously associated getting perfect grades with feeling happy. On the other hand, because your teacher’s stern looks made you aware of how unhappy she was, you felt uncomfortable and associated making mistakes with feeling unhappy.

> **Your Conditioning Is a Result of What You Believe to Be True**
> 
> The author of _[Psycho-Cybernetics](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/psycho-cybernetics)_, Maxwell Maltz, validates Wiest’s argument that you’ve been conditioned to adopt the thoughts and beliefs of those around you. He argues that, as a child, _you unconsciously adopted the opinions and beliefs of others as **truths**_, regardless of whether or not these opinions were based on facts.
> 
> Why did your mind accept what you heard, saw, and experienced as truth? Because your nervous system can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality—it can only respond to what you think or imagine to be true. When you were young, you were less able to question what was going on around you and form your own rational conclusions. As a result, [you simply absorbed everything you experienced, and your mind accepted these experiences as truths](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/psycho-cybernetics/chapter-2#what-influences-your-self-image).
> 
> Further, Maltz suggests that the conditioning process isn’t as simple as Wiest makes it out to be. He argues that you didn’t automatically adopt the thoughts that helped you to conform to other people’s expectations. Rather, **[the way that you identified with your experiences determined the way you thought about and interpreted similar experiences](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/psycho-cybernetics/chapter-2#what-is-your-self-image)**.
> 
> For example, if your teacher gave you a gold star and a smile in front of all of your peers, you could have identified with this experience in multiple ways: If you were a confident child, you could have felt proud of yourself and your achievement (happy). If you lacked confidence, you could have felt embarrassed about being the center of attention (unhappy). If you wanted to impress a peer who took pride in being a delinquent, you could have felt disappointment about looking like a geek (unhappy). Though your teacher was obviously happy with you, **only the way you identified with the experience defined how happy _you_ felt about it**.
> 
> **As an adult, you can decide what you choose to believe** but, according to Maltz, the “truths” you accepted as a child continue to live in your mind and inform your thoughts and feelings. He suggests that you take control of these outdated truths and replace them with what you _choose to believe_ by regularly visualizing yourself acting in ways that align with your authentic self (who you are beneath the conditioning). Maltz claims that, with constant practice, your mind will gradually become accustomed to accepting your new thoughts and beliefs as _truth_ and will let go of the old, conditioned beliefs.

#### You Rely on External Validation to Feel Happy

In addition to influencing how you think about the world, social conditioning also influences the way you think and feel about yourself. According to Wiest, your feelings of comfort and happiness are so inextricably linked to how other people react to you that **you feel compelled to think about yourself according to how you _imagine_ other people perceive you**. She explains it as follows:

1. You subconsciously assume that your happiness depends on how other people react to you: When you get positive feedback, you evaluate yourself positively and this makes you happy. When you get negative feedback, you evaluate yourself negatively and this makes you unhappy.
2. You only evaluate yourself positively when you believe that others think you _deserve_ positive feedback and reward you accordingly. For example, if your teacher gives you a red cross, you don’t evaluate yourself positively and don’t feel happy, because your teacher thought you didn’t deserve a gold star. On the other hand, receiving a gold star makes you feel happy because it proves that your teacher is pleased with you.
3. Because you want to be happy, you manipulate the way you project yourself to invite more positive feedback. This involves making yourself appear more pleasing or impressive—for example, by suppressing supposedly unappealing parts of your personality or chasing status goals to appear more accomplished.

> **How Seeking External Validation Impacts Your Self-Esteem**
> 
> While it’s clear that seeking external validation impacts your self-esteem, research on self-identity indicates that [the feedback you receive from others is just one of four interrelated components that inform the way you think about yourself](https://positivepsychology.com/self-image-examples-activities/):
> 
> - **Self-image**: how you see yourself
>     
> - **Ideal self**: how you would like to be seen by others
>     
> - **Real self**: the feedback you receive from others that shows you who you really are.
>     
> - **Looking-glass self**: _how you perceive the way others perceive you_ and compare it to the way you see yourself.
>     
> 
> Further, the research shows that you’re more likely to have a healthy sense of self-esteem (how much you like and accept yourself) if your beliefs in each of the four components align with and complement each other.
> 
> In other words, the more your beliefs in each component clash with each other, the more likely you are to suffer from low self-esteem. For example, you see yourself as boring (your self-image) but you want others to see you as interesting (your ideal self). This gap between your self-image and your ideal self creates internal conflict and undermines your self-esteem.
> 
> It’s difficult to pinpoint the beliefs that inform your opinion of yourself in each of these areas. However, there are a number of tests you can take to discover what you really think about yourself—and to what extent external validation influences this opinion—such as [The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale](https://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Self-Esteem_ROSENBERG_SELF-ESTEEM.pdf) or [The Flourishing Scale](https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/The_Flourishing_Scale.pdf).

##### You’re Always Focused on Your Inadequacies

Wiest argues that **this preoccupation with others’ perception of you makes it impossible for you to ever feel comfortable and happy with yourself**—because it compels you to second-guess everything you do and to negatively judge yourself whenever you get unwanted feedback.

She argues that attempting to please or impress others never makes you feel truly happy for two reasons: First, different people want different things, so it’s impossible for you to please everyone. Second, you can never really know what people think about you—the best you can do is make a guess and hope that you’ll manage to elicit the feedback you crave.

Inevitably then, you often fail to receive the feedback you want. And, each time you fail, you assume that it’s because you’re _inadequate_ in some way—if _other people_ don’t feel you deserve their positive feedback, then _you_ won’t believe you deserve it.

You then strive to resolve this by attempting to fix what’s “wrong” with you—hoping that this fix will invite positive feedback. The following example demonstrates how this plays out:

- Your lover won’t commit to you. You assume that he doesn’t think you’re worth committing to, and not worthy of love. You try to figure out _why_ he doesn’t think you’re worthy of love: Because you’re too needy? Or maybe it’s because you’re too fat? In the next relationship, you’ll try to make your partner believe that you’re worthy of love by acting more aloof and going on a strict diet. You think this will make him want to commit to you—and prove (to you) that you are worthy of love and that you do deserve to be happy.

> **How Seeking External Validation Affects Self-Judgment and Behavior**
> 
> Research in the area of authenticity confirms Wiest’s claim that many people base their self-judgment and happiness on how they think others perceive them. And psychologists agree that acting _inauthentically_—projecting an image that conforms to what you _think_ others want from you—makes you feel inadequate and unhappy.
> 
> Further, the research concludes that [feelings of discomfort and inauthentic behavior go hand-in-hand](https://www.bustle.com/p/15-little-signs-you-arent-being-fully-authentic-every-day-73784). Consequently, you can figure out if you base your happiness on others’ opinions of you by considering how often you feel:
> 
> - Embarrassed by things you’ve done or said
>     
> - Awkward and self-conscious in daily interactions
>     
> - Resentful and misunderstood
>     
> - Afraid of what others think of you
>     
> - Rejected and unheard
>     
> 
> **These feelings both reflect _and_ encourage inauthentic behavior and feelings of unhappiness.** For example, sometimes shy people come across as loud and overbearing. This is because their discomfort around others leads them to _overact_ to compensate for their shyness. As a result, they find themselves projecting a (false) gregarious persona to mask their shyness. This leads them to question whether people like them for who they are or for the act they put on. As a result, they feel _more_ uncomfortable about interacting with others and this compels them to continue projecting an altered image of themselves.

### Part #3: Chasing Validation Makes You Unhappy

We’ve just explained how the mental associations you unconsciously formed as a child compel you to engage in two unhealthy thought patterns:

1. Interpreting others’ responses to you as an indication of how happy you deserve to be
2. Continually looking for ways to fix yourself so that you can elicit positive feedback—and thus feel more deserving of happiness

According to Wiest, relying on positive feedback to feel happy creates a breeding ground for unwanted experiences and negative feelings. This is because seeking validation compels you to engage in two habits that disconnect you from your true needs and make you feel powerless to change your emotions: suppressing your feelings and pursuing the wrong goals.

Let’s explore how these two habits contribute to unwanted experiences and feelings of powerlessness in more detail.

#### Negative Habit #1: You Suppress Your Feelings

According to Wiest, your conditioning inadvertently taught you to believe that some feelings are unacceptable or bad. As a result, you feel ashamed each time these feelings come up, pretend that you don’t feel them, and try to avoid people and situations that might trigger them. You also judge other people who express these feelings as “bad” or “wrong.”

However, these suppressed feelings continue to live on inside you, get stronger the more you try to deny them, and morph into irrational thought patterns and emotional reactions that stifle your capacity to feel positive emotions.

##### Example: Suppressed Feelings Lead to Irrational Thoughts and Emotions

You used to get punished for having tantrums as a child. Your tantrums were your way of expressing disagreement with something that you were expected to do. Therefore, you unconsciously associated expressing disagreement with punishment and labeled disagreement as “bad” or “wrong” in your mind.

Though unconscious, this mental association now shapes the way you think about and react to various situations and contributes to many of your unwanted feelings. This is because it leads to a number of unhealthy behaviors and thought patterns, such as:

**You pretend to agree with others:** Because you want to get along with others and receive positive feedback, you avoid disagreeing with them—either by pretending to take their side or staying quiet. However, the more you avoid expressing your true opinions, the more insecure you feel in your relationships—you never know if people like you for who you are or because you’re validating their opinions.

**You agree to things that you don’t want to do:** Even though this approach garners positive feedback, doing things you don’t want to do often makes you feel angry and resentful. However, because you’re unable to acknowledge how your own thought patterns created these unwanted situations, you mistakenly assume that other people are _making_ you do things that you don’t want to do. This leads you to conclude that other people are to blame for your negative feelings. As a result, you don’t feel accountable for your role in these unwanted situations and you believe that you’re powerless to change them.

**You judge people who _do_ express their disagreement:** Because you believe that expressing disagreement is “bad” or “wrong,” you automatically dislike or feel uncomfortable around people who _do_ express their disagreement. Instead of questioning why you feel this way, you assume that your opinion is valid and that _they should_ change the way they act to make you feel better.

> **Suppressing Your Feelings Creates Emotional Discomfort**
> 
> Suppressing your feelings can have consequences beyond making you agree to things you’d rather not do or judging those who _do_ express such feelings. Tony Robbins, (_[Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within)_) offers additional insights into how suppressing your emotions exacerbates emotional discomfort and feelings of unhappiness. He claims that [suppressing your emotions disempowers you](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-8#reject-disempowering-ways-of-addressing-your-emotions) because it leads you to engage in two irrational behaviors:
> 
> **1) You avoid situations that risk triggering your suppressed emotions:** The problem with this is that you miss out on experiencing the _positive_ emotions these situations might elicit.
> 
> For example, you’ve suppressed your need for affection, so you avoid relationships or pretend not to need affection in a relationship. As a result, you miss out on positive experiences that spring from meaningful relationships, such as love and intimacy. This makes you feel lonely and increases your unfulfilled desire for affection—and your shame for wanting it.
> 
> **2) You disassociate from your emotions by pretending not to feel them:** The problem with this is that these emotions become increasingly intense and eventually lead to irrational outbursts.
> 
> For example, even though you pretend not to need affection, you feel hurt every time your partner fails to give it to you. These negative feelings escalate until you’re ready to explode from frustration. However, instead of honestly expressing your hurt to release this frustration, you avoid addressing your suppressed need for affection and find a different reason to start a fight. As a result, you create conflict in your relationship and fail to resolve the real cause of your distress. This makes you feel misunderstood and increases your desire for affection—and your fear that you won’t get it.
> 
> According to Robbins, the reason you’re suppressing your emotions is that you find them unpleasant. But avoiding or dissociating from your emotions exacerbates the discomfort you feel. He suggests that you can [process your suppressed feelings](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-8#process-your-emotions-in-a-healthy-way) and relieve your discomfort by identifying your emotions, acknowledging and accepting them (instead of labeling them as bad or wrong), and considering what you can learn from them.

#### Negative Habit #2: You Pursue the Wrong Goals

Wiest argues that your reliance on positive feedback compels you to focus more on how you’re perceived by others and less on how you really feel. She explains that your preoccupation with appealing to others makes you unhappy due to the following reasons:

1. **It motivates many of your decisions and goals**—meaning that you spend most of your energy doing things to please or impress others. For example, you wanted to be a nurse but your parents wanted you to become a neurosurgeon because it sounded more impressive to them. So, you dedicated years of extra training to become a neurosurgeon instead of pursuing your desired path.
2. **It prevents you from thinking about what your unique needs are and what you need to feel satisfied and happy**—meaning that you spend a lot of energy doing things that don’t satisfy you or make you happy. For example, being a neurosurgeon leaves you joyless and unfulfilled, but you won’t quit because you fear losing the admiration you’ve worked so hard to attain.

(Shortform note: One way to judge if your goals align with your needs is to consider your motivations. Some experts believe that [all behavior is driven by the need to fulfill one of two motivation types: intrinsic or extrinsic](https://www.healthline.com/health/intrinsic-motivation#how-it-works). Intrinsic motivation comes from within: You accept your needs and feel comfortable expressing them by engaging in activities that make _you_ happy. For example, you choose a career you enjoy and aren’t worried about how others judge you. Extrinsic motivation comes from your environment: You ignore your needs in favor of seeking acceptance from others by engaging in activities that encourage external rewards. For example, you choose a career you don’t enjoy because it garners admiration and positive feedback.)

##### Achieving Wrong Goals Makes You Feel Unfulfilled

Why would you make decisions and choose goals that waste your energy and make you unhappy? According to Wiest, it’s because you believe that happiness comes from having a life that appears perfect to others—and you make decisions and set goals to achieve your vision of this ideal life.

However, Wiest argues, your vision of an ideal life is simply a response to the way that you’ve been conditioned to please others. Unfortunately, **conforming to what others want rarely satisfies your true emotional needs**. Instead, it leaves you unhappy and unfulfilled and puts you in a never-ending cycle of “improving” and changing yourself to please those around you.

Further, because this conditioning is so deeply ingrained in you, you fail to question why your achievements aren’t making you happy. Instead, you assume that you just haven’t done enough to deserve happiness and that you need to be, do, or acquire something _more_—for example, by making yourself more attractive, acquiring more possessions, or achieving a higher status.

> **The Desire for Positive External Feedback Motivates Status Goals**
> 
> The _[Tao Te Ching](https://shortform.com/app/book/tao-te-ching)_, one of the ancient foundational texts of Taoism, clarifies how seeking positive feedback influences your goals and leads to a never-ending cycle of dissatisfaction. It explains that a desire to receive positive feedback influences you to choose status-based goals, such as wealth and power, so that you can _appear_ successful and _prove_ your worth to others. However, status-based goals—such as more money or higher status—have no upper limit and are therefore impossible to “achieve” and drive you to always seek _more_. This pursuit for more prevents you from feeling happy with what you already have.
> 
> [Your desire to fulfill this never-ending goal and receive the feedback you crave consumes you](https://shortform.com/app/book/tao-te-ching/section-2) and surpasses your desire to feel happy _now_. As a result, instead of tending to your emotional needs, you direct all your energy toward pursuing increasingly ambitious goals. Your assumption that achieving your goals will lead to positive feedback and happiness compels you to engage in behaviors that leave you feeling dissatisfied—such as ignoring your emotional and physical health, engaging in competitive or controlling behaviors, or acting inauthentically.

#### Consequence: You Feel Powerless to Change Your Emotions

Wiest argues that suppressing your feelings and pursuing the wrong goals makes you believe that you’re powerless to change the way you feel about your experiences. As we’ve already explored, you’ve been conditioned to put your thoughts and emotions at the mercy of things outside of your control. When other people don’t give you the feedback you depend on to feel happy, or your experiences fail to live up to your ideal vision of happiness, you feel disappointed and unhappy.

Because you’ve given these external factors so much power over your happiness, you mistakenly assume that they are responsible _for_ your happiness. And, since you've ceded so much responsibility for your happiness to forces you believe to be outside your control, you feel you are powerless and without agency to take responsibility for how you think and feel.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that ceding responsibility for your happiness makes you feel powerless because it contributes to a [victim mentality](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-victim-mentality-5120615)—the belief that bad things happen to you through no fault of your own. A victim mentality creates feelings of apathy because feeling like external factors are thwarting you diminishes your motivation to take accountability for your feelings. Instead, people with a victim mentality often magnify their problems and their _perceived injustices_ in an attempt to gain attention (comfort, sympathy, reinforcement of their beliefs) from others. The attention they receive from others _validates their powerlessness_ and keeps them from changing the way they think about and respond to their experiences.)

### Part #4: Think for Yourself

We’ve just discussed how social conditioning influences you to think and behave in ways that leave you feeling unhappy and powerless to change your feelings. In this final part of the guide, we’ll explore ways to become more conscious of your thoughts so that you can take better control of them and improve the way you feel.

Wiest argues that, though your conditioning is pervasive, you can overcome it, learn to think for yourself, and feel better about yourself and your experiences. She suggests four methods to help you achieve this.

#### Method #1: Take Responsibility for Your Thoughts and Emotions

According to Wiest, before you can effectively take control of your thoughts and emotions, you first need to acknowledge that you’re the only one responsible for them. Recognizing this fact encourages you to:

- Understand how your thoughts influence the way you interpret and feel about your experiences.
- Realize when you’re giving control of your thoughts and feelings to things outside of you—for example, when you credit or blame other people or situations for your emotions.
- Explore ways to think differently about the people and things that make you feel bad—because you know that’s the only way to improve the way you feel about them.
- Make conscious decisions that align with your needs and encourage you to feel good about yourself. For example, refusing to attend social events that you have no interest in gives you more time to pursue things that you’re genuinely interested in.

> **Change Your Self-Image Before Attempting to Change Your Thoughts**
> 
> Wiest seems to imply that you can change your thoughts and emotions simply by deciding to take responsibility for them. However, this isn’t as easy as it sounds: While you may attempt to change your thoughts when you’re aware of them, the majority of your thoughts take place beneath your awareness—in your subconscious mind.
> 
> In _[Psycho-Cybernetics](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/psycho-cybernetics)_, Maxwell Maltz explains that your subconscious mind learns from your habitual thoughts and feelings to create your self-image. It then influences you to think and behave in ways that reflect this self-image and actively _discourages_ you from thinking or behaving in ways that are inconsistent with it. Maltz goes so far as to say that your subconscious mind sabotages your conscious attempts to change your habitual thoughts.
> 
> For example, if you habitually think that people are out to get you, you’ve trained your subconscious mind to include perpetual distrust as a part of your self-image. As a result, your subconscious mind influences you to _automatically_ think and act in ways that keep you focused on all the ways people could harm you. It might influence you to think paranoid thoughts or encourage you to act defensively. Additionally, it may sabotage any attempt you make to trust others—for example, influencing you to interpret innocent remarks as insults.
> 
> Unlike Wiest, Maltz argues that you can’t rely on your thoughts to change your feelings unless you consciously change your self-image and retrain your subconscious mind. He suggests that you can achieve this by regularly visualizing yourself behaving in ways that align with what you want and who you want to be.

#### Method #2: Focus on Your Feelings to Define Your Needs

According to Wiest, thinking for yourself requires getting to know yourself. This involves paying constant attention to how you feel so that you can discover who you are and what you need to feel happy. Wiest explains that the more aware you are of your feelings, the easier you find it to challenge and replace the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to your unwanted feelings.

How can you develop an awareness of how your thoughts create your feelings? Wiest suggests that being mindful will help you to shift your focus from the external (other people, your circumstances) to the internal (your feelings). This, in turn, will help you **separate how you feel about yourself from how you imagine other people think about you**. As a result, you’ll be able to think more clearly about what’s important to you and what you need to feel happy.

(Shortform note: Mental health practitioners confirm that [practicing mindfulness increases self-awareness](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858), encourages positive thoughts about yourself, your circumstances, and others, and improves your mental well-being. In _[Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindfulness-in-plain-english)_, Bhante Gunaratana recommends establishing a schedule to turn your mindfulness practice into a habit. Begin by setting aside 10 to 20 minutes each morning or evening to practice quieting your mind, lengthening your time as you get more comfortable with the process.)

#### Method #3: Assess Your Current Opinions and Beliefs

According to Wiest, an important step in learning to think for yourself is assessing whether your current opinions and beliefs align with who you really are, or if they only exist to please or impress others. She suggests that you can dissect each of your opinions and beliefs by asking yourself the following four questions:

1. **When was the first time you came across this idea?** For example, you believe that people should not make mistakes. You remember overhearing your parents punishing one of your siblings for making errors on a spelling test.
2. **How does this idea influence your judgment of yourself, other people, and your experiences?** Your belief that people should not make mistakes compels you to be overly critical of yourself and others. It also makes you feel resentful of the experiences that don’t live up to your perfect standards.
3. **How might adopting opposing ideas impact you?** If instead, you choose to believe that it’s okay to make mistakes, you might find it easier to accept and forgive yourself and others for making mistakes. You might also be less inclined to notice mistakes in the first place.
4. **How would you choose to think about this if your thoughts were already aligned with who you really are?** Your aligned self sees mistakes as a valuable part of learning. Therefore, there’s no need to feel critical of yourself or others for making mistakes.

> **Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Challenge Your Opinions and Beliefs**
> 
> Like Wiest, [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.guelphtherapist.ca/blog/cognitive-therapy-challenging-negative-thoughts/) (CBT) practitioners argue that the more you question the validity of your thoughts and beliefs, the less likely you are to accept other people’s opinions as your own. However, the CBT method provides more specific questions to help you objectively examine your opinions and beliefs from multiple perspectives. Therefore, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of your beliefs if you answer the following questions in addition to Wiest’s four questions.
> 
> **Facts**
> 
> - What evidence is there to support your thoughts about this?
>     
> - What evidence disproves or contradicts your thoughts about this?
>     
> - Are your opinions getting in the way of the facts?
>     
> - Are there any facts that you’ve ignored or overlooked?
>     
> 
> **Other explanations**
> 
> - Can you think about this differently?
>     
> - Is your mood impacting the way you’re thinking about this?
>     
> - Have you ever felt differently about this?
>     
> - Are you likely to change your opinion about this over time?
>     
> 
> **Your feelings**
> 
> - How does believing in this idea make you feel good?
>     
> - How does believing in this idea make you feel bad?
>     
> - How will you feel if you continue to hold onto this belief?
>     

##### Explore Your Judgments to Identify Your Suppressed Feelings

In addition to exploring your opinions and beliefs, Wiest suggests that you should specifically explore your judgments about other people to identify your suppressed feelings. According to her, **every negative feeling you have about someone _else_ is simply a projection of the aspects of _yourself_ that you dislike or feel ashamed of**. Therefore, she suggests that you consider all of the things that you dislike about other people to uncover what parts of yourself you’ve been conditioned to believe are “wrong” or “bad.”

This exercise will reveal how you’re currently modifying your behaviors to please or impress others. It will also help you to accept and express the parts of yourself that you’ve been too ashamed to expose to others.

- For example, you despise your colleague at work because she constantly interrupts you while you’re busy. Exploring deeper, you realize that you dislike her because you view her interruptions as a ploy for attention. Seeking attention is something you avoid doing because you’ve been conditioned to see this as “wrong.”

> **Use Affirmations to Process Your Suppressed Feelings**
> 
> Like Wiest, many self-help practitioners claim that your negative judgments about others reflect what you dislike about yourself. However, Louise Hay (_[You Can Heal Your Life](https://www.hayhouse.com/you-can-heal-your-life-paperback?utm_source=LH.com&utm_medium=Shop&utm_campaign=LH.com_YCHYL)_) takes this idea one step further. She claims that **you subconsciously _transmit_ your suppressed thoughts and feelings and _influence_ other people to reflect these feelings back to you**. Hay bases this on her interpretation of the [law of attraction](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-and-using-the-law-of-attraction-3144808)—the idea that the universe orchestrates your reality to mirror your subconscious thoughts and beliefs.
> 
> For example, even though you crave affection, you act aloof—because your conditioning taught you that acting needy is “bad.” However, while you might project a cool image of yourself, you’re subconsciously emitting emotional signals that reveal your true feelings—your desire for affection and your shame for feeling this desire. These emotional signals then _attract_ experiences that trigger the emotions you’re trying to avoid—because people intuitively pick up on your feelings of neediness and feel compelled to reflect them back to you.
> 
> According to Hay, practicing self-acceptance and self-love affirmations helps you process and express your suppressed feelings. For example, to process your suppressed feelings regarding your need for affection, affirm, “I love and accept my need for affection” multiple times a day.
> 
> Once you’re able to accept and express your feelings, you’ll no longer judge them as negative. Further, Hay claims that accepting your feelings will change the emotional signals that you send out—meaning that other people will no longer feel influenced to display the behaviors you previously disliked.

#### Method #4: Explore Your Daydreams to Reveal What You’re Seeking From Others

According to Wiest, your wishful hopes and daydreams reveal exactly what type of feedback you’re subconsciously seeking from others to feel good about yourself. This is because they’re simply a projection of the things that you feel you most lack and are relying on others to fulfill. Recall: You feel like you’re missing something because you’re not fulfilling your own needs.

Therefore, Wiest suggests that you figure out exactly what feedback you’re craving from others by exploring how other people react to you in your daydreams. Once you’ve noted what types of reactions you’re craving from others, find a way to fulfill these needs for yourself.

- For example, you often fantasize about meeting a “perfect” person who falls instantly in love with you and tells you that you’re the most beautiful person in the world. This suggests that you’re waiting for other people to tell you how much they love you and how beautiful you are so that you can feel those things about yourself. However, if you find a way to love yourself—whether it’s through affirmations, visualizations, mindfulness, EFT, or something else—and appreciate your beauty, you’ll no longer feel the need to seek this feedback from others.

> **Your Daydreams Point to Life Areas That Dissatisfy You**
> 
> According to psychologists, your daydreams don’t only point to what feedback you’re craving, but also to what you need to feel satisfied with your life. [You rely on daydreams to provide a therapeutic mental escape from reality](https://www.psychologies.co.uk/what-your-daydreams-reveal-about-you/): You’re more likely to get lost in them and rely on the comfort they provide when you feel dissatisfied with the real world and can’t see a way to fulfill your needs. For example, when you feel lonely, you’ll daydream about being surrounded by friends. Or, when you feel bored, you’ll daydream about doing something stimulating.
> 
> Therefore, as you work through Wiest’s method, pay attention to _when_ you rely on daydreams—this will reveal the dissatisfying life areas that you’re trying to escape from. Then focus on ways to increase your satisfaction in these areas. For example, if you often daydream because you feel bored at work, increase your satisfaction by taking on interesting or challenging work projects that provide more mental stimulation.
