## 1-Page Summary

**Popular entrepreneur Ryan Holiday and translator Stephen Hanselman wrote _The Daily Stoic_ as a daily devotional to share insights from the ancient Stoic philosophers on how to live a good life**. It was a bestseller in 2016 and was widely featured in media outlets such as _The Wall Street Journal_ and _The New York Times_. It’s also been expanded into a [podcast and website](https://dailystoic.com/) that serves as a treasure trove of Stoic wisdom for daily living.

Stoicism was founded in the third century BCE in Greece, but it came to be associated with the Romans. Some of its most noteworthy early practitioners include the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the Roman slave Epictetus. In time, the philosophy was practiced by numerous leading historical figures, including George Washington and Immanuel Kant, and it has a long list of modern admirers and practitioners.

The popularity of Stoic philosophy, according to Holiday and Hanselman, is due to its practicality: From early on it was meant to be a way of life, not just a set of abstract ideas. **At the core of Stoicism is the belief that the cardinal virtues—self-control, courage, justice, and wisdom—are the source of internal stability and peace of mind and the measure of a good life**.

We’ve organized our guide according to the three broad categories of Stoic practices Holiday and Hanselman include in _The Daily Stoic_, including viewing life with _self-control_, responding to life with _justice_ and _courage_, and managing our lives with _wisdom_. Within each category, we’ll look at some essential principles that support these Stoic practices.

Our commentary explores other perspectives on these principles and offers more insights from Stoic philosophy and modern psychology.

> **Criticisms of Holiday’s Popular Approach to Stoicism**
> 
> Ryan Holiday has done a lot to popularize Stoicism [in his books on the subject](https://ryanholiday.net/books-courses/), but [his portrayal of the philosophy—and the surge of attention it’s brought to the subject—has been criticized](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxvmw/the-revival-of-stoicism). Critics of Holiday’s approach to Stoicism have two main concerns: It reduces Stoicism to life hacks and misrepresents it by ignoring the broader Stoic worldview.
> 
> _The Daily Stoic_ isn’t exempt from these criticisms. First, some critics argue that as a self-help book that mines ancient Stoic aphorisms for improving your daily life, it reduces Stoicism to little more than a system of self-interested life hacks. While ancient Stoics [viewed their philosophy as a way of life](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/), experts argue that [it was never a philosophy of self-interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/opinion/stoics-self-help.html), as Holiday seems to present it. Instead, the ethical teachings of Stoicism promoted both _individual_ well-being and the well-being of _society_. It wasn’t just about making your life better.
> 
> Second, some readers criticize Holiday for only exploring Stoic ethics and ignoring Stoic teachings about what’s real (ontology and metaphysics) and what’s true (logic, including epistemology and language theory). Holiday isn't alone in ignoring these parts of the philosophy—most modern popularizers of Stoicism exclude them because they don't easily fit with modern science. Defenders of this approach argue that [Stoic ethics don't depend on the broader Stoic worldview so much that they can't stand on their own merits](https://modernstoicism.com/do-stoic-ethics-depend-on-the-stoic-worldview-by-chris-gill/). There’s so much value in the ethical practices of Stoicism, they contend, that [it’s worth simplifying the philosophy to bring them to a modern audience](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/fashion/ryan-holiday-stoicism-american-apparel.html).

### Stoic Practices

In _The Daily Stoic_, Holiday reflects on quotes from Stoic thinkers, such as Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, and suggests ways their insights might be practiced today. However, Holiday warns that no Stoic claimed to perfectly embody every Stoic tenet—instead, they _strove for that ideal_.

(Shortform note: The authors emphasize practicing the Stoic insights in your daily life but only mention in passing that, in the Stoic view, a perfect life is an _aspiration_—not necessarily a reality. Considering how significant this is, readers should know at the outset of this section that these Stoic practices are hard. Marcus Aurelius understood that living a good life was an ongoing challenge, and he spent considerable time [reflecting on how he might do better each day](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/6367/meditations-by-marcus-aurelius/). Therefore, remember that _The Daily Stoic_ is a collection of Stoic _goals_, not a scorecard of Stoic _achievements_.)

In this section, we’ll look at some of the practices the Stoics had for living well. First, we’ll consider their way of _viewing_ life, which concerns our ability to make sense of life with reason. Next, we’ll consider Stoic ways of _responding_ to life, which deal with our actions and behavior. Finally, we’ll discuss _managing_ our lives like the Stoics by undertaking wise practices that keep us focused on the job of living virtuously.

#### Viewing Life With _Self-Control_

According to the Stoics, living a virtuous life starts with _self-control_. The authors explain that Stoics equate self-control with being the captain of your ship, not the passenger. Stoics argue that to practice self-control, you must actively make sense of life with _reason._ Through reason, you can control your _view of life_: the foundation of your understanding, your intentions, and even your actions.

The Stoics assert that when you don’t actively use reason, you end up a _passive_ participant in life controlled by circumstances, emotions, and unchecked desires and thoughts. When this happens, you’ll lack self-control and will be unable to live virtuously.

In this section, we’ll consider four central aspects of how you can live virtuously by practicing self-control through reason.

> **The Role of Reason in Stoicism**
> 
> The authors associate the virtue of self-control with the way we perceive the world—we’ve described this as viewing life with self-control. The glue in this association is reason. While the authors aren’t clear about how this association works, some basic principles of Stoic thought make it more apparent.
> 
> The Stoics believed that [the world presents itself to us through our senses](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH3a). We form our understanding of what we experience through our senses by using our reason—if we judge our impressions to be true, we “assent” to them. Otherwise, we withhold our assent. This is a form of exercising self-control.
> 
> To the Stoics [this capacity to assent—to reason—makes us human](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/): It’s our nature. Philosophers explain that Stoicism’s goal (telos) is [to live according to nature](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/). For a tree, that nature may include staying put and making fruit, but for a human that nature is using reason to live virtuously. You do this by 1) perceiving the world with logic/reason, then 2) acting with the four virtues of wisdom, self-control (temperance), courage (fortitude), and justice. Reason is the means or tool to attain each of the virtues. Those who act with perfect reason enjoy complete well-being and are [unaffected by circumstances and bad emotions](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/what-is-the-goal-of-stoicism).

##### Recognize What You Can and Can’t Control

To the authors, living this way depends first on recognizing a central Stoic principle we’ll call the _basic division of control_: **You can’t control anything except the way you think.** This belief lies at the core of Stoicism's philosophy of viewing life and underpins all the practices described in the sections below.

You _can’t_ control external circumstances such as the actions of another person, the state of the economy, or whether you get sick or injured, but you _can_ control how you view or understand those things with your _mind_. In this way, the Stoics argue that _reason_ is your main tool for controlling your view of life.

(Shortform note: Some philosophers argue that this account of the Stoic view of _control_ [is derived from a faulty translation and can lead to a misunderstanding](https://modernstoicism.com/what-many-people-misunderstand-about-the-stoic-dichotomy-of-control-by-michael-tremblay/). In their view, a proper translation implies that internal states (such as our character and beliefs) _depend on us_ for their existence, but external states (such as circumstances and outcomes) _don’t_ depend on us. The implication is that the Stoics didn’t necessarily believe you could _control_ your internal state at any particular moment. If you’re sleep-deprived or drunk, for example, your internal state still _depends_ on you—even if you can’t control it at the moment! The same is true of your thoughts: They _depend_ on you, but, as neuroscience suggests, [you can’t always control them](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-we-control-our-thoughts/).)

The authors consider common experiences through this lens: Imagine you read of global turmoil in your news feed. Economic forecasters are predicting a recession unlike any before. You should recognize that much of this situation is beyond your control. You can’t affect the conflicts around the world and you can’t stop a recession from coming. You can’t even control what news stories reach you or how they frame the issues they report.

However, you _can_ control the way you understand the situation. You can view it circumspectly—recognizing that bad news sells, that your ability to live a virtuous life doesn't depend on the amount of money in your bank account, and that your thoughts alone are under your control. Understanding this, you can be unmoved by the news of the day.

(Shortform note: Psychologist Albert Ellis ([an admirer of Stoic philosophy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200703/albert-ellis-confident-and-kicking)) formulated a model of this Stoic approach to changing your thought patterns called [the ABC model](https://worldofwork.io/2019/07/the-abc-framework-for-overcoming-stressful-situations/): Activating event (trigger) + Beliefs (self-talk) = Consequences (our response). He suggests that we change our _self-talk_ when we encounter events that cause us stress. As we practice this, we’ll become adept at avoiding the negative (stressful) response. Ellis’s model of the approach complements the Stoic’s ideas by providing a very simple way to think through negative feelings and unproductive behaviors: You can’t change the _activating event_, but you can change the _beliefs_ that lead to those negative _consequences_.)

##### Notice Yourself

For the Stoics, a second aspect of viewing life with self–control entails _noticing yourself_. The authors explain that you need to observe your tendencies—your thoughtless habits, faulty senses, and irrational impulses, for instance—and account for the way they affect your view of life. **By checking every thought, impression, and action with conscious reasoning, the Stoics believed you’ll be better able to maintain self-control**.

For example, many of us tend to uncritically trust our senses. We believe what we see. However, we should be aware that our senses aren’t always trustworthy: Magicians and optical illusions famously exploit this weakness. The Stoics noticed that our senses can’t always be trusted, so they suggested that we check our confidence with humility: We might be wrong.

The authors state that we may also be inclined to act on irrational impulses—the Stoics advise us to be aware of these impulses and resist them with self-control, guided by reason. Maybe we feel like we can’t resist the urge to eat all the french fries or hit the snooze button once more. Notice that these kinds of impulses are _irrational_, caused by sensory stimuli and thoughtless habits. The Stoics argued that we should only act based on our _reason_: Can you justify eating all those fries or staying in bed past your alarm? If not, don’t do it.

(Shortform note: Modern experts have a view similar to the Stoics on this issue. In _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow)_, behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman argues that automatic (fast) impressions arise from our senses and feelings (he calls this the mind’s “System 1”). Like the Stoics, he acknowledges that these impressions are prone to errors, but he believes it’s not feasible to _always_ check them through our rational mind (“System 2”) because it’s too slow. He suggests a compromise: Be aware of situations where System 1 thinking might lead to errors, and avoid those errors when the stakes are high by using System 2. This approach offers a practical way to incorporate the Stoic ideal of noticing yourself.)

##### Be Mindful of Your Emotions

According to the authors, a third aspect of viewing life with self-control entails _being mindful of your emotions_: For the Stoics, clear thinking _leads to_ well-regulated emotions and is _affected by_ unregulated emotions. They understood that emotions are an inescapable part of life, but they argued that they can become an obstacle on the path to virtuous living. The authors describe the two ways this can happen:

**First, wrong thinking can lead to emotional suffering.** The Stoics believed anxiety comes from desiring something outside of your control. If you bear the _basic division of control_ in mind, you can avoid anxiety.

(Shortform note: Psychologists agree on this point, asserting that anxiety comes from [mistakenly believing we can control things we can’t](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dont-try-harder-try-different/201104/control-is-illusion-part-1). To become aware of this, they suggest you try to affect the outcome of events by deliberately worrying. If you try this, you’ll soon recognize that worry has _no effect_ on anything but your mental well-being. They caution, however, that [there are some circumstances we can control](https://www.spring.org.uk/2021/07/illusion-of-control.php)—our choice to eat well, for instance. Psychologists agree with the Stoics that we need to take responsibility for the things we can influence and resist the urge to worry about the things we can’t.)

**Second, emotions can cloud your thinking.** Anger, for instance, can affect your attention and your judgment, causing you to fixate on the object of your anger and assume bad intentions where there are none. To the authors, Stoics view anger as an unproductive emotion that never leads to the best outcome. Such emotions undermine your clarity of mind.

(Shortform note: The Stoics saw anger as an unproductive emotion, but they didn’t view all emotions this way, [as many people assume](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-stoicism/2021/06/01/53609cea-bcca-11eb-9c90-731aff7d9a0d_story.html). They believed that [the skilled Stoic is free from bad feelings but enjoys good feelings](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44985501). Bad feelings are _irrational_—caused by impressions about things we _mistake_ to be good or bad (such as sex or loss) that are actually _indifferent_. These feelings (broadly categorized as desire, fear, pleasure, and sorrow) cause us to misunderstand life. Good feelings, by contrast, follow from a correct view of life: From this vantage point, we experience joy, volition (intent to do what’s right), and caution (in response to legitimate evil, such as cowardice). These are the emotions Stoics aspired to experience.)

##### See Your Assumptions

The authors say that one final aspect of viewing your life with self-control involves _seeing your assumptions_. Assumptions are a way our brains bypass reason, and they aren’t necessarily accurate. As such, **the Stoics believe that controlling our view of life with reason involves being aware of—and questioning—our assumptions**.

(Shortform note: Scientists offer a model way of dealing with assumptions [that illustrates how Stoics might approach them](https://mind.ilstu.edu/curriculum/scientific_method/scientific_method.html). When designing an experiment, researchers make certain assumptions known as a _hypothesis_ (for instance, this disease will be affected by this vaccine). The goal of the experiment is to determine whether this hypothesis is accurate. Researchers will also carefully identify all other implicit or explicit assumptions in the experiment (for example, this syringe won’t degrade the quality of the vaccine). Every assumption must be justified in order to know the experiment’s results are reliable. This is the kind of approach the Stoics advise: See and question your assumptions if you hope to understand things accurately.)

Some of us, for example, are pessimists. By assuming the worst of every situation, we affect the overall tenor of our thoughts. This negative bent can easily cause us to misinterpret life. For example, we may assume that our boss wants to fire us because she seems angry this week. For the Stoics, this assumption isn’t reasonable—we’d be better off adopting a neutral perspective that allows us to be impartial. More often than not our boss’s bad mood has more to do with circumstances in her own life than with us.

Similarly, some of us unquestioningly take on the assumptions of those around us, write the authors. We might so strongly identify with a certain group of people—a labor union for instance—that we adopt the group’s assumptions as our own without determining whether they’re true or false. Our views, in this way, become predetermined by the group we identify with. Again, for the Stoics, this isn’t consistent with being the captain of your own ship: **You can’t uncritically adopt the assumptions of others _and_ control your own view of life.**

(Shortform note: Modern psychologists echo this advice from the Stoics. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy describes the tendency to make assumptions [as a kind of cognitive distortion called “fortune-telling.”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sustainable-life-satisfaction/201909/are-you-guilty-making-too-many-assumptions) Clinicians note that this cognitive distortion can lead to depression and a lack of confidence, among other things. To overcome fortune-telling, they suggest you _examine the evidence_, _believe in your ability to think it through_, and _adopt deliberate strategies to distract yourself from overthinking._ These three strategies will help you develop the ability to think your way through situations as the Stoics advise, rather than making assumptions and jumping to conclusions.)

#### Responding to Life With _Justice_ and _Courage_

By controlling her view of life, the Stoic can discern right from wrong and act accordingly. In any situation, she can use her mind to cut through the noise of distracting emotions and impressions that could make her think or act in ways that aren’t virtuous. When someone tries to provoke her anger or fear, for instance, she recognizes the temptation to vice and chooses to think and act virtuously instead—with equanimity. This right action requires a sense of justice to know what’s right and the exercise of courage to follow through on it. In this section, we’ll consider four ways we can put justice and courage into action.

(Shortform note: The authors associate justice and courage with our actions, but they don’t claim the association is exclusive—_all_ the virtues (justice, courage, self-control, and wisdom) can manifest in action. [Self-control, for instance, is characterized by good discipline, and wisdom by discretion](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/), both of which manifest in our actions. In fact, the Stoics believed you couldn’t truly possess one of the virtues without the other. In this sense, _all_ four virtues influence every aspect of ourselves: our will, thoughts, and actions.)

##### Aim to Do Good

The authors write that to live justly and courageously, you should first _aim to_ _do good_. To do good, the authors recommend you start by studying Stoic philosophy, and then follow up that study by taking action. **The study of Stoic philosophy will enhance your sense of justice. Following through on that sense of justice will require courage.**

(Shortform note: The authors encourage you to study Stoic philosophy, but they don’t claim to give a comprehensive guide to it in _The Daily Stoic_. For that, you might turn to introductory books, such as Brad Inwood’s _[Stoicism: A Very Short Introduction](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/stoicism-a-very-short-introduction-9780198786665?cc=us&lang=en&)_, which explain how the entire worldview fits together. Consider reading such a guide if you’d like to take your study of Stoicism further.)

The authors argue that doing all of this demands effort. It’s easy to avoid this effort through procrastination, cowardice, or laziness, so the Stoics advise us to be on the lookout for these vices and cultivate a strength of character that enables us to overcome them.

For example, many of us put off doing the right thing until tomorrow because we don’t want to do something difficult, and we think that it’ll feel easier tomorrow than it feels today. The Stoics disagree—_now_ is the time to do what’s right, whether it’s hard or not.

Similarly, many of us get sidetracked in our efforts to live virtuously. We want to be entertained, look attractive, or avoid suffering. None of these distractions is inherently bad, as the Stoics saw it, but each can sidetrack us from courageously pursuing justice.

(Shortform note: Once again, the way to avoid vice and distractions, say the Stoics, is by exercising reason. This is evident from their beliefs about children: They held that [children are more prone to vice and distraction than adults because their reasoning is undeveloped](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26414180). They argued that a child’s tendency to act on impulses—much like an animal’s—is a natural survival mechanism: Nature inclines them to jump in fear and eat whenever they’re hungry so they avoid harm and meet their bodily needs. As humans mature, reason serves to control these impulses. Once we can discern right from wrong and truth from error, we can avoid vice and distraction and do good.)

##### Respond Well When Things Go Wrong

According to the authors, life will test our courage and our commitment to justice—it gives a steady stream of opportunities to _respond well when things go wrong_. **The Stoics argued that, even in the face of disappointment, fear, and other difficulties, we need to steadily pursue virtue**.

(Shortform note: Disappointment is a painful, but normal, emotional response when things go wrong. Experts suggest that the way you respond to disappointment can be transformational—[it gives you the chance to grow stronger in your pursuit of your goals](https://www.betterup.com/blog/disappointment). Some good ways to overcome disappointment include journaling or talking about it, reassessing your core values, and accepting yourself for who you are. Consider some of these strategies as you look to apply Stoic practices.)

Along these lines, they encourage us to take our setbacks in stride. If we find ourselves suddenly out of work, for instance, we need to process our situation through our _reason_ and keep our focus on living virtuously. Don’t lash out in anger or check out of your daily responsibilities—that accomplishes nothing good. Instead, consider how you can learn from your situation. With this mindset, the Stoics argue, we can even treat setbacks as an opportunity to grow in virtue.

(Shortform note: Psychologists argue that the single most important way to take setbacks in stride is to [regulate your emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201311/the-one-most-important-way-cope-when-things-go-wrong). The first step to do this is _identifying_ the particular emotion you’re feeling—for example, anger. Once you’ve done that, pay attention to your physical response: Are your cheeks flushed? Is your head pounding? If so, begin breathing deeply and steadily and tell yourself to relax. You should be able to tone down the emotional response. When you’re calmer, you can begin dealing with the situation with clarity of mind as the Stoics suggest.)

The authors claim further that the Stoics reinforced their commitment to living virtuously by simply _expecting_ things to go wrong. If you expect that you’ll lose things you enjoy, for instance, you’ll be less afraid of it happening, and less affected when it does happen. Knowing that trials _will_ come, they reasoned, prepares you to face them well when they arrive.

(Shortform note: Expecting things to go wrong can easily [devolve into an unproductive mindset known as catastrophizing](https://psychcentral.com/blog/imperfect/2016/05/why-am-i-always-expecting-the-worst#What-causes-catastrophizing?). In this frame of mind, you become fixated on the worst possible outcomes of situations—everything is a catastrophe. Mental health professionals note that this pattern of thinking is especially common for those who are prone to anxiety or overthinking. They suggest several strategies for overcoming catastrophic thinking, including noticing your thought patterns, challenging your negative assumptions, and rationally considering other possibilities. If you’re prone to negative thinking, bear this in mind as you consider the Stoics’ advice to _expect_ things to go wrong.)

##### Follow Through

A third way we can respond to life with courage and justice is by _following through_ on our commitment to living virtuously. **As the Stoics saw it, the job of living a virtuous life is long-term, so we need to figure out how we can stick to it.**

The authors offer an insight from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius into dealing with flagging motivation: **Remind yourself that others depend on you to do what’s right**. For him, this wasn’t about his special role as emperor, it was about his _essential_ role as a human being. In his view, all humans depend on each other to do what’s right. If we don’t do our part—whether big or small—others suffer in a world a little more deprived of virtue.

(Shortform note: Marcus Aurelius motivated himself by appealing to his sense of belonging: Feeling connected to something larger than himself gave him purpose. In his case, this sense of belonging came from his deeply held philosophical beliefs. Others may find purpose in their religious beliefs. In either case, psychologists agree that commitment to overarching values—rather than a commitment to just yourself, your family, or your community—[makes you more resilient to stress and hardship](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mindfulness-practice_b_4683073).)

Another way the authors recommend you increase your follow-through is to be _patient_ and _take it slow_. By rushing into things—taking on responsibility too quickly, for instance—we run the risk of burning out. It’s far better to keep a slow and steady pace that you can maintain.

This holds for the abstract notion of pursuing virtue, but it’s also true of our concrete obligations such as our work or our role as citizens or partners. For the Stoics, the way we treat our small, day-to-day tasks comes to characterize our entire lives. Therefore, it’s important for all of us to do the best we can at a pace we can sustain for the long haul.

(Shortform note: Experts argue that feeling tempted to give up on your obligations is a sign that [your approach to those obligations should change](https://hbr.org/2016/11/beating-burnout). If you begin to feel cynical for instance, it’s a sign that you’ve lost sight of your purpose. Likewise, feeling exhausted indicates that you need more sleep, exercise, or nutrition. Paying attention to these signs is a practical way to implement the Stoic’s advice to follow through on your goal of living well.)

##### Be Realistic

A final way to respond to life with justice and courage is to _be realistic_. The authors argue that **Stoic philosophy is practical at its core—it’s meant to be lived in the _real_ world rather than just discussed in the abstract**. Therefore, the Stoics believed that living virtuously was possible in the face of all the imperfections of real life.

(Shortform note: The authors draw on the work of Pierre Hadot, who argued that [ancient philosophies—such as Stoicism—were meant to be a way of life](https://iep.utm.edu/hadot/). The modern practice of philosophy, by contrast, tends to be seen as the detached work of aloof academics. Hadot believes that this change began during the early centuries of the Christian era, when secular philosophy was replaced by sacred theology. In time, he says, science replaced both theology and philosophy as a way of life. Philosopher Jules Evans argues that Stoicism has become so popular lately [because it fits our modern way of thinking well](https://www.stoicinsights.com/philosopher-jules-evans-on-why-stoicism-has-become-so-popular-over-the-last-decade/): Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for instance, is largely derived from Stoic principles that can be supported by science.)

For instance, the Stoics recognized that no matter how hard you work at building your character, you’ll still have weaknesses. They believed you can turn these weaknesses into strengths. Maybe you’re prone to laziness, for example. Thinking like a Stoic, you might find that your inclination to do the least amount of work has value: You can use it to increase the efficiency of a task by weeding out wasteful steps in the process. This kind of thinking works _with_ your weakness and maximizes its potential, allowing you to find strength by realistically appraising your characteristics.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest a different approach to dealing with weaknesses. They argue that it’s unusual to turn a weakness into a strength, but [it’s possible to minimize the effect those weaknesses have on you](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/functioning-flourishing/201502/can-you-turn-your-weaknesses-strength). The way to do this is to focus on maximizing all of your strengths and minimizing all your weaknesses by, for instance, delegating responsibilities or compensating with your strengths.)

Similarly, the Stoics knew that our time is limited. Accordingly, they believed you shouldn’t spend more time on any task than it deserves. It’s more important to spend time with your family, for example, than it is to obsess over which garbage bags to buy. Save your time and energy for the things that matter.

(Shortform note: Contrary to this idea, researchers have found that [valuing the mundane things in life is associated with a greater sense of meaning in life overall](https://neurosciencenews.com/meaning-life-small-things-21063/). This suggests that looking for the value in tasks you may otherwise consider _unimportant_ is an effective way to feel happier.)

#### Managing Our Lives With _Wisdom_

To view life with self-control and respond to life with justice and courage, the Stoics tried to _manage_ their lives _wisely_. **Wisdom entails applying good judgment to the way you live life so that you can stay focused on living virtuously**. In this final section, we’ll consider four points of advice the Stoics offer for living wisely.

(Shortform note: Like Aristotle before them, [the Stoics distinguished between two kinds of wisdom](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wisdom/): theoretical wisdom (_sophos_ or knowledge about reality) and practical wisdom (_phronesis_ or knowing how to live well). _Phronesis_ is sometimes equated with _virtue_ as a whole: In this sense, all the virtues are the exercise of _wisdom_. This presents a difficulty because the Roman Stoics also had another term for wisdom: _prudentia_ or “prudence.” Though Holiday and Hanselman only use the term _wisdom_, some modern Stoic thinkers believe _prudence_ gets at the meaning better—[to live prudently is to discipline yourself with reason](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/09/20/sophia-vs-phronesis-two-conceptions-of-wisdom/). Bear this meaning in mind as you consider how you might follow the authors’ advice to manage your life with wisdom.)

##### Be Humble and Kind

According to the authors, the first piece of Stoic advice is to _be humble and kind_. **By practicing humility and kindness, the Stoics believed you could spare yourself—and those around you—a lot of needless suffering and distraction.**

To see the practical value of humility, consider those who aren’t humble—those who have an inflated opinion of themselves or who are convinced they _deserve_ all the good things in life. People with this attitude are at risk of a more catastrophic fall when things _do_ go wrong or when they misstep. Those who are humble, by contrast, don’t have far to fall, so they’re less prone to being devastated when things go wrong.

(Shortform note: Not all pride leads to this kind of fall. Psychologists distinguish between [good pride (authentic) and bad pride (hubristic)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070615214643.htm). Authentic pride is vital for healthy self-esteem and leads to better relationships and positive behavior. Hubristic pride, on the other hand, is the kind described above—it’s associated with narcissism and selfish behavior.)

Similarly, the Stoics believed it’s wise to be kind to those who are suffering hardship _now_ because you may one day be in the same position. By showing kindness to others in need, you may receive kindness in return when you need it.

(Shortform note: Research shows that there are more benefits to practicing humility and kindness than merely reducing suffering and distraction. For instance, in two recent studies, people who showed traits associated with humility (low self-focus and high other-focus) [were less likely to be depressed, more likely to have a healthy love life, and more likely to believe they could achieve their goals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00332941211062819). Similarly, studies on kindness have shown that [it can increase well-being and even lower blood pressure](https://www.apa.org/news/apa/kindness-mental-health). Results like this suggest that practicing humility and kindness is as wise as the Stoics argue.)

##### Practice Virtue Now

The Stoics offered another insight for living wisely: _Practice living virtuously now_, in each present moment. **They believed that a whole life is merely the sum of its parts and argued that a virtuous life is lived in the day-to-day interactions and opportunities we each face**.

(Shortform note: Evidence from neuroscience backs up this insight. Researchers find that the human brain physically changes in response to experience by reinforcing neural pathways activated in that experience ([this attribute is called experience-dependent neuroplasticity](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-boosting-experience-dependent-neuroplasticity-adult-brains.html)). Through repeated experiences, such as daily interactions, our brains develop behavior patterns that can either be positive or negative. This suggests that by practicing good behaviors in our various daily interactions we make it easier for our brains to respond that way. Conversely, practicing bad behaviors makes it harder for us to act differently.)

Toward that end, they taught that you should put your future legacy out of your mind—don’t concern yourself with how (or if) you’ll be remembered. Instead, the authors say, simply focus on the task in front of you, whatever it is: Do it to the best of your ability.

(Shortform note: By contrast, some psychologists warn that [you may regret not thinking about your legacy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201404/what-will-your-legacy-be). It’s common for the elderly to regret the way they spent their lives—the choices they made and the relationships they neglected, for instance. Accordingly, psychologists suggest that it can be healthy to think about how you want to feel in the future and how you want to contribute to humanity. By considering these kinds of things you can make better choices now and avoid future regret.)

Similarly, choose to practice virtue in your daily interactions. Be a good listener, encourage others, never seek revenge, and always tell the truth. The authors say these daily interpersonal practices build virtuous character and comprise the bulk of your life.

(Shortform note: Some business leaders approach this idea from a different angle—to them, [your daily interactions constitute an important part of your reputation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2014/01/28/10-simple-ways-to-improve-your-reputation/?sh=215853206b9f). They argue that, since a good reputation is invaluable to a successful business and career, you should go out of your way to build that reputation. Help others look good. Be consistent. Even though this approach treats good behavior as a means to an end, the Stoics would recognize the practical benefits of having a good reputation.)

##### Receive Life as It Is

A third principle for living wisely, according to the Stoics, is learning to _receive_ _life as it is_. As they saw it, _circumstances_ are neutral—neither good nor bad. By contrast, _actions_ can be good or bad. Knowing this, **our life circumstances are little more than a canvas on which we paint our virtuous actions**.

(Shortform note: While circumstances had no moral value to the Stoics—they described them as _indifferent_—they maintained that [circumstances aren’t equally neutral](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/). For instance, they considered wealth a _preferred_ indifferent, poverty a _dispreferred_ indifferent, and the shape of your ear an _absolute_ indifferent. Generally, a person is better off wealthy and healthy than poor and sick, though, occasionally, the Stoics believed that enduring such suffering was helpful for cultivating virtuous character.)

Keeping this in mind, you shouldn’t wish for circumstances to be anything other than what they actually are, write the authors. Don’t hope for a better future or pine for a remembered past—live virtuously in the present moment exactly as it is.

(Shortform note: People often recommend [living in the moment if you want to feel happy](https://www.happierhuman.com/live-moment/), but that’s not the goal the Stoics had in mind. For them, living in the moment was _reasonable_—there’s no use in concerning yourself with the past because you can’t affect it at all. Similarly, you can only affect the future by what you do in the present. Therefore, you should focus on doing good in the present. You might feel happier as a result, but that’s just a byproduct of living rationally, according to the Stoics.)

Moreover, to the Stoics, receiving life as it is entails _detachment_ from experiences and possessions. They argue that our experiences in life and the things we accumulate can become traps that co-opt our focus and desires, write the authors. Maybe we own a nice house or we’re skilled at a sport—those things aren’t within our control. It’s not reasonable to hold onto them tightly because they’re not guaranteed to last: The house could burn down in a fire, or the skill could dwindle with age or injury. Virtue, on the other hand, endures.

(Shortform note: This insight is not unique to the Stoics. Outside of Stoicism, detachment (also called non-attachment) is an important concept in numerous religious traditions. In Buddhism, for instance, [non-attachment is the means to achieve enlightenment](https://www.learnreligions.com/why-do-buddhists-avoid-attachment-449714). Jainism holds a similar view, asserting that [possessions are an impediment to achieving liberation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/aparigraha.shtml). Similarly, to keep their focus on Christ, [Christians are discouraged from becoming attached to things of the world](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203&version=NIV).)

##### Think About Death

Finally, Stoic thinkers argued that it’s wise to _think about death_. For them, keeping death in mind was a way to focus on living better: **Life is finite, so we’d better use it well**.

(Shortform note: Some studies suggest that [thinking about death does help us live better](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120419102516.htm), but others indicate that it can cause us to become more prejudiced and greedy. Terror Management Theory (TMT) argues that people who fear death compensate by [acting out of self-preservation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/terror-management-theory). So while thinking about death may be wise advice, it should be balanced by an awareness that _fearing_ death could lead to negative behaviors.)

They reasoned that _time_ is one of our most valuable possessions. We have a limited allotment of it that can’t be renewed, and each moment brings us closer to death. Therefore, they suggested that we treat time with the value it deserves—don’t give it away without getting something of value in return. The authors suggest, for example, that you say _no_ to most requests on your time. Social gatherings and meetings rarely provide enough benefit for the time you spend on them, as they see it.

(Shortform note: In _[Essentialism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/1-page-summary)_, Greg McKeown reiterates this view, arguing that [we should focus on doing only a few things well](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/essentialism). To him, like the Stoics, most things that command our time and attention are unimportant. A key way to avoid being overwhelmed by these unimportant things is to say _no_. McKeown offers a practical tip for making this easier: [Accept that you might be unpopular for a little while when you say no](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/essentialism#learn-to-say-no). This is just a temporary setback, however, because people usually come to respect you more when they see how you value your time.)

To the Stoics, your time should be used to build your character and live virtuously in the world. If you manage to live for a long time, they argued, you should have something to show for all that spent time. You should have wisdom, strength of character, and a track record of virtuous actions. The authors thus advise that you focus on cultivating those attributes _now_ so that you’re ready when death comes.

(Shortform note: This begs the question: What did the Stoics believe happened _after_ death? The answer to this draws on their broader system of thought. The Stoics believed that _pneuma_—the breath of life—[pervaded all matter, thought, and souls in various degrees of “tension.”](https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/pneuma/v-1) Some Stoics believed that the souls of wise humans would continue, separate from the body, while the souls of unwise humans would be destroyed or reabsorbed into the cosmic _pneuma_. So, for these Stoics, preparing for death was a matter of what would become of the soul. Modern Stoics who don’t share these views may simply be motivated to live well in the present so they can avoid regrets at the end of life.)

Death, according to the Stoics, levels the playing field. The wealthy and the poor, the high-status and the low-status, the strong and the weak—we all share the same fate, explain the authors. Keeping this in mind, the Stoics believed, would help you overlook superficial differences between people and recognize that **life gives us all one shared opportunity: to live virtuously**.

(Shortform note: The Stoics, like modern psychologists, recognized that [it’s common for humans to compare themselves to one another](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-social-comparison-process-2795872). Experts find that we do this [consciously and unconsciously](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116308447), sizing up how our skills and possessions rank in the social hierarchy. Studies show that the way we evaluate ourselves in the social hierarchy [may have an impact on our health and well-being](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953621006043). By minimizing our perceived differences, we can improve our sense of status and stave off the negative consequences of comparison.)
