## Principle #4: Connection

In the previous two chapters, you learned about defusion and expansion: how to use your observing self to accept negative thoughts, images, feelings, and urges.

In this chapter, you’ll learn about the fourth principle of ACT: connection. Harris writes that **connection is the technique of using your observing self to connect to the external world through your five senses.** The first four principles of ACT, taken together, constitute a group of skills we can call _mindfulness_.

In this chapter, we’ll begin by exploring connection. Then, we’ll walk through some exercises that will help you practice connection. Finally, we’ll discuss the first four principles of ACT as a whole, and how they connect to ACT more broadly.

### The Thinking Self, Revisited

As we’ve already covered, the thinking self produces a running commentary on our lives, both internal (through your emotions) and external (through your five senses). Harris asserts that we go through most of our lives not questioning our thinking self. **Often, despite what’s going on around us, we’re focused on the world of the thinking self: our memories, our plans, our judgments.**

The thinking self focuses on the past and the future. This is a consequence of the way our thinking self evolved: Harris notes that it was important for our primitive ancestors to be able to think about the future in order to make plans for survival. Similarly, our ancestors needed to be able to incorporate lessons from the past into their daily lives. When their minds did consider the present, they focused mainly on threat detection and avoidance. (Shortform note: It’s not mentioned explicitly here, but the primitive accumulate-and-improve mentality Harris described earlier also relies on an understanding of the future—and the ability to plan for it.)

By contrast, in the modern world, the thinking self’s running commentary poses a constant distraction. For instance, we’ve all caught ourselves zoning out in the middle of a conversation—thinking about our grocery list, our plans for the evening, or a past conversation.

Harris argues that the more attention we pay to the thinking self, the less we notice the world around us. Sometimes, that’s OK; for example, it’s appropriate to be absorbed in your thoughts when performing creative or scientific work. But **more often than not, the distraction posed by our thinking self is an obstacle to a deeper connection with the world.**

> **Mind-Wandering Is Natural, But Not Always Helpful**
> 
> Psychologists at Harvard have found that [our brains are hardwired](https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/KILLINGSWORTH%20&%20GILBERT%20(2010).pdf) to be distracted by our own thoughts. A study they conducted found that we spend 47% of our time in a state called “mind-wandering,” where we reflect on the past, plan for the future, or simply fantasize about being somewhere else. This, as Harris observes, is our brain’s natural function.

> This is an important function because it allows us to learn, among other things. But it’s also the source of much of our unhappiness. For example, while 42.5% of people in the study reported that their minds wandered to pleasant topics, their mind-wandering did not make them any happier than if they’d been present and engaged in what they were doing.

### Exploring Connection

Harris writes that **connection is the practice of using our observing self to shift our attention away from the past and future in order to be fully engaged in the present moment**. Connection sometimes occurs involuntarily, when we find ourselves in circumstances where the immediate experience of the present is overwhelmingly pleasant or stimulating. For instance, some people experience this kind of immersion on a great first date: They remember the view from the restaurant, the clothes that the other person wore, the food they ordered, and the taste of the wine. This feeling of complete immersion in the present moment is what Harris means by connection—however, involuntary connection can often be short-lived. This is why we must deliberately practice connection.

Harris lists three main reasons to practice connection:

1. We get to live only one life, and it’s relatively short. If the choice is between living in the moment and living outside of it, most of us would choose the first.
2. In order to shape the kind of life we want to live, we must act—and the only time we have to take action is in the present.
3. **Only awareness of the present moment allows us to take effective action**, action that aligns with your values.

(Shortform note: In addition to the benefits that Harris lists, research shows that [connection—or mindfulness—strengthens relationships](https://www.healthline.com/health/being-present#benefits), makes stress more manageable, and improves symptoms of anxiety and depression.)

Achieving connection requires the techniques discussed in the previous principles, because, when our thinking self obsesses over negative thoughts and feelings, we tend to disconnect from the present. Therefore, **in order to achieve connection consistently, we need to practice _defusion_ from our negative thoughts and _expansion_ to accept our unwanted feelings.**

> **Presence as the Means vs. the End**
> 
> Eckhart Tolle’s _[The Power of Now](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now)_ focuses on the idea of connecting to the present moment as the solution to the problems of the ego (what Harris would call the thinking self) and the pain-body (the sum total of negative emotions that you carry). In contrast to Harris’s view that connection is one tool among many, Tolle argues that being connected with the present moment can serve as a sole solution for the problem of suffering.
> 
> Still, there are some commonalities between Tolle’s and Harris’s approaches:
> 
> - Both agree that the thinking self (or ego) is a huge problem for most people.
>     
> - They agree that the thinking self is predominantly concerned with the past and the future instead of the present moment.
>     
> - They agree that harnessing our observing self (what Tolle calls “the inner body”) connects us to the present moment.
>     
> 
> But, whereas Tolle views being present as the goal of a spiritual journey, Harris argues that connection is merely a technique that we can apply in order to allow us to connect with our values and take committed action (consistently and fearlessly acting in alignment with our values). According to Harris, if we don’t do these later steps, then it doesn’t matter whether or not we live in the present moment.

### Three Connection Exercises

Now that you have a sense of what connection is, here are some exercises that you can practice in order to develop it as a skill. (Shortform note: These techniques are all related to the concept of body awareness. Although Harris doesn’t explicitly link connection and body awareness, the organization of the six principles suggests that the technique discussed in each principle builds on the previous ones.)

#### Exercise #1: Five Things

The first exercise Harris suggests aims to help you **connect with your environment.** He recommends doing it a few times each day.

1. Take a moment out of your day. Any moment will do, but Harris suggests that taking a walk may be a good context in which to practice this exercise.
2. Look around your environment and pick out five objects you see. You’re training your observing self to pay closer attention to the world around you, bringing you more fully into the present moment.
3. Concentrate on your environment and pick out five sounds.
4. Concentrate on your body and pick out five things touching you.

> **Use Your Senses to Battle Anxiety**
> 
> This exercise is a variant of [the well-known 5-4-3-2-1 exercise](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-4-3-2-1-countdown-to-make-anxiety-blast-off) for dealing with anxiety. This exercise focuses your attention away from anxious, recurrent thoughts (which come from the thinking self, as Harris would describe it) and into the present moment.
> 
> To practice the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise, notice:
> 
> - Five things you can see
>     
> - Four things you can feel
>     
> - Three things you can hear
>     
> - Two things you can smell
>     
> - One thing you can taste
>     
> 
> Tapping into each of the five senses grounds you in your physical experience in the present moment.

#### Exercise #2: Doing Chores

In this exercise, **Harris recommends using an unpleasant task as an opportunity to practice connection.**

1. Choose a household task that you don’t like doing but that has to get done—for instance, putting away the dishes, sweeping the floor, or cleaning the toilet.
2. Practice connection as you do this chore. For example, if you’re putting away the dishes, notice the feel of the ceramic against your fingertips. Hear the sound of dishes clanking as you put them away. Observe the shape of the utensils as you stow them in the drawer.

Harris suggests exercising connection with an unpleasant task two or three times a day. As you practice, it will become easier to achieve connection.

> **Single-Tasking**
> 
> This exercise is an example of [single-tasking](https://www.healthline.com/health/mind-body/mindfulness-activities#for-adults) (the opposite of multitasking), which entails being singularly focused on whatever task you're doing.
> 
> As you become more skilled at single-tasking, you can increase your connection to the present moment even further by:
> 
> - Focusing on your breathing
>     
> - Noticing how your feet feel against the floor, or your body feels in your chair
>     
> - Noticing the sensation of your clothes against your skin
>     
> - Paying attention to your posture
>     

#### Exercise #3: Breathing for Connection

Just as deep breathing releases tension in Step 2 of expansion (as discussed in Principle #3), **Harris’s third exercise uses deep breathing to lower the tension in your body to enable you to practice connection.**

The exercise is simple: Breathe deeply 10 times.

- For the first five breaths, concentrate on your breathing—the movement of your stomach, diaphragm, and chest.
- After your first five breaths, allow your observing self to surface. Continue to focus on your breathing, but also pay attention to the input you receive from your five senses.

Since deep breathing is a key aspect of accepting difficult emotions in expansion, this exercise is particularly effective when you’re overwhelmed by your thoughts and feelings. Taking 10 deep breaths can relieve tension and allow you to practice defusion, expansion, and connection.

Remember that the end goal of ACT is to enable you to take _effective_ and _committed_ action—behaviors that align with your values—to build toward a meaningful life. Occasionally, You may discover that there is no immediate solution to your problem. In that case, take some deep breaths and fully accept the thoughts of your thinking self, the feelings of your physical body, and the situation you’re in.

> **Mindful Breathing**
> 
> This exercise is an adaptation of [mindful breathing](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/mindful_breathing). However, while Harris’s exercise is a tool in the process of accepting difficult emotions and taking committed action, the goal of mindful breathing is simply to focus the mind away from stress and anxiety and toward the basic, physical act of the breathing body.
> 
> To practice mindful breathing, sit or lie down in a comfortable position with your eyes open or closed. (If you’re using mindful breathing to practice connection, keep your eyes open so that you can notice all of your five senses.) As you breathe,
> 
> - Inhale deeply through your nose for three seconds.
>     
> - Hold your breath for two seconds.
>     
> - Exhale from your mouth for four seconds.
>     
> 
> Most practitioners recommend practicing mindful breathing for five minutes at a time—or about 30 breaths.

### Mindfulness: The “Acceptance” in ACT

At this point, we’ve discussed the first four principles of ACT: connecting with the observing self, defusion, expansion, and connection. These four principles form the foundation of the concept of “acceptance” in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Taken as a whole, they constitute a foundation that Harris calls _mindfulness_.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness is not unique to ACT. [It can be found in many ancient Eastern traditions and religions](https://positivepsychology.com/history-of-mindfulness/), such as yoga, Buddhism, and meditation.)

Harris explains that **in the context of ACT, mindfulness is a psychological state of openness and awareness attainable through consistent practice of mindfulness skills** (such as defusion, expansion, and connection). In ACT, mindfulness has four specific traits:

1. Mindfulness is deliberate.
2. Mindfulness requires awareness (the observing self), as opposed to thinking (the thinking self).
3. Mindfulness entails existing in the present.
4. Mindfulness requires complete receptivity to experience.

In short, practicing the skills you’ve learned so far allows you to accept your thinking self’s thoughts and images, your physical feelings and urges, and the situations and circumstances of the external world.

But attaining this state is not an end unto itself—instead, ACT relies on the concept of practical application, or the extent to which any behavior helps you develop a valuable and enriching life. In other words, **mindfulness is a practical skill (or set of skills) meant to enable you to take action to improve your life in the real world.**

> **Buddhism’s Definition of Mindfulness**
> 
> In contrast to ACT’s approach to mindfulness, the Buddhist conception of mindfulness relies on [four foundations](https://www.lionsroar.com/living-with-awareness-an-excerpt-from-the-four-foundations-of-mindfulness-in-plain-english/):
> 
> **1. Mindfulness of body**: The body is, itself, composed of bodies (like organs and cells). We should not identify with the whole body nor its components as “ours,” but rather see them merely as physical forms. This helps us accept that they are transient—they will age and undergo injury, illness, and death.
> 
> Harris only partially addresses mindfulness of the body when he brings up body awareness as a necessary component of expansion. Also, his treatment of body awareness is purely physical and does not have the spiritual element of acknowledging bodily transience.
> 
> **2. Mindfulness of feelings**: Feelings can be classified into pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings. As with the body, none of our feelings are truly our own—they are merely sensations or emotions in the body. Because feelings are impermanent and unsatisfactory, they are not the proper basis for defining the self.
> 
> Like Buddhism, ACT regards feelings as sensations in the body that are unrelated to who we are as people. Feelings come and go, but the observing self remains.
> 
> **3. Mindfulness of mind**: The mind does not exist—only particular _states of mind_ that respond to external or internal circumstances. Like feelings, thoughts come and go, but they do not form the basis of who we are.
> 
> Harris’s views align with this description of the mind. His conception of the thinking self versus the observing self relies on the idea that we are not our thinking selves, and our minds do not reflect reality absolutely.
> 
> **4. Mindfulness of dhammas**: Dhammas are “phenomena” or “teachings.” Buddha teaches that enlightenment can only be found by seeking dhammas from within—not through other people.
> 
> ACT doesn’t encompass this part of Buddhism. Instead of promoting the idea of enlightenment, ACT emphasizes mindfulness as a means to the end of taking committed action.
