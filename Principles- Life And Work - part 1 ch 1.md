## Part 1: Key Themes From Dalio’s Life | Chapter 1: Independent Thinking

To help readers understand how he developed his principles, Dalio shares the story of founding his hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, including his mistakes and realizations. In Part 1 of this guide, we expand on the foundations and key themes of his principles and include relevant references to his biography.

Dalio was born in 1949, the only son of a jazz musician father and a stay-at-home mom. **He demonstrated an independent streak early on**—he didn’t like school because he disliked rote memorization and following instructions. However, he was single-minded when it came to his interests. He started investing in stocks at age 12, got lucky and tripled his money during a bull market, and from then on, he was hooked on the stock market. He read annual reports from public companies and kept buying more stocks.

(Shortform note: There are some similarities between Dalio’s childhood and that of Microsoft founder Bill Gates. [Gates was also bored in school at times](https://www.biography.com/business-figure/bill-gates), but he was highly engaged when it came to his interests. While Dalio studied and invested in the stock market beginning at age 12, Gates was fascinated by computers and spent much of his early life in the computer lab. Dalio’s and Gates’s passionate interests would help shape their lives later on.)

College better suited Dalio’s independent nature as it gave him the freedom to choose his subjects. In 1971, he graduated from C.W. Post with a degree in finance and, with his near-perfect grades, he was able to get into Harvard Business School.

While at Harvard, Dalio took an interest in commodities. After graduating with his MBA, he worked as a commodities trader in a brokerage firm while also trading his own account. He was eventually fired from the firm for being too wild (he shares that he once punched his boss in the face) and founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975. Bridgewater began by advising customers on how to handle market risks and later started buying and selling on his clients’ behalf, earning a percentage of the profits.

(Shortform note: Dalio has a nonconformist side that has gotten him fired, but it has also served him well—research suggests that [rebels can make good leaders](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/how-can-you-tell-someone-has-true-leadership-skills-surprisingly-science-says-they-are-rebels-who-break-rules.html). Lean into a rebel leadership style by going beyond routine and seeking our fresh strategies, encouraging other people to disagree with you, and taking on unexpected roles.)

**Dalio’s independent thinking led him to bet against the consensus view.** The late 1970s were a volatile time, economically speaking, and Dalio was confident that all signs pointed to a looming depression. He told his clients this and adjusted Bridgewater’s investments based on his prediction. At first, it looked like he was completely right. But due to the Fed’s interventions, the market rebounded, and Dalio ended up being completely wrong. He lost nearly everything—he had to let go of his entire staff and even had to borrow money from his dad to stay afloat.

(Shortform note: Like Dalio, [other successful people first experienced failure](https://www.inc.com/sujan-patel/5-failed-entrepreneurs-who-made-a-big-comeback.html), which has led to the myth that successful people need to fail before finding success. While this makes for a good story, research says that these types of comebacks play a role in just a small percentage of success stories, and [most entrepreneurs who fail once will most probably fail again](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-entrepreneurs-dont-learn-from-their-mistakes-11575256081). That’s because they don’t properly identify the real cause of their failure and may blame outside factors instead of their own actions. Dalio’s principles can help you examine the truth of your failure and guide you in building the knowledge and experience you need to find success on your next attempt.)

### Learning From Mistakes

In retrospect, Dalio thinks that failure was one of the best things to happen to him because it revealed four errors that taught him important lessons:

#### Lesson #1: He Was Too Emotional

He realized that emotions led him to overreact in the short term, which led to rash decisions. He thus learned to focus more on facts than on feelings.

(Shortform note: Dalio believes that emotions muddle decision-making, ultimately leading to failure. However, some argue that emotions can be helpful in certain situations. For instance, in _[Never Split the Difference](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/never-split-the-difference)_, Chris Voss argues that negotiation requires displaying empathy toward the other party to make them feel safe enough to let their defenses down.)

#### Lesson #2: He Had Been Overconfident

He was so sure that he was right in his economic predictions, but his failure led to a healthy fear of being wrong. This led to a shift in his perspective: Instead of stating, “I know I’m right,” he started asking, **“How do I know I’m right? What am I missing?”**

Carefully examining his knowledge and decision-making process in this way prompted him to be relentlessly curious about why other smart people disagreed with him. He learned to get a broad range of inputs from other people, carefully considering the credibility of each source before making a decision.

> **Four Other Questions to Ask for Better Decision-Making**
> 
> Dalio’s questions—“How do I know I’m right?” and “What am I missing?”—lead to greater insights and, ultimately, better decisions. Beyond Dalio’s suggestions, there are four other [research-backed questions](https://www.inc.com/jelise-keith/7-research-backed-questions-that-lead-to-great-decisions.html) you can ask when faced with a complex or important decision:
> 
> - **What are the facts?** If you’re making decisions as a team, this question can reveal if you’re all working with the same information and prevent misunderstandings.
>     
> - **What are the steps to make this succeed and to address possible challenges?** It’s important to map out how to make something work, what the risks are, and how to address those risks.
>     
> - **What kind of effect will this decision have a year from now?** Envisioning what success or failure will look like in the long run can give you a clearer idea of the decision’s consequences and help you determine the amount of effort you need to devote to making the decision.
>     
> - **How does this affect others?** Consider the impact—both positive and negative—on the community. Ethical decision-making builds trust, demonstrates respect, and gives you a sense of fulfillment.
>     

#### Lesson #3: His Study of History Was Incomplete

Had Dalio studied other aspects of economic history beyond what had happened in his lifetime, he would have seen that a recession wasn’t a certainty. He vowed to study the movements of major economies and markets over centuries and to assemble a set of principles that were timeless and universal.

(Shortform note: There are [various economic theories that help predict future events](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-effective-is-economic-theory). Mathematical modeling, for example, is very thorough, but it might not consider relevant nonmathematical insights. Thus, some believe that Dalio’s method of [looking at historical data is still the most unbiased, realistic way](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2009/09/23/does-the-past-predict-the-future) to make assumptions about the future.)

#### Lesson #4: He Had Incorrectly Perceived an All-or-Nothing Choice in His Investing

Dalio thought he could either pursue high returns and high risk, _or_ lower risk and lower returns. He learned to look beyond the obvious, conventional choices and found that the best path is often hidden or unconventional.

This lesson revolutionized his approach to investment. Dalio and his team realized that proper diversification could reduce risk without harming returns. The typical idea of diversification at the time was to have a mix of investments within one asset class—for example, buy a hundred different stocks instead of one, or invest in wheat, sugar, and corn instead of just one commodity. However, the investments within the asset class still strongly generally rose and fell together.

Bridgewater found that the **key was to add assets that were _uncorrelated_ with each other**. The result of this true diversification was a return-to-risk ratio that was multiple times better than their previous strategies, meaning they could make more money with lower risk of losing money.

Based on these principles, Bridgewater introduced a new fund called **Pure Alpha**. Even though the strategy wasn’t proven in practice, some clients believed in the concepts and invested. It went on to make money in 23 out of the 26 years since it started and has made more money in total than any other fund ever.

> **Successful Companies Choose _And_ Over _Or_**
> 
> Dalio applies the idea of diversification to investments, but he says you can use it no matter what business you’re in: Make a number of uncorrelated bets to reap the rewards without exposing yourself to too much risk.
> 
> In _[Built to Last](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last)_, Jim Collins writes that [enduringly successful companies employ a similar central concept](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last/chapter-3):
> 
> - **They’re not limited by _or_.** Successful companies don’t believe in scenarios where they _must_ choose between seemingly contradictory choices A or B. For example, low cost _or_ high quality, idealism _or_ pragmatism. In the case of investments, the prevailing approach before Pure Alpha was high profit _or_ low risk.
>     
> - **Instead they employ the power of _and._** Successful companies figure out a way to have both A _and_ B. Collins says a good example is Johnson & Johnson, which was able to pursue both its ideals (alleviating pain and disease, putting customers and employees ahead of shareholders) _and_ profits. In the case of Pure Alpha, investors saw high profits _and_ low risk.

### Systematic Decision-Making

Dalio found success in investment not only because of this independent thinking, but also because of his discovery that he most often succeeded when he **systematized his decision-making process into algorithms** so clear that even computers could run them. In financial trading, he was able to visualize the market as being made up of individual cause-and-effect relationships. For example, the price of a T-shirt would depend on the fashion trends, how much water it takes to grow cotton or other materials, and how rain affects these crops. To Dalio, this looked like a machine that he could model and predict prices of.

(Shortform note: Dalio isn’t alone in thinking that looking at things as a system could be beneficial. In _[Thinking in Systems](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-systems)_, author Donella H. Meadows writes that many aspects of the world operate as systems, and understanding how they work is crucial to solving problems and producing changes. But in contrast with Dalio, she believes [systems are more complex than simple cause-and-effect relationships](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-systems/introduction), consisting of a large set of interconnected elements.)

#### Computers and Automating Decision-Making

As Dalio rebuilt Bridgewater in the early 1980s, he used computers to turn his investment principles—looking at things rationally, analyzing historical data—into automated rules. This had a number of benefits:

- **Computers could produce trading decisions in real time,** enabling him to react faster to new situations, since he didn’t have to ponder from scratch how to react.
- **Computers reinforced logic over emotion**, especially during short-term fluctuations that could lead people to buy or sell in a panic.
- **Computers could collect much more data and crunch the numbers much faster.** The team fed in financial datasets for every country possible, going back by more than a century. Computers could then back-test the investment rules against this historical data, showing how the strategies would have done in the past.

(Shortform note: Real-time reporting, emotionless logic, and faster computing speed make automated trading more logical and efficient, but [there are some disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/automated-trading-systems.asp) as well. These include mechanical or technical failures that could result in errant orders and over-optimization that leads to poor performance in a live market.)

But the computers didn’t work in isolation at Bridgewater—humans and the computers worked alongside each other and improved each other. The humans had imagination and logic that the computers didn’t, and could introduce new rules. The humans could also override the computer in unexpected situations, such as the September 11th terror attacks.

> 
> Automation has clear benefits, but most people don’t have the power of automation behind them for their personal investments. You can [keep from making ill-informed, emotional decisions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-random-walk-down-wall-street/chapter-11) by following some advice from economist and former portfolio manager Burton Malkiel in _[A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-random-walk-down-wall-street)_:
> 
> - **Don’t be influenced by what others are doing.** If everyone’s getting out of the market during a slump, stay in, because the market will eventually rise again. If there’s a boom, resist the urge to buy high, because the market is bound to drop.
>     
> - **Avoid hyperactive trading.** Those who overtrade, or trade for short-term gains, tend to incur higher transaction costs and taxes, thus earning lower returns.
>     
> - **Sell losers, not winners.** While a losing stock can rebound, selling it can give you tax breaks. On the other hand, selling winners can be subjected to higher taxes.
>     
> - **Never buy an IPO at its initial price.** Studies show that IPOs underperform in the stock market and drop in value six months after going public.
