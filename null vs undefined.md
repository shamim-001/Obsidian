#null #undefined #js-concept 

Here are the most important points differentiating `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript:

1. `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It is automatically assigned to variables that are declared but have not been assigned a value or do not exist. On the other hand, `null` is also a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

2. When you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, the default value is `undefined`. For example:
   ```javascript
   let myVariable;
   console.log(myVariable); // Output: undefined
   ```

3. `null` is typically used as an assignment value to explicitly indicate the absence of an object value. It is often used to reset or clear a variable that was previously holding an object reference. For example:
   ```javascript
   let myObject = { name: "John" };
   myObject = null;
   console.log(myObject); // Output: null
   ```

4. `undefined` is also returned when accessing object properties or variables that do not exist or are not assigned a value. For example:
   ```javascript
   const myObject = { name: "John" };
   console.log(myObject.age); // Output: undefined
   ```

5. Comparing `undefined` and `null` using strict equality (`===`) will result in `false` because they are distinct values. However, both `undefined` and `null` are considered falsy values in JavaScript.

6. When you want to check if a variable has been assigned a value or exists, you can use strict equality (`===`) to compare it with `undefined`. For example:
   ```javascript
   let myVariable;
   if (myVariable === undefined) {
     console.log("myVariable is undefined");
   }
   ```

7. It is generally recommended to use `null` when you want to indicate the intentional absence of an object value and use `undefined` for variables that have not been assigned a value or do not exist.
