## 1-Page Summary

In _Quiet_, author Susan Cain contends that **whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert affects every aspect of your life.** Your personality type influences your choice of partner, friends, career, and lifestyle, as well as how those choices play out—for instance, how you advance in your career or handle differences in relationships.

**Researchers say a third to a half of Americans are introverts,** who tend to be quiet, thoughtful, and need time alone. However, Western society is heavily skewed toward extroverts. Our culture, including schools, social institutions, and workplaces, celebrates and is shaped around an “Extrovert Ideal”—a belief that the ideal personality type is someone who is bold, sociable, and seeks the spotlight.

Yet introverts have many underappreciated strengths, including empathy, persistence, concentration, creativity, and the ability to solve complex problems. “Quiet” thinkers are responsible for many important discoveries and artistic achievements, including Einstein’s theories of gravity, Chopin’s _Nocturne_, George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. Besides scientists and artists, high-achieving introverts include Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Al Gore, and Warren Buffett.

Rather than establishing strict definitions of introversion and extroversion, this book explores broad questions, such as whether introverts can be leaders, whether they should ever act like extroverts, and whether introversion/extroversion is biologically or socially determined. Further, it advocates a balance in society, school, and work that lets introverts be true to themselves and where the two personality types complement each other.

### Two Personality Types

There’s no universally accepted definition of introversion/extroversion based on objective criteria, but many psychological researchers agree that:

- **Introverts and extroverts require different levels of external stimulation** to function effectively. Introverts need less outside stimulation—for instance, they prefer to work alone, spend free time alone, or visit with just one or two friends. Extroverts need a lot of stimulation, typically from social activities and busy environments.
- **Introverts and extroverts have different work styles**. Introverts focus on one task at a time, work methodically, and have a great ability to concentrate. They’re not motivated by external rewards. Extroverts jump into jobs quickly, multitask, take risks, and make quick decisions. They may be motivated by factors such as competition and status.
- **They have different styles of interaction**. Introverts can be sociable but soon tire of being in large groups or parties. They listen, think before speaking, and may express themselves better in writing. They dislike conflict and small talk. Extroverts are gregarious, assertive, dominant, and comfortable with conflict. They don’t like to be alone.

**Introverts are stereotyped as recluses or loners who dislike people**. This may be true of some introverts, but most are as friendly as anyone. **Another stereotype is that introverts are shy**. Although some introverts may be shy, there are key differences between introversion and shyness. Shy people dislike social situations because they’re afraid of embarrassment, while introverts dislike social situations because they’re too stimulating.

Introverts also may be “highly sensitive,” which is a psychological term meaning more apt to respond with strong feelings to something—for instance, to be moved by a sad story or be upset by violence.

### The Extrovert Ideal

**We’ve built our society almost entirely around extroversion**. In school systems, for example, this is reflected in the way classrooms are organized and taught: Desks are arranged to facilitate group projects and high levels of interaction and activity. Most teachers believe students should be extroverts.

**In the workplace, we’re expected to engage in relentless self-promotion to develop and promote our personal “brand.”** To advance in many careers, extroversion usually is essential.

Introverts, as both children and adults, are constantly pushed to be more outgoing. Parents and teachers urge children to “come out of their shell” and be more sociable and to participate more in class. Adults are chided for being “in their head” too much, or seen as disengaged at work when they want to think rather than react off the cuff.

But this focus on extroversion has downsides. One downside in the business world is a preference for “Groupthink” that prioritizes teamwork above all. It’s based on the erroneous belief that creativity and intellectual achievement come from collaboration. In reality, an exclusive focus on teamwork actually undercuts creativity, which requires solitude and intense concentration (two things associated with introverts).

Groupthink is responsible for three work phenomena that hinder creativity:

- **Open offices**: Many companies have implemented open-office designs with no walls or private offices and little or no privacy. However, studies have shown that open-office designs create noise, disruption, and stress, which reduce rather than enhance productivity.
- **Multitasking**: Businesses prize multitasking as a way to get more done, but it doesn’t work. Research shows that the brain can’t focus on two things at the same time—it actually switches back and forth between tasks, which lowers productivity and increases mistakes by up to 50%.
- **Brainstorming**: While businesses use team brainstorming to spur creativity, research over the last forty years has underscored that team brainstorming doesn’t generate better ideas.

#### Alternatives to the Extrovert Ideal, at Work and in Schools

The way to encourage creativity and achievement while avoiding the pitfalls of Groupthink is to redesign the collaboration process so it incorporates the strengths of both extroverts and introverts. For example:

- Balance the membership of groups with both introverts and extroverts, and assign tasks in accordance with people’s strengths. Incorporate both introvert and extrovert approaches to problem-solving (reflection and decisiveness).
- Use online brainstorming. In contrast to brainstorming in a group meeting, well-managed online brainstorming groups are effective at generating ideas. The online environment is more conducive to thoughtful give-and-take, at which introverts excel, because it diminishes the grandstanding that occurs in face-to-face groups.
- Create flexible work environments where people can choose to connect in social spaces or to work alone in a quiet space.
- In schools, we should teach children to work with others but also to work independently.

#### Are Extroverts Ideal Leaders?

Another downside of a focus on extroversion is the business world’s unbalanced preference for bold, charismatic leaders. Many extroverted leaders are highly reward-sensitive, meaning that when obsessed with the potential for a big payoff, they may act irrationally and ignore warning signs of problems ahead. The author argues that rash decisions fueled by unbridled extroversion led to the fall of Enron and the 2008 financial crisis.

Multiple studies indicate that extroversion is overrated when it comes to effective leadership. A Brigham Young study of 128 CEOs of major companies found that those viewed as charismatic didn’t perform any better than less-charismatic leaders. Further, some research shows that **introverted leaders perform _better_ than extroverted leaders in certain circumstances,** such as when managing proactive (rather than passive) employees. Researchers concluded that **introverts are effective at leading proactive employees because they tend to listen and are more willing to implement suggestions** as opposed to dominating the situation.

It’s important for companies to have both extroverts and introverts in leadership roles in order to maximize employee output.

### Introversion and Sensitivity

Introversion and sensitivity are highly correlated: one study found that **70% of people categorized as “highly sensitive” are introverts**. Research suggests there are clear benefits to being a sensitive person, such as the ability to think deeply and the tendency to have a strong conscience. The research suggested that having a stronger conscience may promote future altruism, personal responsibility, and better relationships.

One researcher theorizes that the trait of extreme sensitivity may have survived the evolutionary process because of other survival enhancing attributes associated with it, such as astute observation, the tendency to look before leaping, and the tendency to thoroughly process information.

Former Vice President Al Gore, an introvert, is an example of a leader whose sensitivity and conscience benefited society: long before most people cared about it, he engaged in a decades-long campaign to raise awareness of the danger posed by global warming. The welfare of society and even the planet may depend on the capabilities of highly sensitive people, as much as on those of bold doers.

### Stretching Your Temperament

Studies of personality suggest that introversion and extroversion are biologically based. Introversion is associated with traits observable starting in infancy, including high reactivity to stimulation, alertness, sensitivity to nuance, and feeling emotions more intensely.

However, while your innate temperament influences you throughout your life, **you have the ability to stretch your personality beyond your comfort zone and act in ways that don’t come naturally to you**. Psychologist Brian Little argues that it’s worth it to act out of character in order to pursue “core personal projects” or goals that matter deeply to you. For instance, an introvert can be a passionate teacher if sharing his subject with others is a “core project” to him.

Still, acting out of character takes a mental and emotional toll. Introverts manage this by creating “restorative niches” for themselves—mental breaks or physical spaces in which they can recharge. For example, many introverts take a break in the bathroom after giving a speech or during a long social event. You can also create restorative niches by giving yourself a relaxing weekend before a big event, take breaks for yoga or meditation, or replace a face-to-face meeting with a phone call or email.

### Communicating Effectively

Introverts and extroverts are often drawn to each other in the way that opposites seem to attract. The two personality types can balance each other: one talks and the other listens; one is always ready for action, while the other wants to consider all the options. But problems can occur when a couple’s different personality types pull them in opposite directions.

**People often wrongly believe that introverts are anti-social and extroverts are highly sociable.** In fact, the two personality types both have a need for connection but they’re _differently social_.

Here are some key differences:

- **Downtime**: When they get home from work, introverts crave quiet time alone to recover from being around people all day. Extroverts want their partner’s attention and company.
- **Conflict**: Introverts try to avoid conflict, while extroverts are comfortable with a confrontational style of disagreement.
- **Social events**: For introverts, participating in a social event takes a significant mental toll; it’s difficult for them to process information from multiple people simultaneously. However, they enjoy one-on-one conversations. Extroverts are good at handling competing demands on their attention and therefore aren’t as overwhelmed by the flood of information in social situations.

The key to a good relationship is understanding and accepting the different way the other person communicates, resolves differences, and socializes.

### Nurturing Quiet Children

**Introverted children face unique challenges at home and at school, where parents and teachers try to get them to act like their extroverted peers**.

For instance, an extroverted parent may push a quiet child to play team sports or have a lot of friends. Whether they’re extroverted or introverted themselves, parents may fear an introverted child won’t be able to function in society without changing. When a parent wants to change a child, it’s a bad parent-child fit, according to one psychologist. However, **parents can be a good fit for an introverted child by being accepting and learning to see the world from the child’s perspective**. Here are some key steps:

- Help your child adjust to new things. Gradually expose him to new situations and people, while respecting his limits.
- Figure out what subjects and activities energize your child the most and encourage them.
- Teach him how to find a comfortable role in a group and help him practice speaking up.
- Help him practice how to behave in various situations.
- Be nonjudgmental.
- Don’t worry if your introverted child isn’t highly popular.

### Be Yourself

Whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert, be true to yourself. In addition, if you’re an introvert:

- Don’t worry about socializing with everyone—prize the quality of relationships over quantity.
- Use your strengths of persistence, focus, and insight to do work you value and love.
- Figure out what you’re meant to do and make sure you do it, even if you have to stretch.
- Create restorative niches—mental breaks or physical spaces in which you can recharge.
- Respect your own and your loved ones’ needs.
- Spend your free time as you like, not as others expect.

Remember that there are many different kinds of powers. The heroes and heroines of myths and fairy tales discovered and used the power granted to them. Like Alice in Wonderland, introverts are granted keys that can unlock unique worlds and adventures.
