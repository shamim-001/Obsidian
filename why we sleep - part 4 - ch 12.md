# Why We Sleep

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Part 4: The Current State of Sleep | Chapter 12: Sleep Disorders

We’ve talked before about how sleep deprivation causes disease. Now we’ll discuss sleep disorders, or primary issues with abnormal sleep, and their consequences. In this chapter, Walker covers three major disorders: sleepwalking, insomnia, and narcolepsy.

### Somnambulism (Sleepwalking)

Sleepwalking is the act of walking and performing other behaviors while asleep. Automatic, nonconscious routines are executed, like brushing teeth or opening the refrigerator.

Sleepwalking happens during NREM sleep, and not REM dreaming sleep (as some think). Neurologically, sleepwalking is accompanied by an unexpected spike in nervous system activity, causing the person to be stuck somewhere between sleep and wakefulness.

(Shortform note: A 2021 study suggests that [men who sleepwalk may have a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2778518?utm_source=applenews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=article_alert-open_access_feed). The two share a common neural pathway and both involve involuntary movements, confusion, and amnesia.)

Sleepwalking is more common in children than adults, for unknown reasons—possibly because kids spend more time in NREM sleep than adults do.

> **How to Manage Sleepwalking**
> 
> According to the Sleep Foundation, treatments for sleepwalking depend on factors like age, frequency, and severity. If sleepwalking episodes happen a little too often in your household, [try the following](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/parasomnias/sleepwalking):
> 
> - See a doctor to determine any underlying cause.
>     
> - Keep the environment safe by closing and locking doors and windows, clearing the floor of tripping hazards, and keeping potential weapons locked away.
>     
> - Determine the usual time the patient sleepwalks and wake them up before it happens. (If you’re the sleepwalker, have someone wake you up or set an alarm.)
>     
> - Instead of jolting an actively sleepwalking person awake, gently guide them back to their bed.

### Insomnia

Walker defines insomnia as making enough time for sleeping, but having insufficient sleep quantity or quality, for more than three months. Symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, waking up in the middle of night, and feeling unrefreshed in the morning.

He says that when they _do_ sleep, insomniacs have more fragmented REM sleep and shallower brain waves in NREM.

One out of nine people suffer from insomnia. It’s twice as common in women than men, and more common in Black and Hispanic people than white, for unknown reasons.

The most common triggers of insomnia are emotional concerns or distress. The biological cause is linked to an overactive sympathetic nervous system, which raises body temperature and levels of cortisol and epinephrine. In turn, the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala all remain more active than in normal sleeping patients.

(Shortform note: Researchers suggest that physical and emotional [stress may be the reason behind the sleep disparity](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/whats-connection-between-race-and-sleep-disorders) between people of color and white people. Some of the possible sources of stress include discrimination in the workplace, fear and anger due to racial discrimination, and financial pressure due to unemployment and poverty—stressors that people of color experience to a greater degree than white people. People of color are also more likely to work irregular hours that affect their sleep schedules and may have more limited access to health care, so sleep problems are left untreated.)

Given the complex physiology of insomnia, it’s unlikely blunt instruments like sleeping pills will fix the root cause.

(Shortform note: More middle-aged women are [reporting increasing levels of insomnia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203592/) and are turning to sleeping pills for relief. But studies suggest that using prescription [sleeping pills for one to two years doesn’t improve sleep quality](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210511201131.htm) or duration in this demographic.)

### Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy is a disruption in a normal process. Typically, wakefulness is signaled by the neurotransmitter orexin in the hypothalamus; in sleep, this is shut off. But in narcoleptic patients, 90% of orexin-secreting cells are destroyed, and orexin receptors are downregulated. Walker explains that this insufficient signaling causes the body to exist in a not-awake, not-asleep purgatory throughout the day and night.

People with narcolepsy suffer from three symptoms:

- **Sudden bouts of extreme sleepiness** during the day. Sleep pressure for narcolepsy is far more severe than the typical feelings of sleep deprivation, equivalent to the feeling after three consecutive all-nighters.
- **Sleep paralysis** (waking up in REM sleep during muscle atonia), accompanied by a feeling of dread, stemming from the inability to move in response to a perceived threat. Walker says that sleep paralysis explains many claims of alien abduction (marked by a presence in the room and being paralyzed).
- **Cataplexy**, or the sudden loss of muscle control while awake (as in the head drooping or the knees buckling). This is triggered by strong emotional reactions, to both positive and negative events, such as surprises, playing with kids, or the sound of a car horn. To avoid triggering events, narcoleptics may isolate themselves emotionally.

(Shortform note: [It can be hard to diagnose narcolepsy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/narcolepsy/diagnosis/) because its symptoms overlap with the symptoms of depression, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, and epilepsy, among other conditions. It’s important to rule out other conditions before starting treatment for narcolepsy.)

At the time of the book’s publication, Walker noted that there were no _effective_ treatments for narcolepsy, but there were several treatments that could help narcoleptics manage some of their symptoms:

- Amphetamine or provigil—used for daytime sleepiness
- Antidepressants—for suppressing REM sleep, which helps with sleep paralysis and cataplexy

> **New Treatments for Narcolepsy**
> 
> A few products for treating narcolepsy emerged after the book was published. These include:
> 
> - **[Sunosi](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/946899#vp_1)**—addresses excessive daytime sleepiness by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. As it only treats sleepiness, it’s a more viable treatment option for those with [narcolepsy type 2](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/narcolepsy) (narcolepsy without cataplexy). Those with [narcolepsy type 1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/narcolepsy) (with cataplexy) [may need to use sunosi together with other treatments](https://www.ajmc.com/view/what-we-re-reading-severe-national-blood-shortage-va-to-offer-gender-affirming-surgeries-vulnerable-states-amid-variant-spread) to manage other symptoms.
>     
> - **[Mazindol](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/comment/novel-narcolepsy-product-safety-barriers/)**—has been shown to stimulate activity in orexin receptors and is a promising treatment for both excessive sleepiness and cataplexy. It [may be the first treatment that targets the cause](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/comment/novel-narcolepsy-product-safety-barriers/) of the disease rather than just the symptoms.
