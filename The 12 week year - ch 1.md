## Chapter 1: Success Begins in the Mind

Society tells us that changing our actions leads to better results. This advice is not completely wrong, but the focus is. **A shift in actions without a shift in mindset only leads to marginal improvements.** To truly reach your full potential and achieve your goals, you must change your perspective about the nature of work.

### Annualization Versus Periodization

Real progress cannot be made when you base your execution plan on attaining yearly results. However, most businesses set annual goals and create 12-month plans for increasing profits and productivity. You also do this in your own life. You set New Year’s resolutions on January 1 and commit to changing your life by December 31. But this type of thinking hinders your success and wastes valuable time during the year.

**Annualized thinking is when you set a goal for the end of the year and believe you have all the time in the world to achieve it.** December is beyond comprehension at the start of a new year, so you have no sense of urgency in working toward your goal. You dole out the required steps to achieve your goal over several months, and if you get behind in your plan, you reason you still have months ahead to catch up. This thought becomes the mantra for the rest of the year, and months go by without any implementation of actions that lead to change.

You also assume that despite your lack of efforts during the year, something significant will happen at the beginning of the last quarter to jumpstart your progress. You continue to put off important actions while you wait for this magical surge in productivity to appear in October.

#### The Magic of the Fourth Quarter

A surge in productivity definitely happens in the fourth quarter, but there is nothing magical about it. This surge is called the “year-end push,” wherein the timeline for your plan to come to fruition reaches the final phase, and the proximity of your self-imposed deadline fills you with a new sense of urgency.

For many companies, the last 60 days of the year define their yearly success. Employees are suddenly laser-focused on the tasks required to meet their goals, and procrastination and superfluous activities fall to the side. In fact, most businesses increase production and output by 30% to 40% in the last quarter.

Although December 31 is an arbitrary deadline, it’s still a deadline, and studies show that people are more capable of accomplishing important tasks when there is a ticking clock. **Deadlines redefine your work routine by promoting motivation and accountability.** And the knowledge that you can relax once you’ve crossed the finish line is a big motivator. All your hard work and excessive effort will be rewarded when the year is up, and you can celebrate and look forward to a fresh start in the coming year.

But why wait until November to feel this surge in productivity? Why not create a life where these deadlines and sense of urgency are the norm daily, weekly, and monthly. This shift in time frame is the essence of periodization.

#### The Advantages of Periodization

**When you embrace periodization, you change your long-term year-long plans of attack to shorter periods focused on maximizing one important skill at a time.** The most important aspect of periodization is how you _think_ about your productivity. When you begin to think in shorter periods of achievement, your actions become geared toward super-charged output achievement. This increased output is supported by an immediate and reachable deadline, and the ensuing results are what are known as _breakthroughs_.

Your ability to concentrate on what is most important to achieve your goal increases as distractions, less important activities, and procrastination decrease. Your improved focus and output help deepen your insight on what you’re capable of accomplishing and fills you with confidence. In this way, **you intentionally push past the limits you believed you could achieve and tap into your greatness**.

Short-term achievement accumulates into year-long success. Instead of waiting until December to measure your progress and the success or failure of your efforts, you can ensure you end the year higher than you started because you’ve monitored your progress in 12-week increments.

### Thinking 12 Weeks at a Time

When you truncate your annualized plan into three months, all the hustle and excitement of the year-end push now happens four times a year. **Your deadline is always in sight, so you lose the mantra of “there’s still plenty of time” and get busy immediately.** If you have a slow week, you might be able to make it up the following week, but you know you can’t have too many bad weeks if you’re going to be successful at the end of 12 weeks. This mindset makes every day important and the need to produce results every week vital.

The other benefit of the 12-week year is the relaxation and celebration you look forward to after all your hard work. You now have four opportunities to reflect on your achievements and take a few days off to recharge. And when you come back, you have a fresh slate to begin another 12 weeks of heightened activity. If your first 12 weeks didn’t work out like you’d hoped, you don’t have to wait another year to see whether you’ve improved. **The next 12 weeks are an immediate opportunity to attain better results or build on the momentum of your previous success.**

#### A Holistic System of Operation

You can implement parts of the 12-week year as you see fit, but understand that the full benefits of the system only occur when the execution system is applied as a whole. When all of the elements that guide your thoughts and actions are combined day after day and week after week, the results compound to help you achieve your most optimal level of performance.

**You will be more equipped to succeed in your 12-week process after your initial use of the techniques because you’ll know what to expect.** You’ve also experienced greater results than you thought were possible, which gives you hope for the future. Make the 12-week year your personal operating system for every aspect of your life.

In the chapters that follow, you’ll learn the eight elements that underpin this execution system. These elements have been broken down into two groups to help you see how they support your execution system. The **_disciplines_** of vision, planning, process control, measurement, and time use guide your behaviors during the 12 weeks. The **_principles_** of accountability, commitment, and greatness in the moment guide the changes in mindset required to effectively execute the 12-week plan.
