## Shortform Introduction

Despite its title, _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ isn’t about not giving any f_cks; rather, it’s about giving f_cks about the right things.

**Modern society tells us to care deeply about everything.** We’re constantly told that we don’t have enough money, enough friends, enough stuff, or enough experiences—just consider how many “50 things you have to read/watch/see before you die” articles are out there.

Furthermore, the modern self-help movement teaches us that we should always feel happy and positive, and so when we _don’t_ feel happy, we think we’re somehow failing. We feel constantly judged, both by others and by ourselves.

Therefore, the purpose of this book is to focus your f*cks; in other words, **to help you identify what’s both _truly important_ and _within your control._** By focusing your energy and attention on those things, you’ll find purpose and real happiness, rather than the shallow “good vibes” that the self-help movement would have you pursue.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: [HarperCollins Publishers](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck-mark-manson)

Imprint: [HarperOne](https://harperone.com/9780062457714/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck/)

_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,_ published in 2016, grew out of Manson’s [2015 blog post of the same title](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck). It was Manson’s second book, preceded by _[Models: Attract Women Through Honesty](https://markmanson.net/books/models)_ (2011). _The_ _Subtle Art_ was his first bestselling hit and paved the way for a follow-up book, _[Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/everything-is-fcked-mark-manson)_ (2019), which, building on the popularity of _The Subtle Art_, debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list.

### The Book’s Context

_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ pushes back against the modern self-help movement, which author Mark Manson believes focuses too much on _feeling good_, rather than _living well_. This book argues instead that hardships are what give our lives meaning, that it’s impossible to be happy all the time, and that chasing endless positivity makes us focus on all the wrong things.

Manson mainly draws inspiration from three different philosophical traditions:

1. **Stoicism,** which rejects chasing shallow emotions (such as “feeling good”) in favor of living by logic and duty.
2. **Existentialism,** which focuses on personal growth through deliberate choices and acts of willpower.
3. **Buddhism,** which is rooted in the idea that suffering exists; but that it will end, and that you have the power to end your own suffering.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list. Many have praised Manson for his straightforward advice, and for going against the sugarcoated feel-good trends of other modern self-help books. The Huffington Post called _Subtle Art_ [“deeply inspiring,”](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-subtle-art-of-not-giv_b_12012008) while Kirkus Reviews praised it as a [benchmark to compare other self-help books to](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mark-manson/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck/).

However, some have criticized the book for [a lack of empirical evidence](https://roselandj.medium.com/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck-mark-mansons-theory-of-personal-growth-97076ea27b85) to back up its many assertions. Along the same lines, some of Manson’s critics argue that he’s just using his own life experiences to provide catch-all advice, which won’t work for many people.

Reviewers on Amazon have also blasted Manson for what they call a shallow understanding of Buddhism and Stoicism; they argue that anyone with even a basic grounding in philosophy won’t find anything new or interesting in _Subtle Art_.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Manson takes a blunt, no-nonsense approach in this book. He tells readers plainly that they’re _not_ special, that they _are_ sometimes going to struggle and fail, and that sooner or later they’re going to die—**and that all of that is okay.**

_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ is a prime example of Manson’s signature writing style: conversational, to-the-point, and vulgar. In terms of content, it also follows Manson’s usual theme of getting what you want in life through hard work, brutal honesty, and constant self-improvement (instead of tricks, mind games, or “good vibes”).

Manson’s “tough love” approach isn’t for everyone; some readers will find him harsh and abrasive. However, others may appreciate this book’s brutal honesty and realism among all of the more stereotypical feel-good advice from other self-help writers.

#### Our Approach in This Guide

This guide has two main sections:

1. **Laying the groundwork** (Chapters 1-4), where we explain what Manson means by “not giving a f*ck,” and why you’d want to do that in the first place.
2. **Giving the right f*cks** (Chapters 5-9), devoted to what Manson calls his “five counterintuitive good values.” Those five values will help you to give f*cks about the right things, while ignoring the things that distract or mislead you.

Since _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ draws from several established philosophies, we’ll expand and clarify the book’s messages by tracing their origins to those schools of thought. We’ll also explore some of the psychology behind what motivates people’s decisions, and why we’re driven to give so many f*cks about so many unimportant things.
