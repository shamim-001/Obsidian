## 1972

This is the year they announce Nike at the National Sporting Goods Association Show in Chicago. Right before this, Onitsuka publicly announces they’d acquired Blue Ribbon. This is a bluff to pressure them to sell.

For their debut, Phil wants to package shoes in bright orange boxes to stand out. When they receive the shoes, the boxes look great, but the shoes inside are terrible – they look cheap and shiny, and logos are crooked.

They think they’re doomed, but people crowd around, asking questions and actually buying shoes. What’s going on? The salesmen have been doing business with Blue Ribbon for years, and they know Blue Ribbon isn’t a fraud. Their reputation precedes them.

Word travels to Japan, and Kitami from Onitsuka shows up two weeks later. “What’s Nike?” he asks. Phil responds that it’s a backup in case Onitsuka cuts ties with Blue Ribbon. He lies that Nike isn’t currently yet in stores. Kitami travels to Blue Ribbon’s Los Angeles store to inspect. The store manager Bork is instructed by Phil Knight to deceive Kitami, but he finds hundreds of Nike boxes in the storage room. The gig is up.

A bit later, Kitami shows up with a lawyer. He formally voids Blue Ribbon’s contract with Onitsuka, citing the Nike play as a breach. Kitami has the gall to request Bowerman’s services as a consultant, which of course they refuse.

The next day, Phil addresses his team. He shares news that Onitsuka has terminated their contract, and they may have to face lawsuits for breach of contract. And they’ve got an uphill battle – Nike shoes have quality problems, and they have little margin for error. Everyone looks dejected, especially as there’s an economic recession going on. But Phil rallies the team, saying this is the moment they’ve been waiting for. The chance to make their own brand, and break free of Onitsuka’s limitations. This inspires the crew, and they begin the fight for survival.

In preparation for the 1972 Olympics, the US track-and-field trials are held in Eugene, OR. The central event is Steve Prefontaine, qualifying for the 5000m event. Phil reflects on why Pre is a running celebrity like the country had never seen, and he attributes it to Pre’s passion. Pre always pushes himself to the limit. “No matter the sport – no matter the human endeavor – total effort will win people’s hearts.” Pre’s world-record-setting performance at the trials pushes Phil to fight for Nike’s life.

Bowerman is the head coach of the US Olympics track team that year. But the 1972 Munich Olympics end tragically in a terrorist event and the deaths of Israeli athletes. Bowerman retires from coaching soon after.

But 1972 ends with victories for Nike. Knowing that athlete endorsements are important, Nike signs tennis player Ilie Nastase, who is already wearing Nike Match Points. And the year ends with the University of Oregon Ducks, all clad in Nike waffle shoes, against their rival Oregon State Beavers. Phil feels immense pride in having made the players’ shoes leading to their win.
