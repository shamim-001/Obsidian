In JavaScript, both `undefined` and `null` represent the absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have different behaviors:

1. **`undefined`**: This is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but not initialized with a value. It also represents the default return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let x;
   console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined

   function foo() {}
   console.log(foo()); // Outputs: undefined
   ```

2. **`null`**: This is also a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or property should have no value.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let y = null;
   console.log(y); // Outputs: null

   const person = {
       name: 'John',
       age: null // Indicates that age is intentionally not set
   };
   ```

In practical terms:
- If you encounter `undefined`, it usually indicates that something is declared but not yet defined or initialized.
- If you use `null`, it typically signifies that you are intentionally setting a variable, property, or parameter to have no value.

It's important to note that both `undefined` and `null` are falsy values, meaning they evaluate to `false` in boolean contexts. However, they are distinct concepts and should be used appropriately based on their intended meaning in your code.
