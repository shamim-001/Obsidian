## Chapter 2: Charismatic Leadership

One hundred years after the advent of the culture of personality, **we’ve elevated extroversion to hyper-extroversion and equated it with leadership**. It permeates the self-improvement industry, business schools, corporate culture, and even churches. But charismatic leaders aren’t as effective as most people think—in some circumstances, introverted leaders may be more effective.

Today’s hyper-extrovert is personified by self-help guru Tony Robbins, whose high-energy workshops on building self-confidence (the $895 four-day entry-level session is called “Unleash the Power Within”) draw thousands. They culminate in a voluntary walk across hot coals.

Robbins has a “hyperthermic” or extreme extrovert temperament characterized by one psychiatrist as “exuberant, upbeat, over-energetic, and overconfident”—which are traits touted as assets in business, particularly sales. Indeed, Robbins is a salesman, constantly urging attendees at his sessions to buy additional higher-priced packages.

At first, the culture of personality urged people to develop an extrovert personality to stand out from competitors. Robbins’s message, however, is that extroversion not only ensures success but also makes you a better person. Selling yourself is a way of contributing to the world. In this view, what some might see as hucksterism is the ultimate in leadership.

### Elevating Extrovert Leaders

Harvard Business School, which trains many nationally prominent business and political leaders, starts with a premise of hyper-extroversion. The curriculum forces students to be extroverts, in keeping with the findings of a study that verbal ability and sociability are the most important determinants of success in a corporate culture.

Participation in learning teams or study groups is mandatory, as is class participation. Students who speak up frequently and forcefully are viewed as leaders or players. Because leaders in business must confidently make decisions on incomplete information, in Harvard’s view, students must take positions and defend them forcefully regardless of how confident they are in the positions.

In fact, hyper-extroversion is central to many company cultures. As a manager at General Electric explained, you can’t have a casual conversation—everything you say and how you say it is a presentation. People try to look like extroverts, whether they are or not, which in terms of sociability can mean being sure to work out at the same health club as the CEO and drinking his favorite drink.

In essence, our culture continues to promote the same personal qualities as in the 1920s, except to a greater extreme. We have even stronger anti-anxiety drugs to help. For instance, in 2000, Paxil was marketed as a cure for social anxiety disorder. One ad showed a business executive, presumably with a boost from Paxil, concluding a deal. The caption was, “I can taste success.”

### Downsides of Extroversion in Business

**One problem with worshipping a decisive, forceful leadership style is that it can lead to less-than-optimal decisions,** as a traditional class exercise at Harvard demonstrates.

In the exercise, called the Subarctic Survival Situation, students imagine being survivors of a plane crash in the arctic. They’re assigned to groups, which must rank fifteen salvaged items in order of their importance to the group’s survival. In an instance recounted in _Quiet_, one group ignored a quiet classmate who was an expert in wilderness survival, deferring instead to the views of more talkative, less-knowledgeable students, which resulted in a lower group score.

Studies of group dynamics show that we view talkers as smarter than quiet people and as leaders. We rate fast talkers as more capable than slower ones. **The more someone talks, the more attention he draws from the group and the more influential he becomes** as the discussion progresses.

But more talk doesn’t translate to greater insight. In one study, in which groups of college students solved math problems and rated each others’ intelligence, those who spoke first and most often got the highest ratings, yet their contributions were no better than those of quieter students.

Sometimes, when people do something because they were carried away by the most vocal person in a group, they end up wondering later, “What were we thinking?” The U.S. Army has a metaphor for the phenomenon: “taking the bus to Abilene.” It works like this:

A group is sitting around on a porch in Texas feeling bored and someone says, “Why don’t we go to Abilene?” They all go, but when they get there, someone else says, “You know, I didn’t really want to do this.” Others admit, “I didn’t either—I thought you wanted to.” In the Army, whenever people are unthinkingly jumping on a bandwagon, anyone can put the brakes on the conversation by saying, ”I think we’re getting on the bus to Abilene.”

The bias toward talkers also plays out in the way businesses and venture capitalists sometimes value presentation skills over substance. In his book _Iconoclast_, Gregory Berns recounts how a software company seeking new product ideas countered the management’s tendency to be swayed by a flashy performance. Instead of having employees present new ideas to a panel of judges, the company solicits ideas via an online “idea market,” where the focus is on substance.

### Extrovert Leaders in Church

**Like Harvard Business School, many evangelical churches promote the Extrovert Ideal in both leaders and parishioners**. They prize extroversion because they view the church’s mission as proselytizing, outreach, and community-building, which are social pursuits. They even associate extroversion with godliness.

For example, Saddleback Church in California, one of the largest evangelical churches in the country, is built on the culture of personality. Extroversion is a prerequisite for leadership and services and activities are built around social interaction: attendees are personally greeted and services are participative and boisterous. Members are urged to join a range of groups and activities targeted to various topics and interests, such as cooking and sports. Sharing one’s faith is part of practicing it.

However, this approach is off-putting to many potential leaders and members, according to Adam McHugh, an introvert and a Presbyterian minister who aims to make churches more comfortable for introverts. In his book, _Introverts in the Church: Finding our Place in an Extroverted Culture_, he argues that practicing one’s faith should involve listening as well as talking and that silent prayer and contemplation should have a larger place.

### Extroversion in Leaders Is Overrated

When you look at how businesses actually function, the Harvard Business School model of the charismatic, extrovert leader is overrated.

A Brigham Young study of 128 CEOs of major companies found that those viewed as charismatic didn’t perform any better than less-charismatic leaders, although they were paid more. **Much of the time, leaders don’t actually need to be overly outgoing to be effective**, one Harvard management professor conceded. Leaders communicate more often in small-group meetings, emails, and videos than by making presentations to large groups. Although big presentations are important—and leaders need presentation skills—they’re not daily requirements.

Many introverts have been outstanding leaders, including Charles Schwab, Bill Gates, Lou Gerstner of IBM, and Sara Lee CEO Brenda Barnes.

Management expert Peter Drucker wrote that the most effective CEOs he encountered actually lacked charisma. Similarly, _Good to Great_ author Jim Collins, who studied high-performing companies, found that the best CEOs were known for a combination of humility and determination rather than charisma. (Shortform note: [Read our summary of Good to Great here](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/good-to-great).)

For example, CEO Darwin Smith of paper company Kimberly-Clark was shy and mild-mannered. However, despite opposition, he made the courageous decision to sell the paper mills producing coated paper and shift the company’s focus to consumer products. This ended up strengthening the company. Collins concluded that corporations don’t need outsized personalities—they need leaders who focus, not on stroking their egos, but on building the business.

### Comparing Introvert and Extrovert Leaders

**Introverted leaders perform better than extroverted leaders in certain circumstances,** according to research by Wharton School professor Adam Grant.

In one study, he and his colleagues analyzed profits of one of the largest pizza chains in the U.S. and found that: 1) stores with extroverted leaders delivered 16% higher profits when employees were passive and did what they were told, and 2) stores with introverted leaders delivered 14% higher profits over the stores led by extroverts when employees proactively worked to improve procedures.

In a second study in which teams of college students competed to fold the most t-shirts, the teams with introverted leaders were more effective when the team members were proactive and came up with a way to do the work faster. Teams led by extroverts were more effective when the teams passively followed the leader’s direction.

Researchers concluded that **introverts are effective at leading proactive employees because they tend to listen and are more willing to implement suggestions** as opposed to dominating the situation.

Also, in the t-shirt folding study, the introvert-led teams reported they were motivated to work harder by the leader’s openness to their input. In contrast, extrovert leaders may be so focused on doing things their way that they don’t hear suggestions. However, extroverts also have the ability to inspire passive employees to perform better.

Grant argues that **it’s important for companies to have both listeners and talkers as leaders in order to maximize employee output**.

### A New Type of Leader?

Technology and the internet have created a new, non-face-to-face environment for communicating, in which introverts may excel as leaders. **Social media platforms enable a form of leadership different from the Harvard Business School model**.

For instance, introvert Craig Newmark has successfully connected millions of people through his online platform Craigslist. Besides being a place to exchange services, his website functions as a sort of public commons. It connected stranded people with help during Hurricane Katrina and helped people find rides during New York City’s 2005 transit strike. Newmark has written that his site has the ability to connect people “to fix the world.”

**The online world lets introverts play a more social role than they’re comfortable with in person**. Studies have shown that introverts are more likely than extroverts to provide personal facts about themselves online and enter into certain online discussions. In addition, they’re more likely to say they can express who they really are online.

The online environment may yield better results for some activities by allowing introverts to communicate effectively without being overshadowed by more talkative types. For instance, consider how differently Harvard’s Subarctic Survival exercise might turn out if extrovert and introvert opinions got equal time.
