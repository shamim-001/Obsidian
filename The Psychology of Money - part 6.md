## Part 6: How to Pay Attention to the Right Financial Information

Sticking to a long-term financial strategy doesn’t just require you to understand the mindsets above—it also requires you to know how the information you encounter affects your decisions so that you can make better decisions. In this section, we’ll share Housel’s two lessons that help ensure you pay attention to the right information: Know your personal financial goals, and be careful what stories you believe about money.

### Lesson #17: Know Your Personal Financial Goals

In Chapter 16, Housel argues that one way to ensure you pay attention to the right information is to **know what financial goals matter to you personally** so that you don’t get caught up chasing the goals of other people. In other words, don’t get caught up in a herd mentality chasing investment opportunities that lots of other people are chasing, just because others are doing it.

Housel explains that when you know your financial goals, you can ignore irrelevant information that might lead you to make poor decisions, such as basing your financial moves on others’ actions, and thus you’re able to make better financial decisions and better protect your financial health.

To demonstrate the risks of paying attention to the wrong information, Housel points to the economic devastation caused by bubbles. A bubble is an economic situation where an asset price becomes significantly higher than the asset’s actual worth. It causes harm, Housel argues, because during a bubble, long-term investors base their financial decisions on information they don’t realize is only relevant to short-term traders.

Housel explains that in a bubble, short-term traders set the price of an asset class: They see an increasing asset price and purchase it, assuming it will continue to increase. Their purchase pushes the price up more, which attracts more short-term traders—until most of the people invested in a particular asset class are short-term traders, which is when the bubble forms. When this happens, the price the short-term traders are willing to pay for an asset becomes the only price at which it’s available.

Housel explains that this price is reasonable for a short-term trader but _not_ reasonable for a long-term investor. A short-term trader who cares only that the asset price rises in a few hours or days can reasonably purchase assets at a much higher price than a long-term investor, who wants any asset she buys to continue increasing for decades.

(Shortform note: So how do you determine what is a reasonable price for an asset? Housel doesn’t recommend a formula, but one way is to [follow the 50/30/20 budgeting strategy](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-much-can-i-spend-each-month): Spend 50% of your take-home pay on what you need, 30% on what you want, and 20% on savings and debt. With this strategy, you wouldn’t invest in any assets that cost more than your 20% savings budget for the month.)

Unfortunately, long-term investors often don’t realize that the asset price available in a bubble doesn’t make sense for their own goals. They mistakenly assume that since others are buying at that price, they should also buy at that price. When the bubble inevitably bursts, their long-term plans suffer dramatically.

> **How the Information Age Impacts Our Investing Decisions**
> 
> Past bubbles—like the dot-com bubble Housel discusses—mostly occurred before the Internet was widely available: People got limited information from the radio or TV. But we now have constant access to unlimited information: How does this affect our experience of bubbles?~~ ~~

~~> ~~In some ways, t[he Internet has made bubbles more dangerous for unsuspecting investors](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/06/what-the-gamestop-craziness-could-mean-for-the-stock-markets-future.html). Experts note that bubbles are bigger and faster than they used to be, partly because investing apps make it easy to invest. They add that novice investors are often drawn to the market via social media posts about investing. These posts are often irrelevant to the novice’s goals—so if she doesn’t do extra research, she may risk more than she can afford to lose.

> However, the Internet may also have made us less susceptible to bubbles. Experts explain that [we’re now better at filtering out irrelevant information](https://www.fastcompany.com/3045317/what-is-generation-z-and-what-does-it-want)—so long-term investors may be better at ignoring what short-term investors are doing. Furthermore, as [personalization algorithms dominate news apps and social media](https://niemanreports.org/articles/the-power-of-personalization/), we encounter mostly information we already care about. If you’re not interested in investing to begin with, you may be less likely to encounter information about a developing bubble and thus less likely to fall for one.

To avoid a similar fate, Housel argues, you must be consciously aware of your financial goals so that you can pay attention to the right information. One strategy Housel recommends is to **write a mission statement for your finances**. Ask yourself: How long are you going to invest your money? What do you think is going to happen over that time? What risks are you willing to take?

(Shortform note: The questions Housel recommends to discover your financial goals focus mostly on your investments. But how can you pay attention to the right information in other areas of your life? Consider [writing a financial mission statement that encompasses not just investing but other areas of your life](https://womenwhomoney.medium.com/what-is-a-financial-mission-statement-why-and-how-do-i-create-one-fce2be00c7a9#:~:text=Here%20is%20an%20example%20of,our%20gifts%20to%20local%20charities.).)

Once you discover your financial goals, Housel contends, you’ll have a far easier time ignoring irrelevant information. Instead, you’ll pay attention only to information that’s relevant to _your_ financial goals—and as such, you’ll make better decisions as you pursue them.

(Shortform note: Paying attention to only relevant information may improve your decisions—but not if you pay attention to too much. In _[Smarter Faster Better](https://shortform.com/app/book/smarter-faster-better/),_ productivity expert Charles Duhigg posits that [we may grow overwhelmed by the amount of data available and stop taking it in](https://shortform.com/app/book/smarter-faster-better/chapter-6). To prevent this, the author recommends acting on the data you encounter—like writing it out by hand.)

### Lesson #18: Be Careful What Stories You Believe About Money

Maintaining your financial success isn’t just about understanding what information matters to you; it's also about understanding the power of information in general. In Chapter 18, Housel posits that stories drive our decisions more effectively than statistics**—**so if you fall for an incorrect story, you're prone to making poor financial decisions**.** Therefore, Housel warns, you must **be careful what stories you believe about money**.

To illustrate how stories affect our financial decisions more than objective factors—like our ability to grow wealth—Housel points to how the United States’ economic situation differed between 2007 and 2009. Many of the seemingly objective factors were better in 2009 than in 2007: We had and were capable of more thanks to things like advancements in technology. But 2009's economy was far worse than 2007's because, according to Housel, we were reacting to a different story. In 2007, we believed that housing prices would keep rising; by 2009, we were experiencing the fallout that occurred when people stopped believing that story.

> **How Stories Affect the Objective Factors That Matter**
> 
> Housel uses the same story about the difference between the United States’ economic situation in 2009 and 2007 to begin [a 2017 report that describes the power stories have to affect our financial decisions](https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/The%20Greatest%20Story%20Ever%20Told%20--Collaborative%20Fund.pdf). Many sections of the report are practically identical to sections of his book. However, Housel makes one key claim in this report that he doesn’t mention in his book: He argues that every economic asset, like a career or a company’s value, depends on both its actual ability to deliver value and how much people _believe_ in that ability—and that the second factor influences the first. For example, he notes, people believe that Amazon will drive technological change, so top engineers flock to Amazon—and so, Amazon has the talent it needs to drive technological change. In other words, stories may affect our financial decisions more than objective factors, but the stories can change those objective factors, too.

#### How Stories Influence Your Decisions

How, exactly, does falling for an incorrect story worsen your financial decisions? Housel posits that there are two main reasons.

**#1: The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to make financial decisions as if that thing is true—and the more you’ll risk your financial health.**

Housel argues that in any high-stakes situation where you have little control, like investing, your desire for a story to be true often drives you to behave as if that story is true—no matter how improbable. But if the story _isn_’t true, acting on it can have detrimental financial effects. For example, in 2021, [many people lost their life savings in the volatile cryptocurrency market](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/19/life-savings-in-crypto-generation-of-amateurs-hooked-on-high-risk-trading): They _wanted_ cryptocurrency to make them money, so they believed it definitely _would_ make them money.

(Shortform note: If you’re desperate for something to be true, you might also increase your belief in it by surrounding yourself with people who believe the same thing you do—which is [easier than ever thanks to the ability to connect to various niche groups online](https://nautil.us/issue/69/patterns/why-misinformation-is-about-who-you-trust-not-what-you-think). And if everybody around you is doing something, [it’s far easier for you to convince yourself to do it too](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/after-service/201705/the-science-behind-why-people-follow-the-crowd).)

Housel contends that when you’re planning for the future, you’re emotionally invested, and that makes you highly susceptible to attractive stories. The more you _want_ something to be true, the more evidence you’ll find to support your opinion—so the more likely you are to become too convinced that an improbable financial future will definitely occur. And if you do, the margin of safety you build into your financial plan might not encompass what happens at all.

(Shortform note: To avoid such a fate, consider following Taleb’s strategy in _[The Black Swan](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan/)_ of [“negative empiricism”: the process of seeking out information that disproves your original belief](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan/chapter-3). By doing so, the less likely you may be to become too convinced of an improbable financial future, and the more margin of safety you’ll build into your financial plan.)

**#2: Stories make you confident that you have control when you don’t.**

According to Housel, we often don’t realize we don’t understand a situation we’re in. This is because, as Housel notes, we create a reasonable explanation that makes sense to us, and we never think to question it. For example, you may see an old man sitting alone on your commute every day, assume he’s on his way to his job, and feel bad that he’s unable to retire. However, he might actually be financially independent and on his way to yoga at his gym—but you never question the story you created, so you never realize it’s wrong.

Housel posits that we make up explanations because it makes us feel like our chaotic world is more predictable and controllable than it is. For example, Housel notes, we continue to pay attention to market forecasts—even though investors generally agree they’re useless—because it’s comforting to believe that the smart person on TV knows what’s going to happen to your money.

(Shortform note: In _[The Black Swan](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan/)_, Taleb suggests a biological reason we narrativize situations: [Interpreting information makes it easier for our brains to store](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan/chapter-3). For example, whereas retaining 100 randomly ordered numbers would be near impossible, retaining 100 numbers that were ordered according to a specific rule would be much easier. So when we interpret—or narrativize—we’re attempting to impose our own organizing rule on the random facts of the world.)

Unfortunately, finance _isn’t_ as predictable or controllable as we want it to be. Since it’s subject to the whims of human emotions, it doesn’t follow easy, logical rules like science does—and so you don’t have as much control as you want over what happens to your money. When you overestimate how much control you have, you’re likely to ignore factors like chance or others’ decisions and may make poor financial decisions as a result.

For example, Housel cites how entrepreneurs are overwhelmingly—and incorrectly—confident that their success depends at least 80% on factors within their control. They underestimate critical external factors they’re not intimately aware of, like their competitors’ plans, and instead create a story of success based mostly on their own knowledge. Although Housel doesn’t explicitly state that this mistaken belief drives these entrepreneurs to make poor decisions, we can infer that it might: If you don’t think your competitors’ plans will greatly impact your ability to succeed, for example, you likely won’t pay as much attention to them as you should.

(Shortform note: Entrepreneurs may be especially prone to overestimating how much they control their success—and consequently, how likely they are to succeed—because, as one psychologist suggests, [the people who become entrepreneurs tend to be more optimistic in general](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/201610/4-ways-in-which-optimism-helps-entrepreneurs-succeed#:~:text=are%20depressingly%20small.%20While%20statistics,in%20pointing%20out%20how%20hard%20it%20is%20to). After all, 96% of US businesses fail within 10 years, so to become an entrepreneur to begin with suggests that you’re more optimistic than most people—and may mean that you think you have more control over your life than the average person.)
