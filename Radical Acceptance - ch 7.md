## Chapter 7: Radical Acceptance of Fear

This chapter begins much like the last one. This time we discuss the emotion of fear—why we experience it, why it’s necessary, and how to avoid becoming overwhelmed by it.

As always, Radical Acceptance is the key to meeting the experience of fear without getting swept away in it; however, we must also recognize that sometimes fear is too extreme to face alone. **Therefore, this chapter also begins discussing the importance of community in our spiritual practice.**

### What Fear Really Is

Like desire, fear is a natural force that helps keep us alive. Fear warns us of danger and prepares us—physically and mentally—to run, fight, or hide from it. In its purest form, fear is a desire for life and an aversion to death.

However, fear often goes beyond what’s needed to keep us alive. We may find ourselves tense and on guard, even when there’s no threat to our safety. Our minds may be working constantly, trying to figure out what will go wrong next. **When this is the case, we’re in a state of defending our lives rather than living them.**

The emotion of fear comes with powerful physical responses as well. Blood rushes to our extremities, our muscles tense, and we produce chemicals that heighten our awareness and physical abilities. We curl in on ourselves both physically and emotionally, protecting our most vulnerable areas.

When fear is a core part of who we are, this withdrawal becomes a habit. We might not even notice it in ourselves because it feels normal. However, people around us might see that we’re hunched over, our shoulders raised, our heads thrust forward in an unconscious attempt to protect ourselves.

Furthermore, the effect isn’t just physical. Fear also creates rigid, habitual thought patterns. **The intense focus that helps us respond to real threats becomes obsession.** Our minds, which are hardwired to look for patterns, tell us endless stories about what could go wrong and how we might avoid it.

We always place ourselves at the center of those stories. We tell ourselves that we’re alone, helpless, that we have to do something in order to take control. We start using survival strategies: Perhaps we try to be small and quiet, to avoid notice; or perhaps we go the other way, and lash out angrily to gain power over the situation. Like our desires, our deepest fears and our responses to them are often shaped by what we experienced as children.

#### The Trance of Fear

**Fear can carry us into a trance just like desire can and for the same reasons.** Children often make sense of hurtful or frightening situations by blaming themselves, and that habit carries over into adulthood along with the fear. We aren’t just afraid; we’re afraid that we’re going to be punished for something, or we feel like we made a mistake and left ourselves vulnerable.

We’re in the trance of fear when worry and anxiety prevent us from existing fully in the moment. When we’re constantly withdrawn and tense, when our minds are hyperaware of our surroundings and telling us that these feelings are our own fault, we can’t accept and live our experiences.

As always, we can awaken from the trance by practicing mindfulness, beginning with the physical sensations we’re experiencing. We can observe that our hearts are racing, our hands are shaking, or that we feel too tightly wound—as if we might be about to spring into action or flee the situation. Identify each sensation, welcome it, and allow it to pass.

**When we examine our fear and welcome it, we’ll come to understand that it’s not something we created—it’s not our fault.** Like any other experience, we can allow the fear to rise up and fade away without affecting us. That allows us to tackle the source of the fear—the problem—with clarity and understanding.

### Finding Refuge

While mindfulness and Radical Acceptance are effective ways out of the trance of fear, sometimes the fear is so intense that it seems impossible to face—it feels like inviting it in will destroy us. When that happens, we need to find sources of safety and strength that will allow us to overcome the fear.

Usually the easiest and most accessible way is to find people who can help. A friend, a teacher, or a therapist can often offer the support we need to look at our fears without being overwhelmed by them. **When we face intense fear, it’s helpful to be reminded that we’re part of something greater than our fearful selves.**

However, while seeking outside help is a good (and sometimes necessary) first step, ideally we’ll want to find that feeling of safety and belonging inside ourselves. Buddhism provides three fundamental refuges that we can retreat to for strength and peace.

**1) The first refuge is the Buddha.** Exactly what that means varies from person to person. For some people it’s the man Siddhartha Gautama, who faced Mara under the bodhi tree and reached enlightenment. For others it’s the Buddha’s enlightened heart and mind—much like a Christian might pray to Jesus or Mary, a buddhist might experience the Buddha as a higher power or presence that loves and cares for us all.

However, the real power of the Buddha’s story is in the idea that any of us could accomplish similar feats. Siddhartha was much like us before his awakening, and we have the same potential for enlightenment that he had. Therefore, the essence of taking refuge in Buddha is having faith in ourselves, in our own ability to awaken from the trance and reach enlightenment. In that sense, we might consider “the Buddha” to be our own Buddha nature.

**2) The second refuge is _dharma_**. Dharma is a Sanskrit word meaning natural laws, the way of things, or the truth. Seeking refuge in dharma means accepting and taking comfort in the knowledge that everything changes. It also means understanding that, in trying to cling to our pleasant experiences and fight our unpleasant ones, we put ourselves deeper into the trance of fear.

**3) The third refuge is _sangha,_ meaning community.** Traditionally it means the spiritual community, the other aspirants who share your struggles and your search for spiritual freedom. More recently, particularly in Western cultures, it’s come to mean anyone who helps you pursue your own awakening. For example, seeing a therapist or talking to a friend with whom you can be open and vulnerable are two ways of taking refuge in sangha.

Sangha can also mean a larger community, not just the people in your immediate circle. This is closer to the original meaning, where you can take comfort from knowing that there are many people in the world who share your struggles and your hopes. Facing a personal fear is isolating; facing a shared fear makes us feel connected.

We all experience our fears differently, so each of us find one refuge or another more comforting or easier to access. It’s important to find what works for you.

Like all spiritual practices, developing a real sense of safety and belonging can take time—possibly years. However, doing so can transform how we relate to our fears. Once we don’t feel overwhelmed anymore, we can start meeting fear with Radical Acceptance.

A side note: For some people, meditation and mindfulness alone aren’t enough. Medication is a fiercely debated topic in many spiritual communities, but some people may find that they need it in order to gain control over their fears or other experiences.

**For someone whose experiences are too overwhelming, medication can be the kindest response.** Such treatments can work hand in hand with spiritual practice to help people overcome anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. By reducing the impact of those experiences, medications can help people to take the necessary pause and recognize what’s happening inside their bodies.
