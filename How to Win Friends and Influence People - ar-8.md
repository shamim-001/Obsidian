## Arguments 8: Start With What You Agree On

### Principles

- Every time someone says “no,” they get locked into defensiveness and the desire to be consistent. Inertia builds. It becomes harder to dislodge them. Even if they later realize they need to change their mind, their precious pride gets in the way. Admitting fault is hard for most people
- **So don’t start by talking about the areas in which you differ. Start with what you agree on.** Get the person saying “yes.”
- Instead of pushing your conclusion on the person, **guide her toward your conclusion through a series of logical questions**.
    - Start with areas of common agreement - common goals, standards of measurement. Then build on layers of understanding by asking more detailed questions.
    - This also lets the other person feel the idea is theirs, since you’re not pushing the idea on them.
    - (Shortform note: This can sound pedantic to people who realize what you’re doing. It’s better to do this in a genuine, patient tone, instead of in the tone of already knowing the answers. Ask difficult questions with unclear answers so it doesn’t feel like you’re trapping the person in a corner.)

### Tactics

- Emphasize that you’re both reaching for the same goals, and that your difference is one of method and not of purpose.
- Combine this with talking in terms of the other person’s interests. “I understand that X is annoying to do. But wouldn’t you want to enjoy benefit Y?“
- Ask high-level questions they’re likely to agree to. “Are you someone who likes to save money?” “Are you someone who cares about performance at all costs?” “It sounds like you need to balance a lot of considerations here, is that right?”

### Examples

- A bank customer came in to open a bank account but refused to answer a few questions about next of kin. The teller agreed: “You’re right. This information isn’t totally necessary. But imagine this - you pass away, and you have money in the bank. Wouldn’t you rather have the bank transfer it to the right person?”
- A customer of a motor company complained to a salesman about the temperature of the motors. It was burning his hand but the actual temperature was well under regulation.
    - Approach 1: “You’re wrong. Measure the temperature. The guidelines say it cannot be more than 72 degrees above room temperature. Let me know what you find.”
    - Approach 2: “I agree with you 100% - if these motors are running too hot, it’s our mistake and you shouldn’t buy any more. Now let me make sure I understand. You can’t have motors running hotter than the national guidelines - is that right?”
        - “Yes.”
        - “The guidelines say the motor can’t exceed 72 degrees above room temp. Is that right?”
        - “Yes, but your motors are much hotter.”
        - (Don’t disagree.) “How hot is this room?”
        - “About 75F.”
        - “That makes 147F. If you put your hand in 147F water, wouldn’t you scald your hand?”
        - “Yes.”
        - “It seems that our hands will always hurt above a certain temperature.”
