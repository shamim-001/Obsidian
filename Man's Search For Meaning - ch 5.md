## Chapter 5: Challenges in Finding Meaning

The last chapter reviewed a few ways to find meaning in your life. But if it sounds easy, it isn’t--**many people get frustrated in their pursuit of meaning**. It is, after all, a lot of responsibility to bear, and the responsibility rests solely on your shoulders.

Just as every individual is unique and has her own unique purpose, every generation has its own unique psychological obsession, and for us right now, it’s a form of nihilism, or the belief that life is meaningless.

- This could be because of determinism: we think our outcomes are already decided for us, so what meaning is there to find in something we can’t change?
- It could also be because life is transitory--we’re going to die anyway, so what meaning can there possibly be?

Let’s learn more about nihilism, how we suffer from it, and why.

### Nihilism

Again, nihilism is the belief that life is meaningless. The nihilism we suffer from today is a personal, private one that each individual suffers alone. After all, there can be little camaraderie in the idea that everything’s meaningless.

Logotherapy calls our specific nihilism _existential frustration_. People generally get existentially frustrated in 3 different ways:

- They’re frustrated with existence in and of itself, specifically the human existence.
    - Frustration with _everything it takes to exist as a human from moment to moment,_ i.e. “why do I have to do all this?”
- They’re frustrated with the meaning of existence.
    - Asking _why humans exist at all and for what purpose_, i.e. “why are we here at all?”
- They’re frustrated with the meaning of their personal existence.
    - Someone struggling to _find the purpose and meaning of their own life,_ “i.e. what am I here for?”

Once you fall into one of those frustrations, **you can start to feel empty, distant, and aimless, and it gets harder to pull yourself out of this emotional place**. Logotherapy refers to this place as an _existential vacuum._

- This was a significant phenomenon of the 20th century: a survey at the time of the 1992 edition showed that 25% of Frankl’s European students felt frustrated by existence and questioned their life’s meaning. Among Frankl’s American students, the percentage was an overwhelming 60%. And it’s not like it’s decreased in the 21st century.

**Our frustrations with existence primarily surface when we’re bored.** “Sunday Neurosis” is a depression that affects people who get through a very busy week only to reach Sunday and, in their boredom, realize how discontent they are with their lives, that there’s some inner void that isn’t filled. And, of course, with the continuing rise of automation, many of our day-to-day purposes will be stripped from us--robots will do our jobs. That plus extended life expectancies mean that we might hopefully have many years of old age when we don’t have a larger societal purpose like a job.

Prolonged existential frustration can lead to depression, aggression, addiction, or neuroses, which are mental fixations that result in different symptoms of stress.

- Depression and even suicide are tied to a feeling of meaninglessness, and get worse the longer someone remains in this existential vacuum.
- Abuses of power can be tied back to this existential frustration--someone who’s frustrated with their own life will often become numb to other people’s suffering, or, worse, want to cause others suffering to assuage their own.
- A study of alcoholics found that 90% suffered from a feeling of meaninglessness. Another studied drug addicts and found 100% of them agreed “things seem meaningless.”

You might be wondering how we got here--**what could cause a generation-wide existential vacuum?** Paradoxically, it could be the improvement of living conditions and freedom of choice.

- Early human ancestors had animal instincts - to survive, eat and drink, find shelter, and procreate. This innate behavior made a lot of automatic decisions, and there wasn’t much need (or ability) to think about a greater meaning.
- In early human history, as we developed intelligence and rational thinking, we broke ties with some of our most basic animal instincts. As society advanced, tradition took the place of biology as the driving factor behind our decisions.
    - For example, in many societies, it was tradition that men worked and women took care of the home--this tradition effectively decided what both men and women should do with their lives, preventing an aimless search for meaning.

But now, with modernization and greater freedom of choice, we’ve lost touch with a lot of old human traditions that guided our behavior. There is no more instinct or tradition telling us what to do. Now we have to decide for ourselves what to do, and often we don’t know what that is - which leads to a lack of meaning.

Logotherapy gives us a framework to help us resist nihilism: **if we assume life has meaning and our primary drive is to find that meaning, then it becomes about _how_ to find that meaning instead of questioning whether a meaning exists at all.** In Frankl’s opinion, logotherapy is a better way of dealing with nihilism than the more traditional and well-known psychotherapy.

- Psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud’s school of thought that asserted humans are driven by pleasure, is a reflective therapy: it suggests that our current behaviors are determined by our past experiences, and by reflecting on our pasts we can figure out what we’re seeking in the present.
    - Because it’s reflective, it wouldn’t be able to effectively deal with this nihilism--if we found experiences in our past that made us believe life was meaningless, reflecting on those experiences would only reinforce that idea, it wouldn’t work to change it.
    - Worse, psychotherapy would attribute the nihilism to external factors, or things outside ourselves--this would reinforce most patients’ nihilistic views, that we’re merely pawns of our biological, psychological, and social conditioning. It assumes a kind of determinism--that everything is already determined for us by external factors.

### Determinism

Determinism is the belief that humans aren’t free to make active choices because everything’s been determined for us by biology or other external factors. This idea is more dangerous when paired with nihilism, because it further reduces our power as individuals and makes it pointless to try to find a meaning to our lives.

**Logotherapy believes that humans are a self-determining species.** We are constantly deciding what our existence will be and what we’ll do next. And, as we saw in the first section, humans have shown time after time that they are capable of rising beyond their circumstances and conditioning to improve life and themselves for the better.

- Frankl’s experiences in the concentration camps reinforced that humans are free to make choices that help them survive even the worst of influences or conditions.

### The Passing of Time

Life is transitory, meaning it’s not permanent. **We’re all going to die someday, and this knowledge can increase our frustration with existence**, both because it can cause us to question the point of everything if we just die anyway, and because it can put the pressure of time on our search for meaning.

Life is also full of possibilities, and these are also transitory. They can’t all be permanent realities; we have to choose. This is another part of what makes it so hard to determine our meaning--there are so many options!

But just because life is transitory doesn’t make it meaningless--**because life is transitory, it actually reinforces our responsibility to find meaning in the moments of our lives.** Once we make a choice, we create a reality and do away with the other possibilities--so the choices we make are stored in the past. In this sense, our past choices are saved from the transitoriness of life. The choices we make will be immortalized in our past. Nothing can be undone or changed--we can only use the information to change our choices in the future.

Some might view this as pessimistic, the idea that we can’t change our past. But **logotherapy is activistic, or centered around actions, and future-oriented, not past-dwelling.**

- A pessimist might cross the days off her calendar with fear and sadness--time is passing, and she’ll die.
- An activist will mark the days and file it away with all the days before it, jotting notes down and reflecting on her past. Once she grows old, she won’t envy young people--who are full of possibilities and transitoriness--but **instead she’ll be proud of the _results in her past_**.
