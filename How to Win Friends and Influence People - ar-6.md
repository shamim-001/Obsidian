## Arguments 6: See Things from the Other Point of View

### Principles

- Always begin from this standpoint: **if you were born in the same body as your partner, had her experiences, and saw the world through the same lens, you would by definition arrive at the same conclusions.** Your challenge is thus to explore how this differs from you, not to reject her conclusion as invalid.
    - In the extreme, if you were born as Al Capone and had the same brain and experiences as Al Capone, you would also by definition do the same things as Al Capone.
    - (Shortform note: Avoid thinking, “no rational person could possibly think what my opponent is thinking.” This is the source of many irreconcilable arguments.)
- **There is a reason the other person thinks and acts as she does. Discover that reason, and you have the key to influencing this person**.
- Consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.
- Adopting this attitude is actually productive - it will help you discover your partner’s interests. This will then help you articulate your argument to appeal to their interests.

### Tactics

- Any upset person feels completely justified in their anger, no matter what you believe. It helps nothing to believe that they’re being illogical and to point this out.
- Before trying to change someone’s mind, pause and think through the whole situation: “why would he or she want to do it?” This will make you focus on their interests so you don’t fish with cheesecake.

### Examples

- A husband continuously criticized his wife for spending time gardening, saying the house looked no better than when they moved in years ago. Of course, they bickered. One day he saw things from her perspective, realizing that she enjoyed the work and was proud of it. He joined her in weeding, then complimented her on how things looked.
- Dale Carnegie was trying to advise teens not to burn down the forest: “Are you boys enjoying yourselves? What are you having for dinner? When I was a boy, I loved to build fires here myself. I know you guys don’t mean any harm, but other folks aren’t as careful. They see your fire, then they do it themselves, then they don’t put it out and it kills the trees. I don’t want to be bossy and ruin your fun. Could you rake the dry leaves away in case they catch an ember, and when you leave, cover the fire with a lot of dirt? This will make sure the forest is around for you to enjoy later. And if you see other boys doing this, pass it along.“
