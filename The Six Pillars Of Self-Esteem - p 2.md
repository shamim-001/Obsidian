# The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Pillar #2: Accept Yourself

Branden’s second pillar of self-esteem is to practice self-acceptance, or to accept yourself. In this section, you’ll learn what accepting yourself entails and why it’s important. Then, you’ll learn how to make accepting yourself easier.

### What Is Accepting Yourself?

Branden defines **accepting yourself as choosing not to live in conflict with yourself.** While an essential ingredient of self-esteem, it’s not the _same_ as self-esteem: Self-esteem is a state you experience; accepting yourself is an _action_ you take.

(Shortform note: Like Branden, Brach argues in _[Radical Acceptance](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance)_ that accepting yourself is critical to overcoming feelings of unworthiness. [You must recognize your desires and dislikes without judging yourself for them](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance#accepting-things-as-they-are) or feeling forced to act upon them.)

Branden posits that you accept yourself on three different levels.

**At the first level of accepting yourself, you’re on your own side.** On some fundamental level, you’re born believing that you’re valuable and deserve to exist simply because you’re alive, though some people lose this belief as they age. This primal belief propels us to ask for the help we need and demand the respect we deserve.

(Shortform note: Branden contends that you may lose the conviction that you’re valuable due to your behavior, but success coach Jen Sincero proposes an alternative reason: In _[You Are A Badass](https://shortform.com/app/book/you-are-a-badass/)_, she argues that we lose our love for ourselves as we age because [we absorb messages from those around us that make us stop trusting our instincts](https://shortform.com/app/book/you-are-a-badass/section-2#win-yourself-over-again) and fill us with self-doubt.)

**At the second level of accepting yourself, you’re willing to experience _all_ your emotions and behavior**—both good and bad. This doesn’t mean you approve of them, just that you don’t deny them. To accept your feelings, Branden explains, use both your body and mind. Breathe deeply to feel the emotion and then take ownership of it—instead of tensing or denying it.

Notably, _recognizing_ your reality isn’t the same as _accepting_ it. For example, you might admit you love someone inappropriate—then immediately move on because you’ve admitted your feelings. This isn’t accepting yourself. You’re not sitting with your reality; you’re avoiding it.

(Shortform note: Like Branden, Brach also stresses the importance of [understanding your experience without trying to change it](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-2#two-aspects-of-radical-acceptance) and of _always_ responding with care to whatever you’re experiencing, regardless of whether you’ve erred. Brach adds that if you _can’t_ respond with care—like you might when you recognize but don’t accept your reality—you likely [lack the tools to cope with what you’re experiencing](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-2#two-aspects-of-radical-acceptance), which leads you to judge or blame yourself.)

**At the third level of accepting yourself, you treat yourself with kindness.** To do this, Branden argues, you accept your poor behavior, then empathetically question _why_ you behaved poorly. (Shortform note: In _[Nonviolent Communication](https://shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication)_, psychologist Marshall Rosenberg asserts that [poor behavior stems primarily from unmet needs](https://shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication#step-3-connect-feelings-to-needs), so he suggests empathetically asking yourself questions like, “What unmet need prompted me to act that way?”)

Finally, Branden recommends, when you inevitably struggle to accept an emotion or behavior, **accept yourself by accepting your _unwillingness_ to accept it.** If you can’t accept that, accept your unwillingness to accept _that_ unacceptance. Keep going until you reach something you can accept.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Now](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/)_, spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle suggests an alternative mental exercise for dealing with things you struggle to accept: [Imagine that the irritant has entered your body, and work to break down the “wall” it’s bumping up against](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/solution-part-1#resisting-the-now-creates-pain) so that it can pass through you.)

### Why Accepting Yourself Matters

You now know what accepting yourself is—but why does it matter? Branden explains that you benefit from your general self-acceptance and from each individual level of accepting yourself.

In general, accepting your feelings can reveal a previously hidden emotion you can now deal with. For example, focusing on your indignation over not acing a test may reveal anxiety about your intelligence—and you can work on this anxiety. (Shortform note: If you don’t accept your feelings, [these hidden emotions will come out anyway](https://shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/chapter-5), the authors of _[Difficult Conversations](https://shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/)_ warn—and if you avoid them, they’ll color your communication, ruin your relationships, and make you feel worse about yourself.)

Looking at each aspect of this pillar, first, **being on your own side is the foundation on which you build self-esteem.** Without this baseline belief that your life is worth fighting for, you won’t make the behavioral changes necessary to effectively improve your self-esteem. (Shortform note: Although Branden doesn’t draw this connection, this may relate to the necessity of loving your life, as we discussed previously.)

Second, being willing to experience your actions and emotions matters because **you can only change what you accept.** Branden rejects the idea that accepting your reality implies resignation to it; rather, you find the motivation to change only when you accept the reality you dislike. For example, Branden notes that you’ll only act to improve your self-esteem if you _accept_ that you have low self-esteem. If you deny that you have low self-esteem, why would you try to change it?

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Now](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now)_, Tolle also emphasizes the importance of accepting your current reality, but he recommends [accepting the situation you’re in at a particular moment](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/solution-part-1#accepting-the-situation)—not an aspect of yourself, like your level of self-esteem.)

Third, **treating yourself with kindness** **makes you less likely to repeat your mistakes.** Compassionately reflecting on why you acted poorly allows you to address the root cause of that mistake. By doing this, you avoid damaging your self-esteem—so you don’t behave in negative ways that reflect damaged self-esteem in the future.

(Shortform note: Treating yourself with kindness may also benefit the people around you. For example, one psychologist notes that [new mothers who treat themselves with kindness when they make mistakes may encourage friends](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-balance-postpartum/202104/why-self-compassion-is-so-important-new-mothers) who give birth after they do to do the same.)

Fourth, Branden adds that **accepting your unwillingness to accept something naturally weakens that unwillingness.** Resistance requires something to fight against; if there’s nothing, it naturally fades. (Shortform note: One healer adds [that the key to acceptance is to understand why that resistance exists](https://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/1358/accepting-resistance.html). Knowing it’s there for a good reason may help you relax and make you more open to whatever you’re resisting.)

Finally, Branden warns that if you _don’t_ accept yourself, you risk not fulfilling your potential. Many of us resist our strengths because we fear the responsibility they come with. But unless you accept them, you can’t take full advantage of them.

(Shortform note: In contrast, some experts warn that [relying too heavily on your strengths may also prevent you from fulfilling your potential](https://qz.com/1004823/the-secret-to-a-happy-fulfilling-career-dont-play-too-much-to-your-strengths/). For example, one man’s penchant for planning may make him unable to delegate, which harms his work. So accept that the same quality can be both good and bad in different situations and work on specific aspects of it when necessary.)

### Exercises to Help You Accept Yourself

Branden recommends a five-week writing program to help you learn to accept yourself.

Follow the instructions listed below every weekday morning and evening. Then, each weekend, review your answers and write six to 10 answers to the following prompt: “If any of what I wrote this week is true, it might be helpful if I…”

#### Week 1

- **Mornings:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what accepting yourself means to you, what happens when you accept or reject your body, and what happens if you accept your conflicts.
- **Evenings:** Create and answer five sentence stems addressing what happens when you reject your conflicts, what happens when you accept or reject your feelings, and what happens when you accept or reject your thoughts.

#### Week 2

- **Mornings:** Create and answer three sentence stems addressing what happens when you accept or reject your actions, and what you are starting to notice.
- **Evenings:** Create and answer three sentence stems addressing what happens when you face the reality of your strengths and shortcomings, and what happens when you accept or reject your fears.

#### Week 3

- **Mornings:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what happens when you accept or reject your pain, and what happens when you accept or reject your anger.
- **Evening:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what happens when you accept or reject your sexuality, and what happens when you accept or reject your excitement.

#### Week 4

- **Mornings:** Create and answer three sentence stems addressing what happens when you accept or reject your joy, and what would happen if you were more willing to face your reality.
- **Evenings:** Create and answer two sentence stems addressing what would happen if you became more aware of your fears or pain.

#### Week 5

- **Mornings:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what would happen if you became more aware of your anger, your sexuality, your excitement, and your joy.
- **Evenings**: Create and answer three sentence stems addressing what happens when you don’t accept yourself, what would happen if you accepted things you didn’t want to admit, and what you’re starting to understand.

> **An Alternative Way to Accept Yourself: Build Shame Resilience**
> 
> Practicing “shame resilience” may also improve your ability to accept yourself. In _[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection)_, Brown explains that shame is a feeling that you don’t deserve love because you’re not good enough. [This feeling compels you to reject and hide parts of yourself that you think others will dislike](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/chapter-3#how-to-overcome-shame)—just as you do when you cannot accept yourself.
> 
> However, you can build resilience against this shame by [learning to identify shame as it occurs and move past it in a healthy way](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/chapter-3#how-to-overcome-shame). Brown implies that you can do so via a four-step process:
> 
> **Step 1: Learn how your shame manifests so that you can identify and address it**. You may experience physical sensations, like a dry mouth, or fall into thought patterns, like “I’m not good enough.”
> 
> **Step 2: Identify and evaluate the root cause of your shame.** Shame often comes from not meeting certain expectations, so questioning those can build shame resilience. Are they _really_ valid, or are they unrealistic?
> 
> **Step 3: Talk to someone trustworthy about your feelings of shame.** If you refuse to talk about your shame, it will fester and consume you. However, its influence over you will diminish if you get the shame out of your mind and into the world, where you and others can address it.
> 
> **Step 4: Avoid unhealthy reactions to shame**. Research has shown that [we frequently deal with shame in various unhealthy ways](http://trst.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shame-Humiliation-article-Stone-Institute.pdf), such as by distancing ourselves from or shaming others. None of these approaches to shame will help you to accept yourself.
