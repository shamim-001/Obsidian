## Prologue: The Beginning of the End

As a neurosurgical resident about to graduate and move into the role of doctor, I knew what the signs of cancer were. When I looked at the CT scan, at the lungs, the spinal cord, and the liver, the diagnosis became clear. I’d looked at similar scans over the years of my training, but those scans always belonged to others. They weren’t like this scan, which belonged to me.

My wife, Lucy, a doctor of internal medicine, and I had noticed the signs during the past 12 months, but neither of us vocalized our suspicions. I didn’t want to admit what the amount of weight I’d been losing or the immense back pain I had started experiencing added up to.

I’d had X-rays done because MRIs for the back were costly, and the results were normal. I knew that X-rays for cancer were more or less futile, but I still took the results and ran with them. Afterall, cancer at thirty-six was not common, especially cancer in the spine. I assumed it was a different type of spinal disorder because even if the odds of cancer were better, they still weren’t as good as other disorders. My training had taught me enough to know that. I accepted the explanation of aging and fatigue and went back to work.

Work was where I wanted to be. I’d spent ten years traveling a straight path from medical student to neurosurgical resident, and with graduation only a year and a half away, my rise to the more comfortable life of neurosurgeon and professor was almost realized. When that happened, my schedule would settle down. I could finally have a more stable life and a rested body and be the husband Lucy and I both wanted me to be.

But after another few weeks, the pain was not only in my back. I started experiencing significant chest pain. I was coughing relentlessly, and I dropped thirty pounds. I knew the odds were not in my favor.

I turned to the Internet, researching cancer in people aged mid- to late-thirties. Lucy discovered the search results and was livid. Her anger stemmed from my secrecy, from the fact that she had been managing her fears while I’d been managing mine. She was angry about what felt like a betrayal, not of my confidence, but of the drastic change in the picture of our life I was meant to create for us.

Her anger was so severe, she decided she needed time away from me, from our home, from our marriage. She didn’t feel we were balanced in our approach to our marriage. She felt like I wasn’t connected, wasn’t sharing my feelings with her, wasn’t taking her feelings seriously.

In truth, my training to be a neurosurgeon, one of the most taxing and challenging of the medical fields, had taken its toll on our relationship. Despite the fact that both of our futures were bright, I was a ghost in her life, coming and going from work while she slept, too exhausted after the day to make it to our bed.

We’d been scheduled to visit old friends in upstate New York, a trip Lucy was now going to skip. I said I would stay home, go to therapy, be more honest about my feelings, but none of it changed how she felt. She wanted space.

I agreed and accepted that the possibility of her leaving me was real and that our marriage might be over. I knew if that happened, I wouldn’t bother her with my yet-undetermined cancer diagnosis. I would let her go---let her find a happy life.

I didn’t cancel the trip. If I had cancer, it would likely be a long time before I could make the trip to see our friends. If things turned out for the better, than the trip could go on as planned.

I had a few tests done to eliminate the possibility of certain types of cancer, like testicular or leukemia, that occurred in young adults. All those tests were negative. But the pain in my back was intense. It had been growing steadily from minor discomfort to debilitating agony. When I reached Grand Central Station, where I would take the train north to my friend’s home, I could barely move.

I tried to lie down on a bench, but a security guard came swiftly over to admonish me. My brain immediately went to an excuse, the one that made the most sense, the one that said I was dying. I sat with that thought, but then another came, and this one reminded me that I had no proof of the worst. As a doctor, I obviously had a great grasp of back issues, had studied them, seen them, and heard what they felt like from patients. Maybe this was just what all those patients had been experiencing. Maybe I was just now able to understand it personally.

I wanted the vacation to bring my body peace. I wanted a few days of a regular pace of life---restful and calm---to alleviate the pain, but that didn’t happen. It became evident that the pain was not receding after the first couple of days.

Sitting around upstate, relaxing among my friends, I was reminded of a time when I worked at a summer camp and was reading a book on death surrounded by children running and screaming. At the time, I thought the dichotomy of their youthful exuberance amid my focus on the opposite was humorous. The current situation resembled the absurdity, except this time I was surrounded by my friends, healthy and living, while I sat removed in my bubble of death.

I called our host inside to tell him I was going home early. I told him the truth. He and I both heard the words that formed the likelihood of my impending cancer for the first time at the same time.

When I got home, I received a call from my doctor to inform me that the chest X-ray I’d had done before leaving seemed off. The lungs were murky, fuzzy. She said she couldn’t say definitively what the cause was, but that was likely not true. She knew, and so did I. And so did Lucy.

At that moment, everything we’d discussed regarding our marriage, all of the space that had been created between us, ceased to exist.

I went to the hospital and lay on the bed in a room I was all too familiar with. I had been a doctor in this room, served as a guide for patients diagnosed with incurable diseases, explained procedures, celebrated medical triumphs, witnessed the joys of patients who’d won their battles, watched others slip into the hands of death. I’d stared at this bed with envy when I felt almost too tired to move. Now I was in this bed, but sleep was the last thing on my mind.

Everything I’d worked for, the years, the toil, the training, the strain that was meant to equal the reward of my desired future, suddenly vanished.
