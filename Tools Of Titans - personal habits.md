# Tools of Titans

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Personal Habits

The people profiled in the book tend to be exceptionally disciplined and goal-oriented. Here are themes of advice on personal habits.

### Action, Not Information

Are you obsessed with learning new tactics, but have a problem following through? Realize that **success doesn’t come from knowledge, it comes from action**.

(Shortform note: This especially applies when reading nonfiction material like this book summary. Don’t just absorb the platitudes—think hard about what actionables you want to apply to your life.)

Here are quotes and stories around taking action:

- Author Derek Sivers: **“If [more] information was the answer, then we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs.”**
- Author and speaker Tony Robbins: An infographic doesn’t make you a master. What matters isn’t what you _know_—it’s what you _do_, consistently.
- Artist Chuck Close: Don’t feel you need to have that perfect idea before you start doing. Most likely you’re just holding yourself back. Only amateurs rely on inspiration—experts just get to work. While working, you’ll find new opportunities that wouldn’t be obvious if you just sat there thinking.
- Youtuber Casey Neistat: You can never count on being the most capable, most talented, most attractive person. But you can always compete by working hard.
- Entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant: Free information is everywhere on the Internet. What’s scarce is the desire to learn it.
- Filmmaker Rob Rodriguez: While in college, Rob started a comic strip. He’d try to get ideas by staring at the wall, but then found he was much more successful when he just started drawing and improving on it. If you wait for inspiration to hit, you’ll never act.
- Comedian and actor BJ Novak (_The Office_): Commit to future actions when you’re in a high energy state, so you can’t back out. He suggests first-time comics book their first week of shows well in advance, so they can’t back out after a bad performance.

Everyone starts somewhere. If you need a dose of courage, look at the earliest blogs of Tim Ferriss or Ramit Sethi, the earliest podcasts of the Joe Rogan show, or watch the pilot of hit TV shows. The titans you see today started out no better than their rough drafts, and you don’t have to do any better than that to get started.

#### Defeating Procrastination

Have a problem with procrastination? It might be caused by anxiety about the task. To combat this, Tim Ferriss forces himself to write down 3-5 things that are making him the most anxious. Then he asks himself,

- If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?
- Will doing this make all the other to-dos unimportant or easier to do later?

If so, he blocks out 2 to 3 hours to focus on one of them.

(Shortform note: For more on the idea that what is often most important is what scares you the most, [read our summary of Eat That Frog](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/eat-that-frog).)

#### Focus on the Process, Not the Goal

When you set ambitious goals for yourself, it’s frustrating to put in time but not make visible progress. Then it’s easy to lose motivation and stop doing the work. To get through rough patches, you need to simply do the work.

**If you commit to a long-term goal, then only one decision needs to be made and adhered to—put in the work.** This is easier than having to make lots of little decisions on what to do each day, which can be fatiguing and cause you to go astray.

US gymnastics coach Christopher Sommer: **“Show up, do the work, and go home.”**

### Start a Habit With a Tiny Push

Want to lose 50 pounds, or meditate for half an hour daily, or read a book a week forever? These are big goals—maybe too big. If you chew off too much at the start, you might falter and feel self-defeated.

Instead, **try just one small action**. No one ever has too little time or energy for one tiny action. Having one successful small action builds momentum to adopting your habit.

- Wordpress founder Matt Mullenweg: to get in shape, he committed himself to one push-up before bed.
- Former Google employee and author of _Search Inside Yourself_, Meng Tan suggests taking just one mindful breath a day.
- Music producer Rick Rubin: Artists who struggle to produce should just write a single word. Could they summon the energy to write just one word?

(Shortform note: The point of this tactic is that if you visualize a giant goal, the barrier to action is very high. If you falter, you’ll be disappointed with yourself, setting off a vicious cycle and cutting off your progress. Instead, distill your behavior change into the tiniest possible unit. Commit to doing just that one little thing. You’ll find it’s not as bad as you thought. For more on this idea, [read our summary of Atomic Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits).)

### Daily Routines

Several titans discussed their daily practices at the beginning and end of each day.

#### Morning Routines

Getting the start of your day right prepares you for success the rest of the day.

Tony Robbins changes his body physiology to prime himself into the right mental state. He starts with a cold-water plunge, then follows with [rapid breathing exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBjnograjq4) or a short walk. He then ends with a meditation on what he’s grateful for and what his goals for the day are.

Tim Ferriss has 5 morning rituals:

1. Make your bed.
    - Getting the day ready with a small task encourages you to do another. And no matter how bad your day goes, you can make your bed. This gives you some feeling of control. (Shortform note: [Read an expansion of this idea in our summary of the book Make Your Bed](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/make-your-bed).)
2. Meditate.
3. Do 5 to 10 reps of a physical exercise, like pushups or squats.
4. Make titanium tea, a combination of:
    - Pu-erh aged black tea
    - Dragon well green tea
    - Turmeric and ginger shavings
    - 1-2 tablespoons coconut oil
5. Write in his 5-minute journal
    - Answer the below questions with 3 answers each
    - I am grateful for…
    - What would make today great?
    - Daily affirmations. I am…

In her book _The Artist’s Way_, writer Julia Cameron notes that journaling daily acts like “spiritual windshield wipers”—once you get your confusing thoughts on paper, you can see the world through clearer eyes.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman finds the morning is when his mind is the freshest, and he spends 60 minutes working on the problem he set for himself the day before.

Navy SEAL and author Jocko Willink wakes up by 4:45 AM. While he was a warfighter, he felt this gave him a psychological advantage over his enemy—while his enemy was still sleeping, Jocko would be readying himself for their encounter.

#### End of Day Routines

Thomas Edison said, “Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.” Accordingly, Reid Hoffman gives his mind an overnight task, like a product design conundrum or a business strategy problem. He lets his subconscious mind get to work.

Like his start-of-day journal, Tim Ferriss has an end-of-day journal, where he answers two questions:

1. What are 3 amazing things that happened today?
2. How could I have made today better?

End the work day with high-quality work—don’t develop a bad habit of producing poor work at the end of the day. Ernest Hemingway ended his writing sessions mid-flow and mid-sentence so he could start with momentum the next day.

### Communication

Here are tips on how to communicate with other people.

**Tell people what you want, not what you don’t want.** Instead of “stop slouching,” say “stand up straight.”

**Practice going first.** People are ready for interaction, but you have to initiate. Make eye contact first, say hello first, smile first. You’ll be surprised by the response.

**Be vulnerable to get vulnerability.** Share some personal info about how you relate to a problem they have, or how you’re struggling with pressures. This will open up the conversation and help them reciprocate the pain.

- Brené Brown: Usually people think you gain trust first, then become vulnerable, but you can’t earn trust without being vulnerable first.

**Help people by just listening.** Sometimes, instead of giving advice, just be there and listen.

- Tim Ferriss gets a lot of questions, and he can’t respond to all of them. But when he does, he often does so publicly and makes clear he’s responding to listeners (such as replying to Tweets). For his listeners, often just feeling like he’s listening is enough.

### Improving On Your Weaknesses

Much of personal development is about identifying your weaknesses, then improving them with deliberate action.

#### Find Your Weak Spots

Finding your weak spots can be difficult—by its nature, if you’re not good at something, it’s often hard to _realize_ that you’re not good at it. The general theme of the advice is to get some distance from yourself and examine yourself more objectively.

First, **imagine you’re below average**. Derek Sivers reminds himself of this to compensate for [our tendency to think we’re above average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) in most things we do.

**Step outside yourself.** If someone else came to you with your exact problem, you’d likely be able to fix that problem. But when you have the problem yourself, it’s hard to see it and fix it.

- Think of yourself 10 years from now. What would that person tell you? (Shortform note: This might be a good way to visualize the best version of yourself, then highlight the differences between that ideal person and who you are today.)
- Imagine your best advisors in your head giving you advice. Goethe wrote a book by locking himself in a hotel room and imagining his 5 best friends on different chairs.
- Navy SEAL and author Jocko Willink often feels he’s not the person doing the action, but rather an observer of the person doing the action. This gives him objectivity and avoids seeing the world through his own emotional lens.

#### Deal With Your Weak Spots

Once you find your weak spots, get the motivation to fix them.

Often, people evade their weaknesses by making excuses: it wasn’t all that bad in the past, or it’ll get better in the future. To confront this, Tony Robbins developed the **Dickens Process**. Named after Ebenezer Scrooge from _A Christmas Carol_, it prompts you to visualize a bad future to motivate you to avoid it.

- Think about the limiting beliefs you have that are handicapping you.
- What has the belief cost you in the past? What has it cost other people you care about in the past? Visualize this and feel it viscerally. Hear the sounds, see the sights, feel the emotions.
- What is the belief costing you and people you care about, today, in the present? Hear the sounds, see the sights, feel the emotions.
- What will the belief cost you and people you care about in the future? Imagine what happens 1 year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now. Hear the sounds, see the sights, feel the emotions.

Going through this exercise forces you to confront the real costs of your bad behavior.

Then, you have only three options to address your weakness: improve on your weakness, eliminate work that relies on your weakness, or delegate that work to someone else who’s better at it than you.
