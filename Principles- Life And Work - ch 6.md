## Chapter 6: Extreme Honesty and Transparency

To Dalio, making the best decision doesn’t just require being open-minded to other people’s ideas. He believes that it also requires honesty and transparency. This works hand in hand with total receptivity—you can’t be truthful about issues, or hear truth about issues, when there’s the possibility of someone feeling defensive or hurt. At Bridgewater, this manifests in a culture of extreme honesty (what Dalio calls “radical truth”) and extreme transparency (what Dalio calls “radical transparency”).

### Extreme Honesty

Dalio says that **extreme honesty means not putting a filter on your thoughts**. Instead, you reveal them, question relentlessly, and surface issues immediately instead of hiding them.

Extreme honesty creates a powerful type of freedom. When you align what you feel and what you say, life gets simpler. You can focus on the most important things, and you’ll be happier.

(Shortform note: Studies show that [being authentic—behaving according to your true thoughts, personality, and values—leads to happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-doesnt-kill-us/201710/why-being-yourself-matters); in particular, it leads to higher levels of life satisfaction and lower levels of distress.)

When an entire organization operates with extreme honesty—bringing issues and weaknesses to the surface—team members can address disagreements when they first appear, rather than letting them fester under the surface. In contrast, Dalio claims, when a workplace operates on dishonesty, people tend to hide their real thoughts, and they bury problems and disagreements. This aggravates misunderstandings or disagreements and leads to larger conflicts and distance between team members.

(Shortform note: The pursuit of “radical truth” _can_ be detrimental to an organization, particularly when people get caught up in pursuing _inessential_ truths. A _[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html)_ article reports that [Bridgewater meetings can last for hours](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html) because employees argue about matters of little consequence, such as the meeting agenda.)

Bridgewater’s culture of extreme honesty means that **everyone has not only the privilege but also the _obligation_ to speak up publicly**. Dalio expects that when he does something foolish, other people will tell him so immediately. To him, doing otherwise would be unproductive and unethical. This practice works best in a place like Bridgewater where people actively set aside their egos—you can’t expect others to adhere to extreme honesty if you react emotionally every time they’re honest with you.

(Shortform note: Apple’s Steve Jobs had a similar approach, insisting that [people should be able to give fearless feedback](https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/steve-jobs-demanded-fearless-feedback-and-so-should-you.html). Apple even gave out [an award to those who stood up to Jobs](https://www.macworld.com/article/226727/what-joanna-hoffman-told-kate-winslet-while-shooting-the-steve-jobs-movie.html#:~:text=In%20reality%2C%20Joanna%20Hoffman%20won,other%20women%20in%20the%20company.&text=Coleman%20was%20the%20second%20woman,satirical%20op%2Ded%20in%20Macworld.).)

People at Bridgewater are also obligated to say what they want to say to people’s faces, instead of talking behind their backs. Dalio believes that gossip shows a lack of integrity and is considered the worst thing possible at Bridgewater.

(Shortform note: While gossip is viewed negatively at Bridgewater, some [research suggests that it has some positive effects](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/the-surprising-benefits-of-gossiping-at-work-according-to-new-psychology-research.html): People who hear gossip about themselves can use the information for self-reflection and improvement. Additionally, _harmless_ gossip—the neutral, nonjudgmental sharing of information about others—can also help teams form stronger connections.)

#### Short-Term Painful, Long-Term Helpful

Often the cost of extreme honesty is the discomfort that follows open criticism. But Dalio says telling people what they need to improve, though uncomfortable, should be seen as a sign of care and respect. If you’re clear that your purpose is to arrive at the truth and not to prove anyone wrong, there won’t be any misunderstandings about your intent.

In essence, extreme honesty is an organizational reflection of Dalio’s formula, “Pain + Reflection = Progress.” People who can internalize this formula on an individual level can operate similarly on the organizational level.

(Shortform note: A key to applying Dalio’s formula meaningfully is [taking care not to turn reflection into rumination](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-introverts-corner/201302/introspection-versus-rumination), which means dwelling on negative, self-flagellating thoughts. Instead, [use your reflection time to yield greater insight](https://ideas.ted.com/the-right-way-to-be-introspective-yes-theres-a-wrong-way/) and self-awareness by replacing “why” questions (“Why did this happen?”) with “what” questions (“What’s going on?” What’s another way of looking at this?”). Asking “why” is past-oriented and makes you focus on your limitations, while asking “what” is future-oriented and makes you see your potential.)

### Extreme Transparency

**Extreme transparency lets everyone see everything.** Dalio says that everyone in an organization should get access to the full truthful information, rather than having it filtered through other people first. In turn, people with more complete information can make better decisions, and the organization draws on the full power of its people.

At Bridgewater, extreme transparency means all meetings and interviews are recorded and made available to the entire team, personality profiles show each person’s strengths and weaknesses, and an app allows everyone to rate each other in real time.

> **A Different Approach to Extreme Honesty and Transparency**
> 
> Extreme honesty and transparency can build trust within a team, help people grow, and increase efficiency. Dalio’s version of it seeks to remove emotions from the equation, but the book _[Radical Candor](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor)_ has a different approach. Author Kim Scott writes that the [two crucial components](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor) of radical candor are:
> 
> - **Caring personally**—this means seeing employees as people and not just as workers. Keep in mind that work isn’t “just business,” and recognize that employees have a life outside of work that may be affecting their job performance.
>     
> - **Challenging directly**—this means giving criticism _in private_ to help improve performance. Scott writes that public criticism (which is the norm at Bridgewater) triggers defensiveness and anxiety within a team.

#### Benefits of Extreme Transparency

Dalio says that extreme transparency is good for the workplace because:

- It reduces politics and keeps people from having to manage others’ impressions of them, since everything’s out in the open. (Shortform note: [Netflix](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules) has a similar policy of organizational openness. For example, they [tell employees when there’s a possibility that they’ll lose their jobs](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-5). Though it’s a risky move because it can distract employees and make them anxious, CEO Reed Hastings believes it’s better than telling people that they’ve lost their jobs without notice.)
- It reduces bad behavior, since it can be monitored. At first, Bridgewater lawyers thought recording everything would be a liability in lawsuits and regulatory action. In reality, extreme transparency _limited_ bad behavior, since people knew they were being watched. Justice is also more likely to prevail because decisions aren’t made behind closed doors, so people can defend themselves when they’re accused of things they didn’t do. (Shortform note: While Netflix doesn’t record all meetings, Hastings does [conduct most meetings out in the open](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-5).)
- Learning is amplified by other people’s experiences. For example, recorded meetings provide training scenarios, where new employees can simulate their responses to real situations. (Shortform note: As Dalio says, Pain + Reflection = Progress. At Netflix, [people are encouraged to own up to their mistakes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-5) because this not only serves as a teaching tool but also encourages people to take risks and builds trust.)

#### Exceptions to Extreme Transparency

Dalio suggests that **you should be extremely transparent in organizations as a default, with very few exceptions**. Often the most difficult information to share is the most important to share, because it builds the trust of people you are sharing it with. Bridgewater only has a few exceptions to its transparency rule:

- When information is private or personal and doesn’t pertain to the community (such as personal health issues)
- When information puts the long-term interests of Bridgewater or its clients at risk (such as trading details that competitors can use, intellectual property, or audits of departments)
- When the value of sharing is low but the risk of distraction is high (such as compensation, or information that will be distorted by the media)

(Shortform note: [Some opine that these exceptions highlight the firm’s hypocrisy](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-10-13/the-case-against-bridgewater-isn-t-proven), as they champion extreme transparency only when it’s in their own best interest. While Dalio says that information that is personal, is low-value, or puts Bridgewater or its clients at risk are exceptions to transparency, Bridgwater has somewhat murky disclosures in government filings on assets, fees, and ownership. In a complaint against Bridgewater over gender discrimination and contract disputes, former co-CEO Eileen Murray also alleged that [the firm sought to punish those who shared facts](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mt6glb91wffx/Brazen-Hypocrisy-Eileen-Murray-s-Lawsuit-Against-Bridgewater-Heats-Up) to the public.)

### Caveats to Extreme Honesty and Transparency

Extreme honesty and transparency have a number of benefits and lead to better decision-making, but they aren’t easy to execute. Dalio cautions against two issues in organizations:

#### 1) Dishonesty Will Happen

Dalio warns that people will continue to lie, and there will be dishonest people no matter what you try to do. You shouldn’t be naive about this. When liars are caught, they’ll say they’ll never do it again, but they most likely will.

Yet Dalio doesn’t see firing people over dishonesty as an absolute rule, since firing everyone who has ever lied would mean he’d have no one to work with. Instead, he says you should treat each case of dishonesty independently, and decide what to do based on the severity of the transgression and the prior history. Get rid of habitual liars. Then deter future bad behavior with “public hangings” where violators are made examples of.

> **Helping Employees Forward From a “Public Hanging”**
> 
> Being publicly berated for their mistakes can have a negative impact on employees and make them feel more anxious at work, but it can become a positive learning experience if they know how to respond. Aside from reminding people about total receptivity and the importance of learning from their mistakes, you can help them move forward by [adopting the following strategies](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed) from _[So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed)_:
> 
> - **Write a new narrative.** Help them realize that they are more than their mistake.
>     
> - **Manage shame.** Help them find ways to reframe the situation to take the humiliation away. Author Jon Ronson cites the example of a porn star who manages the shame associated with her industry by seeing the scenes she acts in as “awesome.” While employees might not see a “public hanging” as awesome, they can learn to see it as a turning point for improved performance and greater success.
>     

#### 2) Adjustment Time Is Needed

Dalio acknowledges that extreme honesty and transparency are very different from how most places operate, so most people will need an adjustment period after they adopt the principles. (For reference, Bridgewater finds that new employees can take 18 months to adjust fully, and many people never adjust at all and leave.)

> **Help New Hires Adjust**
> 
> New hires at any organization may struggle at first because they aren’t yet familiar with the inner workings of the company, whether it’s one as unique as Bridgewater or not. Help [ease the adjustment period](https://hbr.org/2019/05/7-ways-to-set-up-a-new-hire-for-success) by reassuring them that their first priority is to learn the ropes, not to actually be productive. To support them, focus on three areas of learning:
> 
> - **Technical**—the products, systems, and technology they’ll be using
>     
> - **Cultural**—the attitudes and values of the organization
>     
> - **Political**—the decision-making process and people involved
>     
> 
> Regularly check in with them to see their progress rather than leaving them to fend for themselves, then step in to support them when necessary.
