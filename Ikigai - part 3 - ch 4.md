## Part 3: Living Your Ikigai | Chapter 4: Staying Young and Living Long

You’ve now learned what ikigai is, how to find your own ikigai, and how to build it into your life through flow. **The next thing to do is to start building healthful practices into all areas of your life (the “positive habits” that Ogimi’s residents talked about)** to support your pursuit of your ikigai and give you a long life for doing it.

In this chapter, you’ll learn several principles, both ancient and modern, about aging and how to slow it down. These principles all relate to the subject of ikigai through their emphasis on optimizing your mind-body connection to maintain your youthfulness. Fulfilling your ikigai goes hand in hand with having a long life full of health and vitality.

### The Mind-Body Connection

**To begin with, understand the important role that your mind plays in the aging process.** Many studies have shown that keeping a strong and healthy mind, one that’s active and adaptable, is directly connected to staying young. To maintain a healthy mind:

- Learn how to mitigate the effects of stress through serenity
- Practice keeping your mind busy

#### Using Serenity to Counter Stress

The first way to keep your mind strong is to learn how to remain calm and positive when you’re confronted with stress. Such an attitude can actually preserve your youth, as science has found that stress makes your cells age faster and contributes to health troubles such as insomnia and high blood pressure.

One way to automatically generate serenity and counteract stress is to know and follow your ikigai by practicing it in flow. You’ll learn more in Chapter 5 about preserving your serenity in the midst of challenges.

#### Revitalizing Your Mind

It’s also important to avoid mental laziness. **Mental exercise is just as important for health and youthfulness as physical exercise because it revitalizes your brain.** One easy but effective way to give your brain a workout and help it stay young is to open yourself to change. For example:

- Step outside your comfort zone.
- Learn new information or a new skill.
- Play a game with other people.

When you take in new information, your brain creates new neural connections to process it. In this way, processing new information actually grows and shapes your brain in new ways, keeping it pliable and young.

### Overcoming the Sedentary Life

Along with attending to your mind-body connection, the other main thing you should do to ward off aging and stay healthy is **avoid too much sitting and inactivity.** The hyper-sedentary lifestyle of most modern technological societies contributes to a variety of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, immune system troubles, a drop in “good cholesterol levels” (after just five minutes of sitting), and even cancer.

#### Moving Your Body

As you’ve learned, exercise is one of the longevity factors for people in Blue Zones. It’s not that these people go to the gym all the time. They just stay active and move their bodies. In Ogimi, people walk, dance, do karaoke, play gateball, and tend their gardens. **You can easily employ this principle yourself through such simple choices as walking to work, taking the stairs, or joining a sports team.**

For a more formal approach to getting more exercise, consider practicing one of the following Eastern mind-body disciplines. Not all of them are from Japan, but all can offer you simple techniques to preserve your youth and health through gentle movements. Note that these disciplines all invoke the important mind-body connection by combining gentle physical exercise with an awareness of your breathing. Aligning your breathing with your movement helps you to remain centered instead of being swept away by your thoughts and worries.

##### Radio Taiso

Radio taiso dates back to before World War II. It gets its name from the fact that instructions for doing it used to be broadcast through radio. Today, most people follow radio taiso instructions on television or through the Internet. In Ogimi, nearly everybody does radio taiso, even nursing home residents. A workout takes only five or 10 minutes, and the movements are designed to exercise a maximum number of joints. The most basic exercise is to raise your arms over your head from the side in a circular motion and then bring them down.

##### Yoga

Yoga originated in India as a way to unite and purify the mind and body while bringing people closer to both their personal nature and the divine. The most widely practiced form of yoga in the West (and also in Japan) is the body-focused style called hatha yoga. It consists of practicing different asanas—physical poses or postures—to balance your energies.

##### Tai Chi

Originally intended as a discipline for personal growth, self-defense, and mind-body healing, tai chi has now become widely known as a general method of exercise, largely due to the Chinese government’s promotion of it for that purpose. The best-known among many different tai chi styles are Chen, Yang, Wu, and Hao. The one most people are familiar with today is Yang-style, which has long, fluid movements. All tai chi styles have the same goals:

- Use stillness to control movement.
- Use finesse to overcome force.
- Arrive first, move second.
- Know both your opponent and yourself.

##### Qigong

The word _qigong_ translates roughly as “working with the life force” or “cultivating life energy.” It’s a Chinese art, loosely related to tai chi, that seeks to strengthen a person’s _qi_ or _chi_ (inner energy) through movement, breathing, and meditation. In keeping with the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine and philosophy, qigong holds that your life energy flows through your whole body and consists of five different currents corresponding to the body, breath, mind, life force, and spirit. Qigong’s most widely known exercise seeks to balance these currents, and the discipline as a whole teaches that by learning to regulate these currents, you can unify your entire being.

Studies have shown that qigong is associated with many health benefits, including improved heart health, better circulation, reduced side effects from cancer treatments, better blood flow to the brain, better mind-body connection, lower blood pressure, better balance among the sex hormones, and more.

**_Getting Enough Sleep_**

Having considered these exercises, it’s worth mentioning that **the warning against being too sedentary doesn’t extend to avoiding sleep, which provides important anti-aging benefits.** The modern world suffers from a positive plague of sleep deprivation, and this is causing us to age prematurely and suffer from a variety of health problems. Sleep is a major anti-aging tool because it generates melatonin, a powerful antioxidant that strengthens your immune system, smooths your skin, and has other benefits. Combining adequate sleep with gentle exercise is a major way to preserve your health and youth.

### Eating Well

To support the pursuit of your ikigai through healthy living, establishing a healthy mind-body relationship through inner calm and gentle movement is necessary, but not sufficient. **You also have to eat well.**

#### The Okinawan Diet

A variety of research has uncovered the principles of Okinawan eating for promoting health and longevity. Understanding these principles is important to anybody who’s interested in fulfilling their ikigai, because the Okinawans’ dietary principles, like every other aspect of their lives, are linked both to their pursuit of ikigai and to their longevity.

##### Eat Little Food

**Compared to other people, even to other Japanese, Okinawans eat very little overall.** The average Japanese caloric intake is about 2,068 calories per day. Okinawans consume only 1,785. Not insignificantly, people in all five of the world’s Blue Zones likewise consume fewer calories than people in other parts of the world. Moreover, modern medical science has verified the health benefits of eating less. Calorie restriction frees up energy that would otherwise go into digestion. It reduces the amount of insulin-like growth factor 1, which plays an important role in aging/ It protects against negative health conditions such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The key to practicing calorie restriction effectively is to eat only foods with a high nutritional value while avoiding empty junk food.

**One easy way to practice calorie restriction is to employ Japan’s “80 percent rule,” or _hara hachi bu_. This rule says you should stop eating when you feel 80 percent full.** There are various ways to use this rule in your own eating. For instance, reduce your portion sizes or skip dessert. You can also get the same effects of the 80 percent rule by practicing intermittent fasting. Pick two days a week to eat nothing. Alternatively, use the 5:2 diet, in which you eat regularly on five days of the week and limit yourself to fewer than 500 calories on the other two days.

##### Eat a Varied Diet

**While Okinawans may eat very little, the food they do eat is highly varied.** Their diet includes an average of 18 different foods per day and 206 different foods in all. They use the metaphor of a rainbow to determine whether they’ve achieved the desired variety: Is there a multiplicity of colors on the plate?

Okinawans base their diet on grains, eating rice as their primary food, sometimes adding noodles. They also eat at least five servings of vegetables and fruits—and at least seven different types—every day. In fact, they fill more than 30 percent of their diet with vegetables, of which legumes, soy, potatoes, and vegetables are staples.

Okinawans eat sugar only rarely (one-third the amount consumed in the rest of Japan). When they do, it’s cane sugar, which has anticarcinogenic benefits. They also eat very little salt—only 7 grams per day, far below the Japanese average of 12 (which is already low compared to other countries). Okinawa is the only Japanese province that succeeds in following the government-recommended limit of less than 10 grams of salt per day.

#### The Antioxidant Connection

You’ve already learned about the health benefits of sleep, which involve your body’s production of melatonin, a powerful antioxidant. **The Okinawan diet amplifies this effect by including many antioxidant-rich foods.** Antioxidants slow down the oxidation process in your cells by fighting free radicals, molecules that cause cellular oxidation and may contribute to cancer.

Okinawans eat 14 high-antioxidant foods almost every day:

- Tofu
- Miso
- Tuna
- Carrots
- Goya (bitter melon)
- Sea kelp
- Cabbage
- Seaweed
- Soy sprouts
- Hechima (a gourd-like cucumber)
- Soybeans
- Sweet potatoes
- Peppers

For Westerners who may not be able to get their hands on these Japanese foods, there are many other antioxidant foods readily available. These include:

- Broccoli and chard
- Oily fish such as salmon and sardines
- Various fruits, including citrus fruits and strawberries
- Various berries, especially blueberries and goji berries
- Dried fruit
- Various grains, including oats and wheat
- Olive oil
- Red wine

##### A Bit About Beverages

**Okinawans also drink a huge amount of antioxidant-rich tea, including sanpin-cha, a mixture of jasmine flowers with green tea.** This tea relieves stress, lowers cholesterol, strengthens the immune system, and reduces heart attack risk. If you can’t get your hands on sanpin-cha, you can still get some of the same benefits by drinking jasmine tea or green tea of very high quality. Scientific studies have confirmed the age-old belief in green tea’s healthful effects, linking it to bone health, improved circulation, lowered blood sugar levels, lowered cholesterol, and protection of skin from UV damage.

White tea is also a valuable source of antioxidants. In fact, it has the highest antioxidant effect of any natural food, making it potentially even more powerful than green tea.

Another antioxidant-rich Japanese beverage is shikuwasa, made in the city of Ogimi from the citrus fruit of the same name and drunk diluted with water. All citrus fruits contain nobiletin, which is rich in antioxidants, and shikuwasa is particularly nobiletin-rich: It contains 40 times more nobiletin than oranges.
