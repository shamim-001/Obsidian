## Chapter 3: Finding Antifragility

A basic guideline is that anything living—whether literally, as with organisms, or figuratively, as with an artist’s growing and changing popularity—will have some degree of antifragility. Inanimate objects like glasses, cars, and the like, will be durable at best; they might be able to stand up to some amount of stress, but they can never be strengthened by it. **Living things can grow stronger after being damaged.**

It’s true that, in spite of their ability to repair and strengthen themselves, organisms will eventually age and deteriorate. However, it’s possible that what we observe as “aging,” particularly in humans, is a combination of natural senescence and an environment without enough stressors to keep people strong.

(Shortform note: In biology, senescence means the loss of a cell’s ability to divide and replicate itself. More generally, it means the natural degeneration of an organism that comes with age.)

Senescence might be unavoidable, but many of the problems aging people experience come from being poorly adjusted to a too-comfortable environment. As people age, in many cases, caregivers (whether professionals or family members) see to more and more of their needs. The elderly then suffer the effects of too much comfort—with nothing to keep themselves physically or mentally strong, they decline. In short, too much caregiving stifles their antifragility.

**“Modern” societies are focused on making life last longer and longer, even as the people living those lives get sicker and sicker.** However, in “primitive” hunter-gatherer societies, the effects of old age didn’t take hold until very near to the end of life.

### Simple vs. Complex Systems

Instead of thinking about living versus nonliving things, perhaps a better way to think about antifragility is in terms of simple versus complex systems. A light switch is a simple system: You flip the switch and the light turns on. If part of the system is damaged—there’s a faulty wire or a burned-out bulb—the system works less effectively or not at all.

A human body and a civil rights movement are complex systems: They have many parts that depend on and communicate with each other. For example, the various parts of your body don’t receive information from logical observations and thoughts, but from chemical stressors in the form of hormones. In a civil rights movement, of course, the various people in it will communicate with each other with all the usual methods that people use.

Political and economic systems are similarly complex, made up of many parts interacting with one another. To Adam Smith, the economy was a clock, a complex mechanism that could be wound up and left to run on its own. Plato, on the other hand, talked about the now-famous ship of state, likening a country to a ship that needs constant tending and a competent captain.

Regardless of who—if anyone—is in charge of the system, communication and interdependency are two of the keys to antifragility. When part of a system is able to communicate that it’s been damaged, and other parts of that system are able to compensate for that damage—or overcompensate, as discussed earlier—antifragility is the result.

### The Dangers of Removing Stress and Randomness

**Modern life, in many ways, tries to remove the stress and randomness from life.** We schedule our every move: when we work, when we eat, when we sleep, not to mention _how_ we do all of those things. Even our entertainment is scripted and scheduled, like going to the bar after work and to movies on the weekends.

This process could be called _touristification_: Tourism is like adventure with all of the risk and unpredictability removed, and modern society tries to make us tourists in our own lives. Someone who doesn’t take well to the touristification, who finds herself unhappy or unable to focus, will probably seek out medication to help herself fit in.

The side effect of this lack of struggle is a lack of personal growth, of artistic expression and in many cases, of valuable lessons. For example, one learns a language best by being immersed in it, by making mistake after mistake before learning how to communicate effectively. However, to avoid that embarrassment and struggle, we teach languages in classrooms using books and rules, and we get much worse results.

**As complex living things, humans benefit from—and secretly hunger for—some amount of risk and chance.** Someone who can’t find the energy to go to a preplanned gym session could lift a car off of a trapped child, if need be. Someone who can’t stick to a diet will skip meals quite easily if there’s simply no food to be had.

A _chronic stress injury_ happens when someone repeats the exact same movement too many times in a row, like walking on a randomness-free treadmill. A great deal of modern life consists of chronic stress injuries, both literal and metaphorical—such as long-term dissatisfaction with one’s job.

In short, people will rise to naturally occurring challenges and grow stronger from them; conversely, they become weak and unfocused when the environment doesn’t provide such challenges.
