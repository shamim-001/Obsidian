## Law #1: People Are Self-Absorbed

**Because attention is a fundamental human need, we’re all at least a little bit self-absorbed and narcissistic,** whether that’s an obsession with our self-image or an obsession with collecting external attention. Also, we become more self-absorbed as we age because we realize we’re the only ones interested in our own well-being.

We’ll use this law to manage toxic types and make ourselves more empathetic.

### Manage Toxic Types: Narcissists

There are three different categories of narcissists:

#### Category #1: Deep Narcissists

**Deep narcissists lack a self-image, so the only way they can meet their need for attention is by getting it from others.**

As children, **some extroverted deep narcissists do perfectly well. They learn how to attract attention,** and people often think they’re vivacious and social. **Introverts, on the other hand, inaccurately create a fantasy self-image** that’s far superior to themselves and any real people. This image is unrealistic, so no one, including themselves, will validate it, and they’re constantly editing it to try to come up with something that sticks.

**Both extroverted and introverted deep narcissists struggle once they’re in their twenties and thirties.** People get tired of extroverts’ dramatic bids for attention, and extroverts have to find new social circles regularly. Introverts further isolate themselves because they’re both socially awkward and sure they’re better than everyone else, and no one wants to spend time with that kind of person. Sometimes, deep narcissists become addicted to alcohol or drugs.

To identify deep narcissists, look for the following flags:

- When challenged or insulted, they get righteously angry or act victimized (they have no internal mechanism to deal with these feelings).
- They take everything personally.
- They think they have a lot of enemies.
- They want to control others, see them as self-objects (part of themselves), and think the only point of others is to give them attention.
    - For example, in a romantic relationship, they force their partners to end all their other relationships so they get all their attention.
- They make others feel guilty for not paying them enough attention.
- They get impatient or bored when you talk to them about something that doesn’t affect them, and they try to bring the conversation back to themselves.
- They’re envious when others get attention.
- They’re very self-confident because this serves two purposes: gaining attention and hiding insecurities. However, this self-confidence is usually unjustified—they aren’t actually as competent as they appear to be.
- Often, they struggle with their jobs because they’re so worried about what others think of them that it’s hard to concentrate on anything outside themselves. (There is one exception—those who use their professional accomplishments to garner attention.)

##### Subcategories of Deep Narcissists

There are four types of deep narcissists. If no more specific directions are given on how to handle each type, you should avoid them.

**Type #1: Leaders**

**These deep narcissists are more driven than most and put this energy towards their work.** People are drawn to them because their self-confidence makes them seem competent, and some of their surprising behaviors that don’t meet social conventions seem authentic and honest. They can be dangerous in romantic relationships and particularly in leadership positions, because the more people who follow them, the more important they feel.

- For example, most dictators are narcissistic leaders.

They tend to be bad leaders. If challenged, they rage. They create problems only they can solve to demonstrate that they’re powerful and gain them more attention. **Whatever organization or group they lead usually struggles because they need to control everyone.**

To deal with these types, avoid joining their groups.

**Type #2: Controllers**

**These narcissists are more ambitious, energetic, and insecure than other deep narcissists.** They’re so sensitive to what others think of them that they’re constantly paying attention to others’ feelings and thoughts. **At some point, these narcissists realize that their powers of observation can be used to learn about other people’s self-images.** This allows these narcissists to mimic empathy, be likable, appear self-confident, and manipulate people. They’re most dangerous when they’re being charming.

- For example, when Joseph Stalin first became premier of the Soviet Union, he was charming, funny, representative of an average person, and he made everyone he met feel important.

These narcissists’ interactions aren’t completely faked. Otherwise, they would never draw anyone in. However, once the interaction is over, they ax any positive feelings—if they didn’t, they’d be vulnerable. The next time they encounter the same people, they act cold, which confuses people and makes them want to feel the camaraderie again.

**Once they have power, they get resentful that they ever had to give other people attention.** They’ll turn away from friends and create rock-and-a-hard-place situations.

- For example, Stalin was angry with his lieutenants both when they agreed with him—they were useless and he had to do all the work himself—and when they disagreed—how dare they question him.

To identify this type of narcissist:

- **Scrutinize their empathy.** While they may appear likable, they don’t truly pay attention to you and they always pull back.
- **Study their past.** They often have troubled childhoods and have never had an intimate relationship. If people from their past try to warn you about them, pay attention.
- **Look at their staff.** If anyone who serves them looks scared, this is a red flag.

It’s hard to avoid these narcissists because they’re so ambitious they often end up in positions of power, but once you’ve identified them, stay away. It’s the only way to be safe.

**Type #3: Theatrical**

**These narcissists hide the fact that they crave attention because they know it would make them unlikeable.** They disguise their narcissism by playing roles and inciting drama, and they often go to extreme lengths to seem moral or victimized.

The only way to deal with this type of narcissist is to avoid being drawn in by the show. If someone is always more victimized or more moral than anyone else, be suspicious, and look for drama in their past.

For example, French nun Jeanne de Belciel was a theatrical narcissist. When she was young, her need for attention so annoyed her parents that they sent her to a convent in Poitiers. There, she was sarcastic and superior, which got her sent off to another convent, this time in Loudun. Since her previous two acts hadn’t worked, in Loudun, she decided to become an expert in piousness. This approach did work—when the prioress left, Jeanne succeeded her. **Being in charge wasn’t enough, however, so she dramatically pretended to be possessed, which resulted in public exorcisms, the execution of her supposed sorcerer, self-mutilation, and once she was cured, a tour of Europe to show off how blessed she was.**

**Type #4: Partner-Enhanced**

Narcissism isn’t limited to a single person; it can appear in a relationship as well. **Partners who don’t understand each other’s values and aren’t willing to learn empathy can encourage narcissistic tendencies in the other person.**

To avoid this situation, employ empathy by learning more about the other person. **When you treat someone with empathy, they can’t be defensive because you’re coming at things from their point of view.** When one person is empathetic, this encourages the other person to be empathetic as well. (Being defensive is a lot of work and most people don’t want to do it.)

For example, Leo Tolstoy and Sonya Behrs were a narcissistic couple. Leo was a deep narcissist and Sonya was fairly self-absorbed as well. Their trouble started just before their marriage when Leo asked Sonya to read his diaries. He asked her to do this because he didn’t want there to be any secrets in their relationship. She, on the other hand, thought he’d asked her to read them because he didn’t want to marry her—the diaries were full of descriptions of his affairs, encounters at brothels, STIs, and other vices. Her reaction made Leo think she didn’t love _him_.

They did marry, but there was more conflict, often caused by one of them not understanding the other’s motivations. Leo would do something that annoyed Sonya, she’d do something extreme in response, and he’d feel bad and repent. Then, she’d do something that made him regret his repentance. They were never happy together. Leo eventually ran away, Sonya attempted suicide unsuccessfully and then chased him, and Leo fell ill while fleeing and died.

#### Category #2: Functional Narcissists

**Most of us are functional narcissists—self-absorbed, but able to operate because we get enough attention from our self-image that we have time and energy to focus on things outside of ourselves.** Functional narcissists have moments of deeper narcissism when something goes wrong in their lives, but they can usually recover.

#### Category #3: Healthy Narcissists

**Healthy narcissists have a strong self-image and they don’t need as much attention from others.** They’ve accepted that they’re flawed, which makes their self-image even stronger because it’s close to reality. As a result, **they can handle criticism, and they can focus outside of themselves more easily so they tend to be professionally or artistically successful.** This success creates validation, which further strengthens their sense of self.

### Be More Empathetic: Become a Healthy Narcissist

We should all strive to be category #3 narcissists—healthy. **Healthy narcissists achieve their strong self-image and outward focus by mastering empathy, which is concentrating on others instead of themselves.** Everyone has the potential to be empathetic because reading other people and thinking like them used to be critical to our survival. If we couldn’t communicate or cooperate, we would die.

In modern life, however, we don’t need this kind of empathy to survive—we don’t die if we misread someone’s mood. As a result, people are less empathetic than they used to be. Studies have shown that since the 1970s and especially since 2000, young people are more narcissistic. There are two other factors that likely play a role in increasing narcissism:

- **Advances in technology.** Like any skill, practicing empathy requires focus, and phones regularly interrupt in-person interactions.
- **Increasing value on individualism.** Individualism—focusing on ourselves, our rights, and our opinions—by nature requires self-involvement.

Because social interaction is a fundamental need, this increased self-absorption is bad for our brains. It’s bad for society too—it makes people resistant to or disbelieving of the opinions of others.

To develop the latent empathy that resides within us all, develop four empathetic skills:

#### Skill #1: Attitude

Most people assume that they understand others and quickly judge them, but to develop your empathetic attitude, you must let go of this assumption. **Assume you’re ignorant, you have biases, and people don’t have the same values as you.**

Additionally, become aware of the **attribution bias, which states that when you make a mistake, you chalk it up to circumstances, but when others make a mistake, you think it was because they’re flawed.** Instead, when someone makes a mistake, consider their circumstances, the same as if you were evaluating your own mistake.

Finally, accept yourself and your flaws. If your self-image is inaccurately superior or insecure, you’ll have a hard time being empathetic with anyone.

To practice this skill, in your everyday conversations, listen to others instead of talking. Listen well enough that later in the conversation, you can refer back to things the other person has said or implied.

#### Skill #2: Mirroring

When someone near us is feeling or showing an emotion (for example, showing disappointment by frowning), we tend to pick up the emotion and feel it too. This is because when we watch someone do something, mirror neurons fire in our brains as if we were also doing the same thing ourselves. This firing generates the corresponding emotion.

**The goal of mirroring is to translate our physical mimicking of others into an understanding of what they’re feeling and what they want.** What people say aloud isn’t necessarily true, so instead pay attention to how they make you feel—intentions are driven by emotion, so if you can understand their emotions, you can figure out what they want.

To learn this skill, you can do one or both of the following techniques:

**1. Consciously mimic people’s facial expressions and body language** to encourage your brain to fire the corresponding emotion so you can feel it and figure out what it is. (However, do this subtly, otherwise, you risk appearing creepy.)

- For example, if someone smiles, smile back.

**2. Recall an experience you had that created the same emotion** you think someone else is feeling.

- For example, when writer Alex Haley was researching his book _Roots_, which takes place partly belowdecks on a ship, he visited ships. Then, when he sat down to write, he could recall what being belowdecks felt like and empathize with his characters

Mirroring people will also encourage them to empathize with _you_. When two people are connecting, they both mimic each other, which is called the chameleon effect.

Caution! Don’t let yourself fall too deeply into another’s emotions or else you’ll lose the objectivity you need for analysis and risk losing control.

#### Skill #3: Analysis

**Analytic empathy is understanding someone based on their values, preferences, and family.** This type of empathy is particularly effective when approaching people you don’t like or who are very different from you, because if you try to assign your own values or cultural norms to other people, you’ll never understand them and potentially cause conflict.

- For example, some people think that a man crying is sensitive; others think this is weak.

To practice this skill, collect information about people, usually via conversation, to discover what makes them unique. The most valuable pieces of information come from childhood because this is when people develop their core values, often influenced by their parents and siblings. Learning more about someone’s present relationships with their parents and siblings can tell you about what their childhood was like.

Additionally, look at how people react to authority figures—this will tell you about their tendency towards rebelliousness or submission—and who they choose as their partners.

Most people like talking about themselves, but if you have trouble getting someone to open up, ask open-ended questions, or offer up some information about yourself to gain trust.

#### Skill #4: Seek Feedback

To improve your empathy, you need feedback, and you can get it in two ways:

- **Directly.** Once you’ve guessed at people’s thoughts or feelings, ask them what they’re actually thinking and feeling to see if your assessment was accurate. This usually works best with people you trust.
- **Indirectly.** Notice how well certain techniques seem to be changing your rapport.

To improve the quality and variety of your feedback, interact with as many different people as you can.

> **Extended Example: Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton**
> 
> Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton is an example of a healthy narcissist with a solid command of empathy. When Shackleton led an expedition to Antarctica and his ship became trapped in ice, he had to make the call to abandon the expedition—his dream—and find a way for himself and the crew to survive the winter. If they didn’t work together, they would die in the harsh climate. Shackleton used empathy to bring his crew together:
> 
> **1. He knew that his emotions would affect the crew’s, so he demonstrated confidence and competence,** both vocally and with his body language, to inspire the men to do the same.
> 
> - For example, the morning after abandoning ship, he got up early and made tea for everyone. He was optimistic as he served everyone.
> 
> **2. He had to focus on both the group’s dynamic and individuals’ feelings.** He assessed the group by taking note of the collective mood during work, mealtimes, and entertainment. He assessed individuals by reading their mood, trying to feel the same, and predicting what he (and therefore they) might do in the thrall of a particular emotion.
> 
> - Shackleton knew that Frank Hurley was a snob, so Shackleton shared a tent with him, which kept him away from the rest of the crew and also made him feel important because he was rooming with the leader.
> 
> **3. He had to be gentle when someone was feeling low or something went wrong.** Yelling at people wouldn’t improve things, so he’d either try to improve their mood or subtly isolate them so their mood didn’t spread to others.
> 
> - When Shackleton decided to try rowing to a nearby island, he knew he couldn’t leave Harry McNeish behind because he’d stir up trouble. However, McNeish didn’t like hard labor, and at one point, gave up on rowing. Instead of scolding him, which might make him rebel, Shackleton called for a break, saying that everyone, including himself, needed a rest.
