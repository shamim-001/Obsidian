## Chapter 6: Using Logotherapy to Combat Anxiety

Feeling like life is meaningless, thinking our choices have already been determined for us, and worrying about death can all cause feelings of anxiety over the meaning of our lives. Anxiety is a difficult feeling to break out of--by its very nature, anxiety is a feedback loop that keeps us fixated on the very thing that’s causing us anxiety. What can we do to face it down and help us break the cycle?

Frankl mentions two specific forms of anxiety, and logotherapy has two corresponding techniques to help you combat these forms.

_Hyper-intention_ _anxiety_ is **intense fixation on either yourself or something you want, which usually prevents you from achieving your desired goal precisely because you’re trying to force it to happen**.

- For instance, when you wake up in the middle of the night and try to force yourself to go back to sleep, very often the hyper-intention to sleep causes you to stay up longer.

_Anticipatory anxiety_ is where **you fear something bad happening, and the fear itself causes the very thing to happen**.

- For instance, someone who’s self-conscious about sweating too much when they’re nervous will get nervous, start to sweat, then get anxious about sweating too much, which increases their stress level and causes them to sweat _more._

Though these are 2 different types of anxiety, they usually result in the same outcome, and it’s rarely a good outcome.

- An example from the book: the more a person tries to orgasm during sex, the less likely they are to actually orgasm--but conversely, the more afraid someone is of _not_ orgasming during sex, the more likely their fear will come true. Same result, but different anxieties.

Logotherapy values **taking concrete action over philosophizing**, and there are two concrete steps you can take to help break these anxiety cycles: _dereflection_ and _paradoxical intention_.

- _Dereflection_ helps you focus on something bigger than or outside of yourself, which inadvertently helps you achieve your goals. This is one way to respond to hyper-intention.
    - The book gives an example of a woman who was having difficulty orgasming during sex with her partner. She’d been sexually abused as a child and had read research about all the sexual problems she was going to have as a survivor, so during sex she kept fixating on herself and waiting for those problems to arise.
    - Frankl helped the woman move the attention from herself to an external object--her partner. By focusing on her partner, she took the pressure and hyper-intention off herself and was able to orgasm.
- _Paradoxical intention_ has you consciously intend to do the thing you’re afraid of. This is one way to respond to anticipatory anxiety.
    - A doctor was anxious about how much he sweated. If he thought he was going to sweat, he got so anxious about it that he sweated profusely anyway_._
    - To break the patient of this cycle, Frankl told the doctor to aim for a paradoxical intention: to sweat as much as possible when he was anxious about sweating. Whenever the doctor felt anxious about perspiring, he flipped the narrative and thought, “If they thought I was sweaty last week, I’m going to sweat at least ten quarts right now!” Of course, when he tried to sweat, he couldn’t do it.

Both dereflection and paradoxical intention require you to **reorient your purpose and look outside yourself**, which is directly in keeping with logotherapy’s principles.
