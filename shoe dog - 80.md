# Shoe Dog

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## 1980

This is the final year detailed in Shoe Dog, the year when Nike finally goes public through its IPO.

Tired of the plodding pace with US Customs, Nike goes on the offense. First, Nike launches its own low-cost nylon shoe, called the One Line. The import duties use a comparable shoe as the pricing benchmark, giving rise to the $25 million price. By using their own shoe as the comparable, they might reduce the claim.

Next, they produce a TV ad telling the story of the little Oregon company fighting the big bad government. Being forced to do this was un-American, it says.

Finally, Nike files a $25 million antitrust suit against its competitors and rubber companies, who had conspired to cripple them.

With so much heat, US Customs decide they wanted to move on. They initiate settlement talks, starting at $20 million, then $15 million. Phil doesn’t want to pay anything, even though they need to resolve this to go public, and they need to go public to survive. Eventually, they settle on a final number - $9 million. Phil doesn’t like it, but he agrees. When writing the check, he muses that Nike has come a long way since he wrote his $1 million check in 1975 to pay Nissho – $1 million that he didn’t have.

Now they can go public, but Phil is still terrified of losing control of Nike, that thousands of shareholders will ruin the Nike culture. Their solution is to issue two classes of stock – ordinary class B shares with one vote, and preferred class A shares for the current team that would let them name ¾ of the board.

### Nike in China

Nike makes its first inroads into China. Two billion feet is their target prize. Phil wants Nike to be first, knowing it’ll be a huge advantage.

They recruit a China expert called David Chang, who gets them through the bureaucratic nightmare to get a tour in China, hosted by the Chinese government. They see landmarks like the Great Wall and visit old, decrepit factories that produce defective shoes. The Chinese find it common practice to wear mismatched shoes on the right and left. Phil is appalled, but he sees children in canvas shoes, which gives him hope.

Before leaving China, Nike signs endorsement deals with China’s track-and-field federation, which is run by the government. Four years later, the Chinese team appears at the LA Olympics wearing Nike shoes and clothes.

Nike also signs with two Chinese factories, officially becoming the first American shoemaker in 25 years to do business in China.

### Nike Goes Public

When they return from China, the IPO process is in full swing. In September, they file to create 20 million shares of class A stock and 30 million of class B. 30 million shares would be held in reserve, and 2 million class B shares are sold to the public, somewhere between $18 and $22 per share. 56% of the class A shares would be held by the early team – Bowerman, their earliest investors, the Buttfaces, and Phil, who would personally own 46%. They agree that Nike needs to be run by one person, with one steady vision.

They go on their IPO roadshow, convincing investors of the value of Nike. Phil tells stories to bankers about the company’s history, their dogged diligence, Bowerman’s experiments with his waffle iron. He wants the New York bankers to know that these Oregonians weren’t messing around.

This is a perfect time to be reflective and nostalgic. Phil remembers all the struggles they endured, not being able to pay Nissho, their paychecks bouncing, Johnson’s endless letters asking for encouragement. Phil’s mom remembers the first time she bought Phil’s Onitsuka shoes.

Phil wants no less than $22 per share. He believes they’re worth that much. A company called Apple is also going public that week, and he believes Nike is worth no less than they are. The bankers initially disagree, but Phil stands his ground, and they relent.

They finally go public. Instantly, the team is made. Bowerman is worth $9 million; Woodell, Johnson, Hayes and Strasser each about $6 million; Phil, $178 million.

Phil muses on becoming a businessman, a word he dislikes. To him, business isn’t about money or deals or fixing problems. It’s about the mission of contributing to other humans. It’s about making strangers happier or healthier, efficiently and intelligently.

He recalls all the sports matches he’s seen where a team had a big lead in the final quarter, relaxed, and lost the game. Even though he’s now wealthier than he had ever imagined, nothing had really changed. So he goes back to work.
