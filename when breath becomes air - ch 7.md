## Chapter 7: Reality Setting In

With my diagnosis nine months behind me, I attempted to recreate the trajectory of my pre-cancer life. I was weary and beaten down physically, but it was all worth it. In a just a couple of months, graduation would be upon me and life would settle into a manageable pace.

There was a job at a university in Wisconsin that encompassed everything I’d hoped for in a post-residency position. The pay was high. There was significant funding for a neuroscience lab. I would be in charge of my clinical service. There was time available, if needed, to address my illness. The position included a professorship with possible tenure. The town was quaint and beautiful. Lucy had a number of career opportunities to choose from. My dreams could be realized with this job.

I knew that without Emma, I could never have gotten back to this place. After my diagnosis, I couldn’t see a way back to who I was before, but she had kept my identity alive despite my misgivings. She had met me where I was and nurtured her moral obligation to lead me forward until I could see the path back to myself again.

Yet, despite the fantasy, I suddenly realized it wasn’t possible to ever be me again…not completely. I also knew there was no way I could take this job. Before, my identity was that of a man with an open playing field without borders. Now, there was a major border. Cancer was part of this new life, and it could return or wreak havoc at any time.

If we moved to Wisconsin, Lucy would be far away from her support system. She would be alone with a child and me to care for. My bravado of the past few months, in which I’d denied cancer any power in my life, smacked me in the face. The reality of life now made the fantasy of reclaiming that life vivid and foolish. No matter how many strides away from cancer I made, it was always trailing behind.

The self-conceit I’d entertained as a physician, believing all I had to do was guide patients and families through the murky waters of death until they could either beat it or face it, was now apparent. Even if the surgery is a success and the patient is released to life once again, that life is forever changed.

Emma hadn’t helped me face death and reclaim my life. She’d helped guide me to a place where a new identity could be sought. I finally understood that that task was the only one at hand.

### Only Human After All

The confluence of so many things were afoot seven months after I’d gone back to work. I went in for my last scan before graduation, before our baby was born, and before my new future self began. Unlike previous scans, when I reviewed them right away, I had to wait. Patients and duties of both the chief resident and physician needed my attention.

Two hours after my scan, I opened up the scans of my current patients, reviewing them and making plans for how to approach the following day. When I was finished, I pulled up my scans from earlier, going through them with the same casual attention I had with my patients’. I didn’t see it at first. But once I did, it was all I could see. Taking up the middle of my right lung was a new sizable tumor.

I took in this information without fear or frustration. It was a certainty as any other, like the rotation of the Earth.

Lucy and I understood what would come next. The tumor would be biopsied and then treatment. Chemo would likely be needed, and things would be harder than last time. We also understood that whatever time we’d thought I had left was now truncated.

We would find out for sure what my life would become on the following Monday, a few days away. My ability to work as a neurosurgeon would be on hold for a while or for good. Until then, I would continue on as planned, which meant operating in a surgery the next day I was already scheduled for.

I went in to work, scrubbed, possibly for the final time, and performed the procedure successfully. I packed up seven years of personal items, leaving my books for those that came after. I became emotional sitting in my car waiting to leave. But when I got home, I stashed away the items that made me a doctor---white coat, hospital badge, pager, scrubs---and turned to face another new future.

### Round Two of Treatment

Emma confirmed what Lucy and I had expected as the next steps. When I told her I was stepping away from work, she didn’t argue this time. She said she understood, as long as I understood that her agreeing wasn’t based on anything different about my condition. I was in the same state of health I had been in days earlier. She wasn’t giving up on my return to the life I wanted, and I shouldn’t either.

I was back on the opposite side of the doctor-patient relationship, back up against a foe that was proving how strong it was despite my strength. Still, Emma’s words were reassuring, as was her advice to simply be a patient, not a doctor involved in my own care, a role I had never considered.

I started chemotherapy on a Monday, and the effects were immediate. I was depleted of energy and the desire to eat. I had to be fed by a tube, and after a few days, life revolved around these timed feedings and languoring in front of the television. I would start to feel better just in time for the next round of chemo.

My time back at work had successfully convinced the neurosurgery department that I had fulfilled the requirements for graduation. The day came for the ceremony, with Lucy still two weeks out from her due date. I was getting ready to accept the marker of seven years of training and persistence when a nausea like nothing I’d felt before came over me. I became violently ill and was taken to the ER, instead of the ceremony.

A medical resident was in charge of my care, trying to rehydrate me after the vomiting turned into diarrhea. I discussed my history with him, including medications, which still included Tarceva. We developed a plan to proceed. I was admitted to the hospital so I could continue IV fluids under observation.

That night, I learned that the resident had removed Tarceva from my list of medications. I had no idea how he felt capable enough to make that decision on his own and challenged it. I told him that Emma was a proponent of Tarceva, but he was adamant the drug was the likely culprit of my current state. I was livid, partly because I knew the likelihood of searing pain I could start to experience without the Tarceva.

In response to my protests, he questioned whether the situation was an actual crisis or could wait to be resolved in the morning. At that moment, I realized I was not going to get the Tarceva. He was more concerned about appearing incompetent to his bosses than fulfilling his responsibility to my care.

The next day, the symptoms I came in with worsened, and my kidneys started to malfunction. I became so dehydrated, my mouth was like sandpaper. My labs showed fatal levels of serum sodium. I was taken to the ICU, where I would stay for enough time for Lucy’s due date to pass.

In the ICU, I ventured in and out of consciousness. At times, I was lucid enough to understand that a myriad of doctors were working on my case, each with a myriad of ideas about what my care should be. When I was able, and with Lucy’s help, I tried to detail my condition to generate some order in my care and keep the doctors on track. When I wasn’t of sound mind, these details could be read back to me.

Emma finally took charge and assuaged the chaotic environment during my stay. I was still incoherent often, but I knew I was in good hands with Emma.

### From the Darkness Emerges Light

Forty pounds lighter since my diagnosis, I was slated for discharge from the hospital. I was back to my eighth-grade weight. I was lucid again but worn. My skin was a mere sheath over my bones, and simple acts, like keeping my head upright or drinking a glass of water, were taxing. And I was no longer able to read.

Treatment would have to wait until I was in better shape, and experimental trials were out of the question in my condition. The next time I saw Emma, she told me that I likely had another five years ahead of me, but the words rang hollow. She was no longer the poised, assertive guide. She was a hopeful companion in the dark tunnel searching for light.

On my way home from meeting with Emma, Lucy went into labor. My father brought me to the hospital, and on a cot, I lay in the delivery room covered in blankets and heating packs. We waited for two hours for Lucy’s final push. On the Fourth of July, our daughter, Elizabeth Acadia, was born. We called her Cady for short.

I held my swaddled baby and Lucy’s hand at the same time, both of us peering down into the face of life. The finality of my death was still a question, but instead of all the “what ifs,” holding Cady, I now saw a clean slate on which anything was possible.
