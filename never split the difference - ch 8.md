## Chapter 8: Ensure Implementation

So far, Voss has demonstrated how calculated empathy, reflecting back, labeling, anticipating their accusations, and asking open-ended questions can get your counterpart to feel secure and in control, thereby making them more likely to reveal their true wants and needs—giving you the power to bring them around to _your_ wants and needs by harnessing their cognitive biases against them.

But even after you’ve gotten your counterpart to agree to your terms, there’s still one problem—how can you trust them to follow through? Voss notes that even if you get a “yes,” if there’s no way for your counterpart to actually follow through, this is useless—because **“yes” is nothing without “how.”**

In this chapter, Voss explores how to move beyond mere agreement and toward _implementation_. Specifically, he looks at:

- How open-ended questions can help ensure implementation by playing to your counterpart’s empathy and making them feel they’re helping you solve a problem
- The speech patterns and non-verbal cues that can signal an unreliable counterpart

### Give Your Counterpart Skin in the Game

In this section, we’re going to revisit Voss’s idea of open-ended questions and explore it from a new angle.

**We’ve seen how Voss writes that asking open-ended questions keeps your counterpart engaged, but off-balance**. It also forces them to consider _your_ position. This is crucial when ensuring implementation. By asking questions like “How can I do that?” or “How can we ensure that we follow through on what we’ve agreed to today?” you transform your counterpart into a _partner_ helping you solve a shared problem. It’s much harder for them to wriggle out of a commitment if you can get them to see your negotiation as a puzzle they’re helping you solve—especially if you successfully make them think that _they’re_ the one coming up with the solutions. Asking these open-ended questions and making them work through the answers gives them a much greater stake and investment in the ultimate solution.

> **Objective Standards and Implementation**
> 
> In _[Getting to Yes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-to-yes/1-page-summary)_, Fisher and Ury take a more rationalistic, less emotion-based approach to implementation. They write that what they call “positional negotiations” are really just a battle of wills, in which both parties stick rigidly to their positions until one side is forced to back down. This tends to make the agreement inefficient, uncivil, and difficult to implement, because one side is being dragged to the solution unwillingly and resentfully.
> 
> A better alternative, they argue, is to negotiate an agreement measured against objective standards, independent of the will of either side. When you use objective standards, such as market value or average salaries, you’re basing the agreement on principle instead of succumbing to pressure tactics or threats. For example, in a salary negotiation, if an employer is dealing with an employee who’s upset that she isn’t being offered as large a raise as she’d like, the manager can appeal to an objective standard by saying, “I have these figures here showing average salaries for your position in our market for companies of our size. As you can see, what we’re offering is well in line with those numbers, and in fact, above average. We value you as an employee and want you to _feel_ valued, but we think what we’ve offered here is fair.”
> 
> According to Fisher and Ury, objective standards relying on precedent, scientific merit, and community practices strengthen the agreement — making it less vulnerable to attack and more fully committing both parties to its smooth implementation.

#### The Fundraiser and the Delinquent Donor: An Implementation Case Study

We can see this with a hypothetical case study.

Imagine Karen is a fundraiser for a major American university. Let’s further imagine that one of her donors signed a multi-year pledge in which they agreed to give $250,000 to the university for five consecutive years. As part of the gift agreement, the university agreed to name one of the new residence halls after the donor. After following through on the gift pledge for the first two years, the donor has reneged in the third year and is now six months behind the giving schedule.

Despite the non-payment, the donor’s name was already added to the residence hall (which represents an opportunity cost for the university because that prominent display could be given to another donor who _would_ pay on time). Moreover, the donor is still expecting to receive other perks and benefits of being a major benefactor (like free tickets to events on campus and invitations to select lunches with the university president and faculty). Naturally, Karen would be frustrated. **She needs to resolve this issue, while still maintaining a good relationship with the donor.**

How might she begin to fix the situation and get the donor to comply with the agreement? She might manage it by using a mix of summaries and open-ended questions to steer the donor toward her preferred solution (resuming his gift payments) and show him that the only way he could get what he wanted (special treatment by the university and his name continuing to be displayed on the residence hall) would be by satisfying _her_ needs first.

- As a first step during a phone call with the donor, Karen could summarize the situation—that the university had prominently displayed his name on a prime campus piece of real estate, that he’d been given privileged access to university events, that important student programs had been budgeted based on the expectation that he would fulfill his pledge, _and_ that he expected all of this to continue despite him being in default on his pledge. **If the donor sheepishly responds to her summary with a “That’s right,” (as might be expected, because she’s correctly summed up the situation) Karen will know she had the upper hand.**
- Then, she can deliver the coup de grâce, her open-ended question: **“How can I do that?” This would be a powerful way of telling the donor “no” without explicitly saying “no.”**
- This would reshape the negotiation environment. Now, the donor can understand _her_ problem and would feel compelled to devise a solution to that problem. In effect, **she would put the donor to work for _her_.**

The donor’s response might reasonably be exactly what Karen wants to hear: “We know the university can’t continue to do all the great things it’s doing and continue to treat me so well without me following through on my gift commitment. I’ve been having some cash-flow problems on my end, but **it’s unacceptable for you to not have been paid. I will send you a check for my $250,000 gift installment by the end of the week.**”

While this is a hypothetical example, it realistically replicates many of the situations that Voss relates, and it demonstrates how he coached clients to respond to difficult issues.

### Evaluate the Follow-Through

Of course, Voss warns that **many negotiations involve more parties than just the people at the table**. Getting buy-in from your direct counterpart isn’t worth much if the people outside the room can block your counterpart from following through. For example, a car dealer may agree to your terms for purchasing a car. But if she doesn’t really have the authority to make that deal and her boss can just nix it when she takes it back behind closed doors, you haven’t really won anything by just winning the dealer over.

That’s why Voss stresses the importance of figuring out the motivations of the people _behind_ your direct counterpart. Ask how this will affect _them_. **There are always dealmakers and deal-killers**. And when you suspect that decisions are really being made by committee, you need to know what that committee really wants. After all, it could take only one member of the committee to kill your deal.

Open-ended “how” questions once again show their usefulness by helping you identify where these sorts of implementation problems may occur. Asking questions like “How does your boss feel about this deal?” or “How do you think the rest of your team will react?” will make your counterpart think through how to ensure implementation on their side.

> **Fear of Conflict and Failure to Commit**
> 
> In _[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/1-page-summary)_, Patrick Lencioni labels failure to commit to a decision as one of the main dysfunctions that undermines team effectiveness. Lencioni argues that teams need to be committed and on the same page in order to succeed. There can be no ambiguity around what goals the organization is trying to achieve, and all team members must fully buy into the plan.
> 
> Dysfunctional teams, however, fail to achieve commitment, and instead they lumber from one non-decision to the next. If you were negotiating with a representative from a dysfunctional team, you would see this immediately—the person you were dealing with would have no ability to actually commit to what you agreed because she would be undermined by her team.
> 
> Lencioni writes that the problem stems from a fear of conflict. When teammates haven’t had the opportunity to hash out disagreements through productive, ideological debate, they feel that their ideas haven’t been properly considered. It’s also harder to make any decision when alternative points of view have not been considered, because it feels there might be better options that lay undiscovered. The result is a lack of commitment—ambiguity about goals, confusion regarding individual responsibilities, and indecision.

### Language Cues

Voss advises that another way you can evaluate whether or not your counterpart is reliable is by examining their language cues. He highlights several verbal and nonverbal cues that can help you determine whether you're dealing with an honest broker who will work with you to implement your agreement—or a liar who’ll try to wriggle out of their commitment.

#### Watch the Pronouns

Voss writes that you can observe your counterpart’s speech patterns to see whether or not this person is truly integral to the decision-making process. Specifically, Voss warns, be on the lookout for their use of pronouns.

**The person _really_ in charge seldom says “I” or “me.” Instead, they deflect to third-party pronouns**, saying things like, “We’ll have to see if that’s a realistic path forward for us” or “We’ll have to review internally before we can commit to anything.” This is because they wisely don’t want to be tied down to a decision and are skillfully creating the illusion that they can’t agree to your terms because there’s a nebulous “other” entity whose buy-in they must first secure.

Conversely, you’re likely dealing with a low-level player if you hear them dropping a lot of first-person pronouns like “I” or “me.”

> **Leadership and First-Person Pronouns**
> 
> Some studies contradict Voss’s assertion that the use of first-person pronouns is a sign of low status.
> 
> Researchers looked at how high-level corporate officers like CEOs and CFOs used pronouns on earnings conference calls (which have become increasingly high-profile interactions that attract a great deal of media attention). The purpose of the study was to see how investors reacted to the use of singular pronouns (like “I” and “me”) versus plural pronouns (like “we,” “us,” and “they”).
> 
> Studying over 90,000 such conference calls that took place over a span of 20 years, the researchers found that [CEOs using first-person singular pronouns received a better response from investors](https://www.sandiego.edu/news/detail.php?_focus=79239), who felt that the use of these pronouns demonstrated honesty, responsibility, and empathy. Conversely, those CEOS who leaned heavily on pronouns like “us” or “we” were more likely to be seen by investors as craven, weak, and trying to evade accountability.
> 
> This points to a possible difference between how leaders speak and how people interpret them, and may indicate a limitation of Voss’s theory. Leaders who are aware of people’s preference for ‘I’ pronouns may use them for that reason, nullifying Voss’s technique. However, Voss is relating the patterns of behavior he has witnessed in his years of experience, so he might argue that a negotiator is more _likely_ to interact with leaders who use third-person pronouns. Thus, while accounting for possible exceptions, negotiators looking for verbal cues can probably rely on his approach.

#### Pay Attention to Non-Verbal Communication

Voss also warns negotiators to be on the lookout for non-verbal language cues. He points to findings from UCLA that give a percentage breakdown for how people communicate:

- 7% of a message comes from words
- 38% comes from tone
- 55% comes from body language

Words alone tell you just a sliver of what your counterpart is really saying. Voss urges you to **watch for inconsistencies between words, tone, and body language.**

Think of someone who’s saying pleasant things like “Good morning” or “How are you?” but with a blank expression or in a tone devoid of any warmth. This is why telemarketers are told to smile, even when they’re speaking to people on the phone—the customer can “hear” the friendly expression on the telemarketer’s face.

Voss writes that you can use labels to further shed light on the incongruence between someone’s words and nonverbal body language. If they’re _saying_ all the right things but you doubt their commitment, you can say, “I’m glad you say you agree, but it seems like there was some hesitation there. It’s important that we get this right and that you feel comfortable.” This will make them feel respected, and will make you a trustworthy partner in their eyes.

> Other authors have noted the importance of nonverbal communication but have observed that men and women have different levels of aptitude in understanding and interpreting it. In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/1-page-summary)_, Daniel Goleman writes that women are better at picking up verbal and nonverbal cues, and at expressing and articulating their feelings. Men, meanwhile, are adept at masking “weak” emotions such as hurt, fear, guilt, or vulnerability.
> 
> If we pick up on Voss’s ideas about the importance of non-verbal communication, Goleman’s work would appear to suggest that women would be more effective negotiators in face-to-face situations, since they are more attuned to body language, facial expressions, and other below-the-radar signals that might indicate their counterpart’s true emotional state. It could also be taken to suggest that you need to be more aware of your non-verbal communication if you’re negotiating with a female counterpart. With respect to men, Goleman’s findings also suggest that looking for signs of weakness, shame, or fear in a male negotiating counterpart would be an ineffective strategy, since they are so adept at masking these emotions.)

#### Spotting a Liar

Sometimes, Voss warns, you’re going to come up against a dishonest or unscrupulous counterpart. He advises you to cut off negotiations when you see that this is the case—there’s no deal to be had if the other person’s word is useless. But what are the signs of a liar?

Voss writes that **liars tend to be more verbose and use more complicated, rambling sentences**—hoping to draw your attention away from the web of dishonesty they’re weaving around you. He says they also use more distant, third-person pronouns like “they,” “them,” and “we.” **They tend to avoid saying “I” or “me.” Psychologically, this helps the liar distance herself from the lie.**

> Voss writes that liars rely heavily on third-person pronouns, but we’ve _also_ seen that people in positions of power do the same thing to avoid being pinned down to a definite position. While these two assertions aren’t completely mutually exclusive—it’s of course possible for a person in a position of power to _also_ be dishonest—it’s important to not conflate the two. Both are examples of deflection, but they are not the same thing.
> 
> If you’re talking to a CEO, for example, and you notice that she’s using a lot of third-person pronouns, you shouldn’t immediately conclude that she’s lying or trying to mislead you. Instead, she may be trying to deflect in order to avoid being too tied down to any particular course of action—that’s her being _strategic_, not dishonest. In order to distinguish between the two scenarios, keep asking open-ended questions, watching for tonal and nonverbal cues, and listening for key bits of information that your counterpart might reveal.
