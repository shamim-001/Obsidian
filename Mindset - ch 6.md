## Chapter 6: Mindset in Relationships

**Whether you have a fixed or growth mindset affects the course of your personal relationships**. Mindset helps explain:

- Why people work against their own interests in relationships
- Why relationships devolve into warfare
- Why some relationships succeed and others don’t

### Coping with Rejection

The road to satisfying relationships is marked with disappointments, mistakes, and most devastating of all, rejection. When they experience setbacks, **some people are able to heal and move on to better relationships, while others remain stuck or scarred. The difference is mindset.**

Researchers recruited 100 people to describe their experience of rejection. The study compared how those with fixed mindsets handled it versus those with growth mindsets:

- People with fixed mindsets felt judged and labeled as a failure or unlovable. They reacted angrily to the person who rejected them and were obsessed with getting revenge or making that person suffer.
- People with growth mindsets wanted to understand, learn, and move on to more successful relationships. They didn’t feel labeled but instead looked for insights about themselves and lessons such as the importance of communicating. Rather than revenge, their top goal was to forgive.

As an example of a growth-oriented response to an extreme rejection, one woman described being stood up at the altar on her wedding day — the groom had taken off on their planned honeymoon trip to Tahiti by himself. She decided to go ahead with the reception and dinner anyway, with the support and fellowship of her guests. To cap the evening, she danced solo to the song, “I Will Survive.” The evening helped her start the healing process. A few years later, she married in the same wedding dress at the same church.

We’ll cover more examples of how fixed and growth minded people deal with relationship problems in the rest of this chapter.

### Fixed-Mindset Myths about Love

Because having a fixed mindset means you believe traits are set in stone, you have several beliefs about your relationship:

- Your traits are fixed and unchangeable.
- Your partner’s traits are unchangeable.
- Your relationship is unchangeable: **it was either meant to be or not to be**. If it was meant to be, you’ll live in perfect harmony, happily ever after.

If you have a growth mindset, you believe the opposite — that you, your partner, and your relationship can grow.

Of course, everyone wants to believe their relationship is unique and special. There’s nothing wrong with that — if you avoid the following pitfalls and myths of fixed-mindset thinking.

#### It’s Magic

People with fixed mindsets believe that if two people are right for each other, their relationship should always be smooth sailing. Compatibility means everything should come naturally and you shouldn’t have to work on your relationship. If you have troubles, then the relationship wasn’t meant to be. (Relationship experts say this is one of the most harmful beliefs you can have in a relationship.)

In contrast, the growth-minded view is that they’ll work together to learn relationship skills, solve problems, and grow. Success comes from work and commitment, not magic.

#### You Can Read Minds

**People with fixed mindsets believe partners should be so in sync that they can read each other’s minds**. Of course, this is impossible. You need to communicate, not try to read minds. It’s easy to misinterpret what the other person says or means.

For instance, when the author’s partner asked for more space, she thought he was talking about changing or ending the relationship. But he only wanted more room where they were sitting.

#### You Should Agree on Everything

In addition to mind-reading, **many fixed-mindset people believe two people in a relationship should have the same views about everything**. A study showed how this works. Researchers asked couples to discuss their views of the relationship. People with fixed mindsets felt threatened and irritated when even tiny discrepancies in how they each saw the relationship came to light.

However, it’s impossible to share the same beliefs and assumptions about everything. It takes effort to communicate honestly and accurately, to understand each other’s views, and to resolve conflicts. You can live “happily ever after,” but it takes work.

#### Problems Equal Character Flaws

**Those with fixed mindsets see problems as a sign of a character flaw.** When conflicts occur, they look for something to blame — often their partner’s personality. They can become angry and disgusted with their partner, an attitude they extend to the whole relationship. Since they believe traits are set in stone, the problem is unsolvable. Or, to avoid believing the relationship can’t be fixed, they may deny problems instead.

Some people keep dating one person after another because they’re trying to find the perfect person. For instance, one woman from the study, Penelope, dated a string of men but always broke up when she discovered what she considered to be a flaw, such as watching too much television. These flaws were small things that could have been addressed with tolerance or communication, but she preferred to move on because she believed there was someone out there who was already perfect.

Everyone has flaws or things that look like flaws to us. Problems are normal occurrences in relationships. **Growth-minded people accept flaws — they believe a person or relationship can still be good without being perfect.** They also believe people can grow.

For example, after a special prosecutor uncovered Bill Clinton’s relationship with an intern, which he had lied about to his wife, Hillary Clinton had to decide whether his lying was a fixed trait or whether he could improve with help and commitment. She believed he could change and they went to counseling one full day a week for a year.

#### Your Partner is Your Competitor

In a fixed mindset where you have to keep proving yourself, it’s easy to get into a competition with your partner over who’s more talented or intelligent. Here’s an extreme example: Cynthia always felt competitive and had to outdo her partners in the areas most important to them. For instance, when she developed a relationship with an actor, she started writing successful plays. These actions chased the men away. She didn’t allow them to have their own identity. She said she was just showing interest in their interests, but in reality, she needed to equal or surpass them at everything.

### Helping Each Other Develop

In healthy relationships, partners are on the same side, not competing or battling constantly. They develop the skills to handle differences — both partners grow and the relationship grows. Each helps the other achieve and become the person they want to be.

For example, Laura encouraged Jack in his plans to start a business, and Jack encouraged Laura to pursue her dream of writing a children’s book. When they were first married, Laura was prone to yelling and being defensive, but Jack didn’t take it personally and helped her learn to handle things constructively. A relationship is an opportunity for two people to help each other grow.

#### Friendship

Friendships are also relationships in which people can help each other grow and develop. A friend can give you the courage to take big steps. Friends validate each other (“You did the right thing”) and affirm each other’s positive qualities. Despite the danger of praising someone’s traits, everyone needs reassurance at times that they’re inherently OK.

However, **a fixed mindset can interfere with a friendship if someone needs to prove themselves at another’s expense**. Researchers studying adolescent boys found that when boys with a fixed mindset endorsed negative stereotypes about girls, their self-esteem rose. Thinking that girls were stupid made them feel superior. Another kind of fixed-mindset friend who could be harmful is someone who makes you feel bad about yourself; they build themselves up by establishing your inferiority.

#### Shyness

Shyness can keep people from developing relationships. It affects people with fixed mindsets as well as those with growth mindsets, but **shyness is a bigger problem for fixed-mindset people.** They fear others’ judgment more. But research shows that **moving to a growth mindset can help shy people handle anxiety-producing social situations better.**

Researchers who watched shy people interact found that shy people with fixed mindsets had more difficulty with social interaction than shy people with growth mindsets did. Both had difficulty in the beginning of a conversation with a stranger, but after the first five minutes, shy growth-oriented people became more comfortable and enjoyed the interaction more. The reason is that the growth-oriented shy people viewed the interaction as a challenge. Although they felt anxious initially, they focused on the potential benefits of meeting someone new.

The lesson is that growth-minded shy people can take control of their shyness, despite being nervous. Shyness doesn’t stymie them the way it does people with fixed mindsets who are afraid of making mistakes.

### Grow Your Mindset: Tips

- After a rejection, do you feel an urge to get revenge, or would you rather learn from what went wrong in the relationship and move on? Think of a past rejection and try to look at it with a growth mindset. What did you learn from it that could help you improve a future relationship?
- When a problem of conflict comes up in your relationship, do you react by blaming the other person? Create a fictional character with a name and blame him instead. Then think about what you can do rather than whom to blame.
- If you’re shy, adopting a growth mindset can help. Remember that you can learn and improve social skills with practice. Think of social interactions as opportunities to expand your network and to learn something new, instead of worrying about being judged.
