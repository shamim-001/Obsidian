## Law #14: People Have Attitudes

In the previous law, we learned about the first idiosyncratic element of self-sabotaging (compulsiveness). Now, we’ll look at the second: attitude.

People think that they see the world objectively, but in fact, everyone sees a slightly different version of things, filtered by their perception, or attitude. (You can also think of attitude as your soul or life force.) Our moods vary, but **in general, we all have an overarching emotion that we filter the world through.** This is caused by our brains’ inherent and unconscious sensitivity to particular stimuli.

- For example, if our overall attitude is sadness, when we see sad things, our brain fires strongly, and the strength of the firing makes us pay attention and feel sad.

**Our attitudes are determined by some of the same factors that set our characters: genetics and upbringing. We further hone our attitudes as we meet other people and have new experiences.** When we encounter people we admire or like, they influence how we see the world. When we have a negative experience, we want to avoid the same thing happening, so we narrow our perspectives. Our attitude is constantly reformulating but we always have traces of its earliest shape.

There are two major types of attitudes. People experience moments of each, but in general, tend one way or another:

**Type #1: Negative and limited.** People with this attitude are scared of life so they avoid anything new because the larger their world gets, the less they can control. This attitude often develops in childhood if children don’t have support systems.

**Type #2: Positive and open.** People with this attitude are less scared and therefore are open to trying new things.

Attitudes affect more than just how we _view_ the world—they affect how we _interact_ with it. They drive many of our actions and affect our energy levels and health. Additionally, they’re self-fulfilling prophecies—when our attitude is negative, we expect bad things to happen to us, and because this makes us timid and narrow-minded, bad things _do_ happen.

- For example, if you go into an interaction with someone expecting them to be rude, they pick up on your negative emotions and reflect them back at you. This confirms your belief that people are negative.

In this law, we’ll learn how to manage toxic types and control our own nature.

### Manage Toxic Types and Control Your Own Nature: Negative and Positive Attitudes

First, we’ll look at five negative attitudes and how to manage them in others and ourselves. Then, we’ll look at how to become more positive.

#### Five Negative Attitudes

There are five common varieties of negative attitudes. Often, people hold more than one because negative emotions amplify each other. For example, someone who’s hostile is likely to also feel angry.

As you read through the following types, determine if you fit them by reflecting on how you:

- **Judge others.** If you focus on people’s negatives, you probably have a negative attitude. If you forgive their flaws, you’re probably more positive.
- **Handle hard times.** If you blame others, minimize your own mistakes, hate change, and rile when challenged, you may have a negative attitude.
- **Inspire responses in others,** especially nonverbal ones. If people are scared of you or defensive, you may have a negative attitude.

##### Type #1: Hostile

**People with this attitude view the world as being constantly against them. To deal with this, they become hostile so that _they’re_ the source of the emotion and have more control of it.** They unconsciously provoke hostility in others—for example, by being late—and this confirms their attitude that the world is hostile. They want to feel attacked and want revenge.

The hostile attitude stems from one or both of the following childhood experiences:

- The parents were abusive or punishing.
- The child interpreted becoming independent from their parents as a forced, hostile separation.

You can identify people with hostile attitudes by the following characteristics:

- They anger easily.
- According to them, their life is full of back-stabbing, persecuting, combative people, and they never deserve it.
- They usually struggle professionally.

**When you encounter those with hostile attitudes, don’t let them provoke you into hostility.** Your neutrality will confuse them and leave them unable to retaliate against you.

If you see any signs of a hostile attitude in yourself, **whenever you meet someone, think positive thoughts about them.** For example, imagine that you like them before you start talking. Probably, you’ll notice that they’re not doing anything negative, which shows that the hostility you usually experience stems from you.

##### Type #2: Depressive

**People with this attitude are predisposed to see the world as negative,** and they respond in the same way as people with hostile attitudes—they become the source of the emotion so that they have some control.

The depressive attitude stems from childhood and develops from children feeling like their parents don’t love them. They’re too young to think that their parents are imperfect, so they assume that they’re unloved because there’s something wrong with them.

You can identify people with depressive attitudes by the following characteristics:

- They appear sensitive and in need of help.
- They temporarily isolate themselves. This puts their depression back in their control, rather than having it stem from circumstances or people they meet.
- They secretly want to hurt others and are good at making them feel guilty or sad.
- They encourage others to hurt them so they can feel depressed.
- They self-sabotage because they don’t believe they deserve success.

When you encounter those with this attitude, don’t try to convince them that life is good. **Let them maintain their depressed opinions but invite them to do things with you that will increase their energy levels, which will naturally improve their mood.**

**If you see any signs of this attitude in yourself, realize that your body is telling you to take a break.** You’ll only feel low temporarily. If your depression is ongoing, increase your energy level by working at something, especially something artistic. Art benefits from sensitivity.

##### Type #3: Anxious

**People with this attitude are scared of losing control.** They expect that everything is hard, and everyone will eventually let them down, which makes them anxious even before anything bad happens.

You can identify people with anxious attitudes by the following characteristics:

- They avoid new places and experiences.
- They mask their need for control as love. For example, when Franklin Roosevelt caught polio, his mother, under the guise of taking care of him, confined him to his room and tried to get him to give up politics.
- They act brittle so people will be scared to criticize them.
- They try to please people to head off unexpected future behavior.
- At work, they’ll be controlling micromanagers or perfectionists.
- In relationships, they’ll take charge of the home.

**When you encounter those with anxious attitudes, give off calming nonverbal signals.** This will encourage them to mirror you and possibly soothe them.

If you see any signs of this attitude in yourself:

- Channel your need for control into work or a project.
- Let people act naturally to demonstrate to yourself that nothing bad happens when you don’t control them.
- Put yourself in situations you’re scared of, which will help you realize that what you fear isn’t as bad as you anticipated.

##### Type #4: Avoidant

**People with this attitude are insecure, often about their intelligence or ability.** They want to avoid situations where they might be judged, so they try not to finish things. They’re scared of both failure and success—failure because it comes with judgment, and success because they’ll have to keep living up to it.

The avoidant attitude has possible childhood roots:

- They were shamed for excelling.
- Their parents made them feel judged or uncomfortable about bad behavior or attempts to compete with siblings.

You can identify people with avoidant attitudes by the following characteristics:

- They always bow out of commitments. This can either be intentional or unconscious. For example, they’ll leave a job before their contract is up.
- They get sick at convenient moments, often with something psychosomatic.
- They set up an excuse for when things go wrong so they can’t be blamed. For example, they’ll purposely start a project late so they can use not having enough time as an excuse.
- They job-hop and never have long-term relationships. The longer they stay in a situation, the more likely people are to get to know them well enough to see their flaws.
- They might try to hide their avoidant tendencies by acting holier-than-thou because if their ideals are unrealistic, they’ll never be held accountable.

**When you encounter people with this attitude, avoid getting into personal or professional relationships with them.** Don’t try to help them—you won’t be able to. They’re too entrenched.

**If you see any signs of this attitude in yourself, start a small project and finish it.** Anticipate that you might fail, so that if you do, it won’t hurt that much because you’ve already prepared yourself for it. The fact that you completed the project, whatever the outcome, will increase your self-esteem because you’re so unused to finishing things.

##### Type #5: Resentful

**People with this attitude are self-centered and take everything personally. They always feel wronged and oppressed.** They’re constantly looking for nonverbal cues that indicate disrespect and can't deal with unfairness. They don’t lash out but instead stew and eventually retaliate. They sometimes become leaders.

You can identify people with resentful attitudes by the following characteristics:

- They’re arrogant and often give off disdainful nonverbal cues.
- They’re not always capable of bottling up their emotions and sometimes pettiness sneaks out.
- They’re bitter.
- Their past is full of conflict.
- They judge others.

When you encounter those with this attitude, be very careful not to do anything that they could misconstrue as insulting—they’ll hold on to this forever. **The best thing to do is stay away from them as much as possible** because even if you don’t do anything insulting, they’ll read it into one of your actions sooner or later.

**If you see any signs of this attitude in yourself, avoid bottling up emotions.** It’s better to react angrily in the moment than to keep ruminating.

#### Adopt a Positive Attitude

There are several benefits to adopting a positive attitude. If you change your attitude, you can change your circumstances. Additionally, if you become more positive and open, your health might improve because you’ll be more energetic (the mind and body are linked). Finally, having a positive attitude gives you more control over your life because it stimulates your willpower.

To make your attitude more positive, change your view of the following elements:

**Element #1: The world.** Imagine that you’re an explorer excited to dive into the unknown. Don’t cling to what you already know, look for new material, whether that’s in your unconsciousness, such as your dreams, or outside yourself. Don’t worry about seeming consistent—you can change your mind whenever. Or, imagine that you’re your younger self, and try to regain the curiosity you had as a child. This will make you more creative.

**Element #2: Adversity.** You can’t usually control what adversity is directed at you, but you can control your response. Think of all obstacles and setbacks as opportunities to learn or become stronger.

- For example, when Malcolm Little (Malcolm X) went to prison for burglary, he used his time to read, study, and earn a degree.

**Element #3: Yourself.** Don’t accept the limits and criticisms others try to impose on you. Believe that you’ll do something great.

**Element #4: Health.** When we have more energy—for example, we’re excited because we’ve just fallen in love—we tend to be healthier. To help yourself go beyond your self-imposed physical limits, feel excited.

**Element #5: Others.** Most of the time, people aren’t directing negativity at you personally. See people as neutral. Even if someone really is out to get you, feeling calm will put you in a better position to appropriately respond.

Also, try to create the peak experiences we learned about in Law #10: People Have Conflicted Feelings, Especially About Authority Figures. These moments can create a permanent change in your attitude because they expand your world. Create these moments by:

- Pushing yourself past your self-imposed limits or overcoming a major obstacle
- Visiting a different culture
- Falling in love

> **Extended Example: Anton Chekhov**
> 
> Anton Chekhov’s upbringing was fairly negative—he experienced a lot of hardship in his life and several of his family members were toxic types. **However, Anton ultimately embraced a positive, open attitude by controlling his response to adversity and overcoming obstacles.**
> 
> Anton’s father Pavel beat him and his siblings when they were children and forced Anton to work at the family’s grocery shop. He hated working there because it was cold, it took time away from his education, the customers were unruly, and if he ever made a mistake with money, Pavel would beat him further. **Anton dealt with this by learning to laugh (sometimes mean-spiritedly) at the townspeople.**
> 
> When Anton was 16, the grocery store was in serious debt and Pavel ran away to Moscow to avoid the debtor’s prison. His mother was left to deal with creditors and after being swindled, took the rest of the family except Anton, who was finishing school, to Moscow as well.
> 
> **Anton was furious, bitter, and depressed.** He was alone and very poor and was forced to start tutoring to feed himself. While tutoring didn’t pay well enough to even buy boots, Anton was surprised to find that he enjoyed it and that he enjoyed academia in general. He decided he wanted to go to medical school and studied hard.
> 
> One day, as a result of his studies in philosophy and literature, he started to understand his father. Pavel came from a long line of serfs, had been beaten by his own father, and had never wanted to work in a grocery store. Now that Anton realized his father was mainly just helpless, he could love him. **Nothing changed about Anton’s circumstances when he came to this realization—he still lived in an isolated, miserable town and was still very poor. The only thing that changed was his attitude.**
> 
> Anton went on to join his family in Moscow and helped them improve their own attitudes. He eventually became a doctor and writer.
