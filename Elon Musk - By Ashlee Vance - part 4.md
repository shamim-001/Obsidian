## Part 4: SolarCity and Musk’s Personal Life

Just before Tesla finished its very first prototype in early 2005, Musk and his cousin Lyndon went on a road trip to discuss business ventures. Musk had always believed clean energy is the key to human survival and a sustainable future, so when his cousin asked for business suggestions, Musk suggested he do something with solar power. Vance explains that at this time, the solar industry wasn’t making any effort to decrease the cost of solar panel manufacturing. Further, while consumers could install solar panels for their homes, they had no way of knowing if solar panels would work well for their homes based on location and how much sunlight they received.

(Shortform note: While the solar industry has made improvements in the past 20 years, experts have identified [four main obstacles the industry still needs to overcome](https://sciencebusiness.net/climate-news/news/future-solar-four-problems-we-need-solve-fast). First, find lower cost and more efficient materials to make the solar panels out of. Second, improve storage and transmission of solar power over long distances. Next, implement floating solar panels for lakes and oceans, while also preserving aquatic ecosystems. Finally, streamline the process of acquiring solar panels to make them more accessible for individuals and businesses—experts note that [government cooperation and regulation will be instrumental](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update/challenges-and-opportunities-beyond-2021) in overcoming this challenge.)

Thanks to Musk’s recommendation, his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rives started SolarCity, with Musk as the largest shareholder. Vance explains that the company made improvements on existing solar panels, offered installation packages, and gave consumers an understanding of how solar power would affect their individual homes. Eventually, the company expanded to big businesses like Intel and Wal-Mart. By 2014, SolarCity was worth $7 billion.

Since SolarCity and Tesla shared a similar goal of advancing alternative energy technologies, Musk’s companies provided mutual benefits to each other. When Musk announced that Tesla would expand its network of charging stations, he got SolarCity to supply these stations with solar panels. Tesla also shared its battery technology with SolarCity. Not only did Musk influence two major companies in the alternative energy industry, they are in a better position today to work together because of his involvement.

> **Does Musk Have a Conflict of Interest?**
> 
> While Vance presents Musk’s involvement in both SolarCity and Tesla as a smart business strategy, many experts contend that this is a [conflict of interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-of-interest.asp) because Musk owns significant shares in both companies and employs family members. Additionally, [SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock in March 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160330071152/http://investors.solarcity.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-16-15105&CIK=1408356).
> 
> To complicate matters, [Tesla bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion in August 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/solarcity-tesla-energy-beleaguered-history-elon-musk-2021-7), renaming it Tesla Energy. Some shareholders viewed this as a self-serving move—since Musk had a 22% stake in SolarCity at the time—and a bailout for SolarCity rather than a beneficial move for Tesla. After the merger, auditors found that [SolarCity didn’t have the necessary funds to continue as a stand-alone company](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-23/solarcity-tesla-merger-shareholder-lawsuit). Investors sued Musk, stating he’d hidden SolarCity’s financial problems from investors.
> 
> Experts estimate that the [lawsuit could cost him $13 billion if he loses the case](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/musk-engineered-solarcity-purchase-as-bailout-investors-argue). In the trial, Musk remained adamant that the acquisition was part of a larger plan to ensure Tesla’s future as a company committed to renewable energy.

### Personal Life

While Musk spent a lot of time and energy on his businesses, he also made time for his personal life, including dating, having children, and divorce.

In May 2002, Musk and his first wife, Justine, welcomed their first child, Nevada. When he was 10-weeks old, Nevada died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Musks were devastated. Musk confided in a few of his friends about his grief. But while Justine openly mourned, Musk didn’t think making his sadness public was productive. Instead, he turned his attention to the future and his companies.

(Shortform note: Some experts note that the [death of a child may result in lifelong mourning and grief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-grief/201808/five-common-myths-about-grief#:~:text=There%20really%20is%20no%20right%20or%20wrong,how%20you%20grieve%20and%20what%20you%20do%20to). Vance notes that Justine and Musk grieved differently after Nevada’s sudden death, and experts note that [there is no right or wrong way to grieve](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2015/03/10/7-dos-and-donts-for-staying-connected-as-a-couple-during-grief). But these differences can result in misunderstandings between partners. Instead, experts encourage people to respect others’ style of grief, whether it’s emotional, action-based, internalized, or a mix of everything.)

By 2008, Musk was devoting his time to Tesla’s production issues and SpaceX’s launch problems. He usually worked seven days a week, and as a result, he didn’t spend much time at home with his family. Justine was unhappy due to postpartum depression following the birth of their triplets in 2006, and she was dissatisfied with being treated like a trophy wife. Their relationship deteriorated until Musk filed for divorce.

The next month, Musk met a 22-year old actress named Talulah Riley, and they got married a few weeks later. Justine continued to post on her blog about the divorce and Musk’s new wife. This exacerbated the bad press surrounding Musk and his companies, which added to his stress. Musk and Riley later divorced, remarried, and divorced again.

(Shortform note: Musk’s turbulent marriages and [divorces](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-toughest-job-an-entrepreneur-has-is-to-keep-their_b_59b97a37e4b02c642e4a1352) highlight an important part of the entrepreneurial lifestyle—they may be [more prone to divorce than the US average](https://www.inc.com/rebecca-deczynski/dominos-customer-pickup-incentive-labor-shortage-staffing.html), which is already one of the highest in the world, for a number of reasons. First, entrepreneurs take risks, especially when it comes to finances—they’ll use their own money to back their ventures. But an entrepreneur often doesn’t understand how risk affects their spouse, who often doesn’t have as high of a risk tolerance. Another reason is that entrepreneurs usually devote the bulk of their time and energy to their business, rather than their spouse’s life or emotional needs, which can foster feelings of neglect or resentment in a spouse.)
