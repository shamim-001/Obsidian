## Chapters 9 & 10 : Building a Strong Team

Thiel points out that the decisions you make when founding an organization will permanently shape how it operates in the future. **You need to make the right decisions up front, because if you make mistakes at the formative stages of your startup, it may not be possible to fix them later.** Thiel calls this principle “Thiel’s law,” and says that it applies to organizations of all types, whether businesses or governments.

As an example of how difficult it is for established organizations to change, Thiel points out how seldom the Constitution of the United States has been amended. The organizational structure of the US government is much the same as it was two hundred years ago, and it’s not likely to be changed, whether it still suits our needs well or not.

### Choosing Partners

Thiel asserts that **one thing you need to get right up front is the selection of your co-founders. In fact, he asserts that this is the _most important_ decision you’ll make in founding a startup**.

He even equates choosing a co-founder to choosing a marriage partner, claiming that the same issue of personal compatibility applies, and the consequences of incompatibility are just as severe. As an example, he recounts the tragic story of a company founded by Luke Nosek and an unnamed co-founder whose personality and ambitions were incompatible with Nosek’s. Thiel was an investor in the company, but he lost his investment when the company failed due to the founders’ incompatibility.

#### Corporate Structure

The structure of your startup provides a framework to support and constrain how the people of the company—founders, investors, employees, and so on—interact with each other. As Thiel notes, some people advise against imposing structure on an organization, saying that this will stimulate creativity by giving your team members greater latitude to implement their own innovative ideas. Thiel concedes that in a perfect world, full of perfect people, that would be true, but argues that in the real world, real people need some amount of structure in order to work together constructively.

As an example of how lack of effective structure can contribute to poor performance, Thiel discusses the notoriously poor customer service of certain government agencies.

(Shortform note: On paper, most government agencies have a formal structure, but Thiel equates “structure” with clearly defined roles, and bureaucracy, by definition, is when responsibilities are distributed over such a large organization that no individual holds responsibility for anything. Thus, to Thiel, a bureaucracy’s lack of clearly defined roles implies a lack of effective structure.)

He explains that to establish a structure that will promote alignment and progress, you must make three decisions:

- **Equity:** Who will legally own the company? It’s not unusual for founders, investors, and employees all to have a share of ownership in a startup.
- **Direction:** Who will make the high-level decisions about what the company will do? In many startups, a board of directors consisting of the founders and investors fulfills this function.
- **Operation:** Who will figure out _how_ to accomplish the company’s high-level objectives and take responsibility for getting the work done? Sometimes a founder assumes this responsibility, sometimes the company hires a CEO to do it, and sometimes this function is distributed among employees.

##### **Minimizing Conflict**

Thiel explains that effective structure helps reduce conflict between different people with different interests, but doesn’t necessarily preclude it. In his experience, conflict in startups most often occurs between founders and investors on the board of directors. He advises keeping the size of the board small—preferably just three to five members—to make conflict easier to resolve by simplifying the logistics of communication.

### Recruiting Employees and Consultants

As you build your startup’s talent pool, **Thiel advises hiring only full-time, on-site employees**. He acknowledges that part-time employees, remote employees, and consultants paid as contractors are cheaper to hire, and that startups must generally operate on a tight budget. However, in his experience, the less intimately people are connected to the company, the more they tend to focus on looking good in the short term, rather than building the company’s future. As such, even if you have to hire consultants to get the necessary talent, bring them on as salaried employees rather than contractors. And don’t even bother with part-time help or remote hires.

#### Culture

Thiel says your **employees need to be unified by a zeal for your company’s unique mission**. By way of illustration, he says there’s a fine line between a successful startup and a cult: Usually, cults are built on an idea or ideology that’s wrong, but that their members zealously support. Successful startups are built on an idea that’s true, and that their employees are zealous about, but that the rest of the world thinks is wrong, because the truth of the idea is not yet widely known.

Thus, as you hire additional employees, Thiel emphasizes the importance of articulating your company’s mission to them. He advises hiring people who find your company’s unique mission compelling, and want to work with the kind of people who are already on your team—not people who are just looking for money or special perks.

Thiel advocates building the unity of your team by minimizing the factors that differentiate the members of the team from each other. For example, he recommends issuing uniforms to your employees, although he remarks that for most startups, a “uniform” would just be a T-shirt with the company logo on it. He also suggests hiring people who share the same interests, even on things outside the scope of work. The less your people differ from each other relative to how much they differ from the rest of the world, the stronger your team identity becomes.

However, he adds one caveat: As you minimize factors that differentiate your people from each other, _do not_ give them the same roles and responsibilities in the company. Returning to the subject of company structure, Thiel asserts that **every employee in your organization needs to have a unique and clearly defined role**. Overlapping roles and responsibilities lead to competition between employees, which, in turn, leads to inefficiencies that a startup simply cannot afford.

##### **The Pitfalls of Professionalism**

Thiel observes that some companies promote an atmosphere of “professionalism,” where you keep your work separate from the rest of your life. You limit your interactions with your coworkers to what’s necessary to get your work done. In theory, this produces a more cohesive workforce: All employees are unified by the company’s mission and they keep their personal lives out of their work so that differences in their beliefs, politics, or interests don’t cause disunity.

But Thiel sees this as a mistake. Instead, he argues that work should be a place to build lasting relationships. He recounts how the team he built at PayPal became so close that even after they went their separate ways people referred to them as the “PayPal Mafia.”

#### Compensation

Thiel cautions you not to overpay your CEO. In his view, paychecks motivate people only in the short term, because pay is derived from the _present_ value of the company, not its _future_ value. This can be especially problematic at the executive level, since it’s crucial to have a CEO with a vision for building the company’s future. Paying your CEO too much can undermine her motivation to do whatever it takes to reach the company’s long-term goals.

Additionally, the CEO pay sets the standard for the rest of the company: If she draws a fat paycheck, her subordinates will expect proportionally high compensation. If she covers up problems to make the current situation look better and thereby protect her short-term interests, her subordinates will do likewise. But if she addresses problems head-on and works for the company’s growth in the hope of _future_ rewards, this may inspire her subordinates to do the same.

Similarly, Thiel argues that offering employees high salaries or cash bonuses makes them more prone to focus on looking good in the short term rather than making the company prosper in the long term.

He says that it's better to reward employees with equity in the company, because it gives them a stake in the company’s future. However, he concedes that it is difficult to distribute equity in a way that seems fair to everyone. Typically, employees who start earlier get larger shares of equity. This is fair in the sense that these employees took a greater risk in joining the company, but it doesn’t necessarily scale with their contributions to the company’s success: the company’s first janitor might end up owning more stock than the engineering manager who was hired a few years later to scale up their production operations. He recommends keeping the allocation of equity confidential to prevent it from becoming a source of resentment between employees.
