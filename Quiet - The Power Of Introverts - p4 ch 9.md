## Part 4: Living and Working | Chapter 9: Fitting In

As noted in Chapter 5, whether you’re an introvert or extrovert, you have the ability to stretch your personality beyond your comfort zone and act in ways that don’t come naturally to you.

**Introverts, in particular, often act like extroverts in pursuit of goals they care about.** They succeed by using techniques such as self-monitoring and creating “restorative niches,” where they can take timeouts to recharge.

Some introverts become so good at acting out of character that the people around them have no idea how out of character they really are. For instance, Professor Brian Little, by nature an introvert, pushed so hard to act like an extrovert that he seemed to have a dual personality. Before he retired, he was a Harvard University psychology lecturer and acclaimed teacher/performer who was so popular with students that his classes were standing room only and often ended in ovations. He also was a popular speaker for a variety of organizations, including the military. However, in his “off” time, Little lived in a cabin in the woods of Canada, with few visitors other than family. He spent his time there reading and writing in solitude. Eventually, the “acting” led to burnout and now he focuses on research—among other things, studying how and why introverts often successfully masquerade as extroverts.

### Fixed and ‘Free’ Traits

A few psychologists—”situationists”—have argued that personality traits aren’t fixed—that we have various “selves” instead of a core personality and we shift or change our personality to suit the situation we find ourselves in.

However, Little believes we have fixed traits that remain fairly constant throughout our lives and profoundly influence us. Most psychologists, including Carl Jung and more recent researchers, agree with this view.

So how can many introverts act out of character so convincingly? Little argues that we have both fixed and “free” personality traits. **According to his “free trait theory,” we’re born with certain traits like introversion, but we can act out of character when pursuing “core personal projects” or goals that matter deeply to us**.

For instance, an introvert might join the PTA at his daughter’s school because his family is important to him. Similarly, Little could be a passionate teacher because sharing his excitement for his subject was a “core project” to him.

**You won’t succeed in acting out of character to advance a project you don’t care about**. However, introverts may have difficulty identifying their core personal projects because they’re used to ignoring their own preferences and feeling uncomfortable in many situations. For an introvert functioning in an extrovert-dominated world, it’s like spending time in a foreign country —it can be exciting, but you don’t feel like you fit in.

Here are three steps to help identify your core personal projects:

1. Consider the following: when asked as a child what you wanted to be one day, what was the impulse behind your answer—for example, wanting to be a firefighter because you wanted to help people in distress. Understanding what motivates you can help determine your core interests.
2. Notice the type of work you gravitate to—for example, within your job, do you prefer mentoring over negotiating new deals?
3. Notice what you envy—you often envy those who have what you want.

### Self-Monitoring

Researchers studied how introverts adapt their personalities by asking them to act like extroverts while teaching a class. The researchers measured such things as eye contact, confident posture, and smiling. **Researchers found that introverts who do the best job of acting like extroverts are skilled at self-monitoring.** To adjust their behavior to the social demands of a situation, they look for cues from others to tell them how to act.

Some people are better at self-monitoring than others. Little, like the best teachers, took cues from his student audiences—for instance, adjusting his lectures if the students weren’t following them. In contrast, “low” self-monitors are less sensitive to external cues and are instead guided internally by their interests and motivations.

You can gauge your self-monitoring skill level by answering questions from psychologist Mark Snyder’s Self-Monitoring Scale, for instance:

- In different situations, do you often act like different people?
- When you’re not sure how to act in social situations, do you look to others’ behavior for cues?
- Do you deceive people by being friendly with them when you actually dislike them?

The more often you answer yes to questions in the assessment, the more skilled a self-monitor you are.

While some may view self-monitoring and adjusting your behavior as being phony, Little views it as being accommodating to situations and people, rather than putting your own interests first.

### Creating a ‘Restorative Niche’

Even if you’re pursuing a core personal project, **you don’t want to act out of character for too long because it takes a lot of energy.**

In the process, **you need to create “restorative niches,” where you can relax and be yourself.** These niches can be a physical place—many introverts take a break in the bathroom after giving a speech or during a long social event. While giving a series of lectures to military officers, Little took a walk by himself between lectures, rather than having lunch with the top brass. You can also create restorative niches by giving yourself a relaxing weekend before a big event, taking breaks for yoga or meditation, or replacing a face-to-face meeting with a phone call or email.

You can even create a restorative, or at least a less stressful, niche during a meeting or event by choosing when you arrive, where you sit, and how you communicate. These choices help you establish physical distance and perspective.

**Before accepting a job, you might want to consider the availability of restorative niches** that fit your personality—for instance, would you have private work space or face the constant interruptions of an open office?

You also might ask yourself how much time the job would allow you to spend in-character. An extrovert might ask whether the job/environment would provide enough stimulation and contact with people. Sometimes you can re-engineer a job—for instance, getting permission to work remotely—so you’re acting in-character most of the time.

In your personal life, you might have to negotiate what Little calls a “Free Trait Agreement” with a spouse or partner, in which you each agree to act out of character on occasion, in exchange for being in-character most of the time. For instance, you’ll attend your wife’s best friend’s wedding, but you’ll skip the pre-wedding social activities.

You can even negotiate a Free Trait Agreement with yourself—for instance deciding the number of social events you’ll force yourself to attend in exchange for most evenings at home.
