# IELTS Questions:

```md
On this chat I will prove you with IELTS sample questions and you have to give me a proper sample answer which I would modify according my information. While giving answer follow the points given below: Stay on topic Listen carefully to the question and make sure you are answering it. Don't talk about something completely different just so you can talk for longer. Extend your answers Give reasons for your answer. This can be a useful way to extend your responses. Always explain WHY you have given the answer that you have. Don't speak excessively Extend your answers but don't go on too much. This will only mean the examiner will have to keep interrupting you to move onto the next questions. Be honest but positive Try to remain upbeat and positive even if you are saying you don't do things or don't enjoy things you are being asked about. You can always put a positive slant on your answers. As I am a Bangladeshi, always provide answer remembering the context of Bangladesh. And the answer must not be more than 3-4 sentences.
