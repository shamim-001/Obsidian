## 1-Page Summary

What if you could create your dream life through the power of thought? Roxie Nafousi explains that this practice, called manifesting, is achievable for anyone. However, there’s more to the manifestation process than meets the eye. While many people see manifesting as simply picturing the thing you desire and receiving it, Nafousi explains that **effective manifestation also requires you to fundamentally alter your mindset—your thoughts, behaviors, and emotions.** In _Manifest,_ Nafousi presents her method for adopting the mindset necessary to manifest and achieve anything you want in life.

Nafousi is a social media influencer turned self-development coach and author. She’s also an ambassador for the [Mental Health Foundation](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/). However, Nafousi claims that she didn’t always lead such a successful life—she previously struggled with mental health issues and addiction, feeling trapped in an unhealthy lifestyle that she didn’t know how to overcome. This all changed in 2018 when she discovered the concept of manifesting and began working toward her ideal life. She now regularly writes about self-development for publications such as [Marie Claire](https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/), [Female First](https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/), and [E! Online](https://www.eonline.com/). Her second book, _[Manifest: Dive Deeper](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/453105/manifest-dive-deeper-by-nafousi-roxie/9780241608005),_ elaborates on her methods in _Manifest_ and discusses how to harness your full potential and create lasting change.

This guide will explore the manifestation method that took Nafousi from her darkest moments to her ideal life within a few short years. First, we’ll explain what manifestation is and how it works. Then, we’ll discuss the five main principles that Nafousi claims are crucial for altering your mindset and manifesting the life of your dreams—creating a clear vision, loving yourself and practicing gratitude, overcoming negativity, matching your actions to your goals, and having faith.

Throughout this guide, we’ll supplement Nafousi’s arguments and recommendations with advice from other experts on finding success, such as Rhonda Byrne (_[The Secret](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret))_, Brianna Wiest (_[The Mountain Is You](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-mountain-is-you))_, and Daniel Walter (_[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline))._ We’ll also examine some of the scientific discussion around manifestation.

### What Is Manifestation and How Does It Work?

**Nafousi defines manifesting as the process of attracting what you want in life using a positive mindset—a combination of positive thoughts, behaviors, and emotions.** Manifestation is based on the _Law of Attraction_, which states that the energy we put out into the world attracts similar energy back to us. In other words, a _positive_ mindset will attract positivity into our lives and propel us toward our goals, while a _negative_ mindset will attract negativity into our lives and prevent us from reaching our goals. So, to manifest the life of your dreams and become the best version of yourself, you must adopt a positive mindset—everything you think, do, and feel must attract the life that you desire.

(Shortform note: Since the mid-2000s, the term “manifest” has been redefined by popular culture and the spiritual community, and in large part, by Rhonda Byne in her book _[The Secret](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret)._ While Nafousi defines manifesting as the process of attracting what you _want_ in life through positive belief—in other words, deliberately using only the _positive_ side of the Law of Attraction—Byrne defines manifesting as the _intentional or unintentional_ process of attracting whatever you think about, good or bad. In this guide, [the verb manifest means “the process of bringing something tangible into your life through positive thinking and belief](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a30244004/how-to-manifest-anything/)_._”)

**The Law of Attraction is based on quantum physics**—everything in the universe is made up of atoms that vibrate at different frequencies, and atoms with similar frequencies attract each other. Nafousi argues that thoughts, behaviors, and emotions all impact the vibrational frequency that we emit—a positive mindset causes us to emit high vibrations that attract high vibrations in return, while a negative mindset causes us to emit low vibrations that attract more low vibrations.

> **Can Positive Thoughts and Emotions Alter Your Vibrational Frequency?**
> 
> Numerous mind coaches and spiritual teachers have used The Law of Attraction to justify the process of manifesting. They claim that positive thoughts lead to high vibrational frequencies that attract positivity. However, there’s no credible scientific research proving that thoughts and emotions are linked to vibrational frequencies, nor that frequencies are “positive” or “negative.”
> 
> Health experts elaborate that [there are many different vibrations that occur inside the body](https://www.healthline.com/health/vibrational-energy#what-we-know)—large-scale vibrations (rhythms) like your heartbeat, breathing rate, and circadian rhythms, and small-scale nano vibrations that occur on the molecular level (the ones that impact your vibrational frequency).
> 
> Your thoughts and emotions _can_ alter large-scale vibrations—for example, your heartbeat will increase when you’re anxious. But large-scale vibrations won’t impact your body’s vibrational frequency. Further, [the molecular-level nano vibrations that can alter your body’s vibrational frequency are unmeasurable](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1721498115), and there’s no evidence yet for _how_ or _if_ thoughts and emotions can alter them.
> 
> So while the process of manifesting positivity by emitting positive energy may _make sense_ based on what we currently understand about quantum physics, there’s not yet scientific evidence _supporting_ this theorized phenomenon.

In the following sections, we’ll discuss the top five principles that Nafousi says will help you develop a positive mindset and manifest the life of your dreams.

### Principle #1: Create a Detailed Mental Image of Your Desires

**Nafousi argues that the first principle of manifesting is to create a clear, detailed mental image of what you want**. This step (what Nafousi calls “visualizing”) is crucial to manifesting because our brains respond to mental images as if they were real. In other words, imagining exactly what you want will trick your brain into believing that you already have it. You’ll then experience positive emotions and emit high vibrations that will actually attract that thing into your life.

(Shortform note: Rhonda Byrne popularized visualization in _[The Secret](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret)._ She explains, like Nafousi, that the process helps attract your desires due to your brain responding as if your visualizations were reality. While Nafousi doesn’t offer any scientific evidence to support this assertion, Byrne explains that [scientists observed this effect when conducting tests on Olympians](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret/chapter-7#visualization). When these athletes visualized performing their events, their brains sent signals to their bodies as if the event were actually happening, and their muscles responded as if they were in action.)

#### The Process of Creating a Clear Mental Image

To create a clear mental image of what you want, Nafousi recommends following a few steps.

**First, include as many details as you can about your desire.** For example, if you want to move to a neighborhood near the beach in a foreign country, start by imagining the details of this neighborhood—how far apart are the houses? Are there children playing outside? Is it grassy? Can you see the ocean?

**Next, Nafousi argues, imagine how you’ll feel once you’ve achieved your desire.** For example, you may feel anticipation to meet up with your new friends, peaceful to be in your sunny new home, grateful to have the ocean right outside, and loved because you’re surrounded by positive people. Focus on these emotions and try to feel them.

(Shortform note: In _[The Miracle Morning](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-miracle-morning),_ Hal Elrod presents a similar method for visualization, explaining that you must be detailed about your desires and imagine yourself achieving them. However, while Nafousi mainly recommends including sight- and emotion-based details in your vision, [Elrod recommends imagining all of your senses](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-miracle-morning/chapter-7#3-steps-for-visualization)—sight, touch, taste, smell, hearing, and feeling—to get the best manifestation results. For example, not only should you imagine details like what the neighborhood looks like, who lives there, and how you feel there, but you should also consider things like how the grass feels under your toes, the smell of the sea air, the sound of the ocean, and so on.)

**Then, Nafousi recommends, identify how this future version of yourself differs from who you are now.** How do they think, feel and act? What habits do they have? What are their relationships like? How do they handle difficult situations? And so on. For example, maybe future you lives with their partner, starts their day with yoga every morning, gets to work by 8 a.m., and enjoys an hour of self-care before bed each night.

(Shortform note: In _[The Secret](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret),_ Rhonda Byrne also recommends identifying differences between your future self and your current self so you know what to strive for. However, she adds an additional recommendation that will help your desired future and future self to materialize: [Act as if your desires for the future have already happened](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret/chapter-7#act-as-if). For example, if your future self lives with their spouse and attends morning yoga classes, make an extra key and create closet space for your future spouse, and clear your morning schedule so you can attend a yoga class when you find one. These actions show that you truly believe in your ability to manifest—therefore, they’ll emit positivity and attract your desires even faster.)

##### Use Meditation to Create Your Mental Images

Nafousi recommends rehearsing the above process through meditation. Every few days, sit down for 10 to 15 minutes in a quiet, peaceful place and rehearse the previous steps to create a detailed imagining of what you want to manifest.

(Shortform note: While Nafousi recommends meditating on your visualizations every few days for 10 to 15 minutes, in _[The Secret](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret/),_ Rhonda Byrne [suggests performing daily meditations](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-secret/chapter-6#awareness). These meditations can last anywhere from three to 10 minutes to begin with, and you can increase their length over time. Byrne notes that not only will frequent meditation help you manifest your visions, but it’ll also help you gain control over your thoughts and emotions. This emotional control will allow you to regularly maintain positive thoughts and emotions that attract positivity while avoiding negative thoughts and emotions that attract negativity.)

### Principle #2: Show Yourself Love and Practice Gratitude

**Nafousi explains that the second principle of manifesting is to show yourself love (what she calls “self-love”) and practice gratitude**—these are the two cornerstones of a positive mindset. These practices will raise your vibrations to the highest possible level (which will attract positive, high vibrations back to you), and they’ll also help you resist negative thoughts and actions that can lower your vibrations and sabotage your positive manifestation.

(Shortform note: Rhonda Byrne’s central argument in _[The Power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power)_ seems to support Nafousi’s emphasis on the importance of self-love and gratitude. Byrne explains that [feeling and expressing love is the most powerful way to attract positivity because it’s a purely positive, invisible force](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power/chapter-1#everything-is-love)—when you incorporate love into your daily life, everything you think, do, and feel will be charged with positive energy. Byrne elaborates that practicing self-love (loving your life and who you are) is important for _feeling love internally_, while [gratitude is the most powerful way to express love externally](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power/chapter-5#key-2-gratitude)_._ These forms of love, practiced together, are the best way to facilitate other positive emotions, resist negativity, and attract positivity like a magnet.)

In the following sections, we’ll explain what it means to love yourself and practice gratitude, and we’ll discuss Nafousi’s technique for cultivating these two abilities.

#### What Does It Mean to Love Yourself?

Nafousi notes that to love yourself is to believe that you’re worthy and capable of achieving anything you want in life. Loving yourself requires you to act in your best interest, overcome negative self-perceptions, forgive yourself for flaws and mistakes, and fully embrace who you are.

**Loving yourself is the most vital ingredient of successful manifestation** because it fosters the belief that you can accomplish, and deserve, all your desires in life. This belief combats all forms of negativity, such as the fear of failure or self-doubt. If you don’t love yourself, these negative thoughts, behaviors, and perspectives will lower your vibration and hinder your progress toward positive manifestation.

> **What Is Self-Love and Why Is It Important?**
> 
> In _[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection),_ Brené Brown reiterates the importance of acting in your best interest, overcoming negative self-perceptions, forgiving yourself for flaws and mistakes, and fully embracing who you are. However, while Nafousi refers to this concept as “practicing self-love,” [Brown refers to it as practicing worthiness](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-1#defining-worthiness). Further, Brown explains that there are three values you must practice to cultivate worthiness:
> 
> - _[Ordinary courage is the ability to express your authentic self, feelings, and experiences without feeling ashamed](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-1#courage)_ (fully embrace who you are and overcome negative self-perceptions).
>     
> - _[Compassion is the ability to use bravery, vulnerability, and acceptance to be kind to yourself and others](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-1#compassion)_ (act in your best interest and forgive yourself for flaws and mistakes).
>     
> - _[Connection is building meaningful and fulfilling relationships with others](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-1#connection)_.
>     
> 
> While Nafousi argues that self-love helps you achieve success and fulfillment in life by _boosting your ability to manifest_, Brown argues that [practicing worthiness breeds success and happiness because it helps you overcome feelings of shame](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/chapter-3). Brown elaborates that shame is the ultimate foil to living a happy, fulfilling life because it thrives on and encourages fear, self-hatred, and the feeling that you’re not “enough,” and you can’t flourish in these conditions. Similarly, Nafousi might assert that it would be nearly impossible to manifest with these negative thoughts and emotions present in your life.

##### How to Cultivate Love for Yourself

Nafousi makes two main recommendations for regularly cultivating love for yourself.

**First, be conscious of your actions and their impacts.** Pay attention to the choices you’re making in life and whether those choices are in your best interest. If they’re continually causing you distress or unhappiness, or they’re hindering your progress toward your goals, identify what you can do instead to cultivate more positivity—show yourself love by doing what’s best for you. For example, if you realize that hanging out with a certain friend always makes you feel grouchy, acknowledge that this friend might not be a good match.

(Shortfom note: In _[The Mountain Is You](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-mountain-is-you),_ Brianna Wiest explains that becoming conscious of your self-sabotaging actions—those that work against your best interest—is especially difficult because they tend to be subconscious behaviors. To help identify self-sabotaging behaviors that are possibly slipping under your radar, [Wiest recommends first identifying everything in your life that you’re unhappy with or want to change](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-mountain-is-you/1-page-summary#step-1-identify-your-self-sabotaging-behaviors-and-their-root-causes). Then, create a list of the behaviors that are perpetuating that unhappiness or preventing you from making those changes—these are the self-sabotaging behaviors you must overcome to achieve your ideal life and achieve happiness.)

**Second, accept your current state.** Each day, acknowledge how you’re doing—mentally, physically, and emotionally—and do what you can to help yourself if you’re not feeling great. If this means staying in bed and drinking tea all day, then do so. If this means forcing yourself out of bed and going on a run to clear your mind, then do that. Loving yourself means caring for yourself in whatever way you need right now.

If you push yourself to do too much when you’re not feeling good, you’ll self-criticize and feel guilty when you inevitably run out of energy and can’t achieve what you want. This will only attract negativity into your life.

(Shortform note: In _[Codependent No More](https://shortform.com/app/book/codependent-no-more),_ Melody Beattie reiterates [the importance of being attentive to your inner state and giving yourself the grace and care you need,](https://shortform.com/app/book/codependent-no-more/part-2#what-is-self-care) and she refers to this concept as self-care. However, Beattie warns that people sometimes abuse “self-care” and use it as an excuse to work against their best interests or neglect responsibilities. For example, skipping work to sleep in because you were tired _isn’t_ an appropriate way to practice Nafousi and Beattie’s recommendation—it’s an excuse to neglect your responsibilities. While it’s important not to push yourself too hard and burn yourself out, as Nafousi explains, you must also differentiate _needs_ (like resting when you’re _ill_) from _wants_ (like sleeping in).)

#### What Does It Mean to Practice Gratitude?

**Nafousi explains that gratitude is a crucial element of a positive mindset because it’s one of the highest-vibrational feelings**. Gratitude works as a positivity magnet—when we express our gratitude for the things we already have in life, the universe matches that vibration by sending us more things to be grateful for.

However, Nafousi warns to be careful when expressing gratitude—focus _only_ on what you’re grateful for _without_ using “buts” (what Nafousi calls “caveats”). For example, don’t say “I’m grateful for my partner _but_ I wish they would clean more”—this expresses gratitude and _lack_ in the same expression. When you express gratitude along with something you _lack,_ the negative vibrations of lack cancel out the positive vibrations of gratitude and get you nowhere.

(Shorform note: In _[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection),_ Brené Brown also emphasizes the importance of practicing gratitude. However, rather than seeing gratitude specifically as a tool to enhance manifestation, Brown frames it as important to [generally feeling worthy, fulfilled, and happy in life](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/chapters-7-10-12-13#practice-gratitude-and-feel-joy). She elaborates that some people struggle to express gratitude because [this practice goes hand in hand with fear that you’ll lose the things you’re grateful for](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/chapters-7-10-12-13#a-barrier-to-gratitude-fear). Rather than experience this vulnerability, people would rather avoid gratitude altogether. This could arguably explain why people express gratitude with “buts”—to avoid the vulnerability that true gratitude promotes.)

##### How to Cultivate Gratitude

Nafousi makes three recommendations for cultivating gratitude and practicing it in your daily life.

**First, keep a gratitude journal.** Each day, chronologically record everything you experience that you’re grateful for. For example, as you progress through your day, you might write “I’m grateful to have a coffee machine in my home,” “I’m grateful for the comfortable pair of shoes I walk to work in,” “I’m grateful for the rain that watered my flowers while I was at work,” and so on. You’ll develop a positive perspective by becoming more aware of all the things you should be grateful for on a daily basis.

**Second, use gratitude to respond to negative feelings.** Whenever you start to feel down—unlucky, unworthy, sad, and so on—list things that you’re grateful for. You’ll overcome negative thoughts and feelings and replace them with positivity.

**Third, focus on the present moment.** Many people get caught up in negative emotions contrary to gratitude, like anxiety or dread, because they’re focused on the past or future rather than the present. For example, you might be feeling anxious and regretful over something silly you said five minutes ago rather than listening to your child tell you how much they love you.

To cultivate gratitude _and_ avoid the thoughts and emotions that contradict it, Nafousi recommends focusing on and being thankful for the present moment—express gratitude for the sights, sounds, and emotions that the _present moment_ evokes and for the people you’re _currently_ with.

> **How to Practice Gratitude**
> 
> In _[Seeking Wisdom](https://shortform.com/app/book/seeking-wisdom),_ Julia Cameron explains that expressing gratitude is one of the best ways to reach your creative potential and manifest positivity. However, she [makes a few additional recommendations](https://shortform.com/app/book/seeking-wisdom#prayers-of-appreciation) that might make this concept more actionable and more applicable to people of different faiths and beliefs.
> 
> First, Cameron recommends expressing gratitude through prayer. This prayer can be sent out to whatever higher power you believe in, whether that be Allah, God, the Universe, the Matrix, or anything else. Praying on your gratitude increases your belief in the innate goodness of the universe, which will return more goodness back to you.
> 
> Next, Cameron makes a few recommendations on _what_ to express gratitude for through prayer and _how_ to do it. She notes that a good starting point is to express gratitude for _the beauty of nature_—the bright green of the grass, the coolness of the wind, the sound of rivers, and so on. Cameron says that the natural landscape tends to evoke a state of awe, which is a natural pathway into gratitude. She further explains that this method helps you to stay mindful, or connected to the present moment, as Nafousi recommends in her third suggestion.
> 
> Cameron also recommends using prayer to express gratitude for _the people in your life_—both those you’re close to, such as your partner, and those you're not, such as the cashier at the grocery store. She explains that a higher power sends people into your life for a reason, so reflecting on what you can learn from these people and being grateful for their presence will help attract more people into your life that will guide you toward your destined path. You can use this as a topic for Nafousi’s first and second suggestion—you can write about the people you’re grateful for in your gratitude journal and focus on those you're grateful for to replace negative emotions.
> 
> Finally, use prayer to express gratitude for _miraculous events_—like getting caught in a red light that saved you from a car crash in the intersection ahead—and _moments of serendipity_—like bumping into a nice yoga instructor at the grocery store the same week you start looking for a yoga class. These experiences are gifts sent by a higher power, and expressing gratitude for them will attract more gifts into your life. You can use gifts as a topic for Nafousi’s first and second suggestions—you can write about the events you’re grateful for in your gratitude journal and focus on them to replace negative emotions.

### Principle #3: Overcome Negativity

While loving yourself and practicing gratitude are ways to _prevent_ negativity, Nafousi argues that you should also develop a few techniques that will **_target and eradicate_** negative thoughts and emotions when they make it past your firewall. She recommends three main techniques for doing so.

#### Technique #1: Quell Negative Thoughts and Emotions With Positive Affirmations

**Nafousi argues that one of the best ways to overcome negative thoughts and emotions when they arise is by reciting positive affirmations**—statements that encourage positive beliefs.

To create positive affirmations, listen to the limiting beliefs of your inner voice and craft affirmations that state the opposite. For example, if your inner voice is telling you that you’re not good enough, your positive affirmation can be something like “I’m worthy and capable of achieving anything that I dedicate myself to.”

When you notice your inner voice reciting negative thoughts, choose to actively drown them out by reciting positive affirmations _in your mind._ Nafousi notes that this will override your negative inner voice and stop it from bringing down your vibration.

Further, Nafousi recommends reciting positive affirmations _aloud_ and integrating this practice into your daily routine. For example, every morning on the way to work, you could recite your list of affirmations: “Today is going to be an amazing day where I maximize my productivity,” “I’m a beautiful and unique person inside and out,” “I’m capable of achieving anything I dedicate myself to,” and so on.

These positive affirmations don’t _only_ have to combat your negative inner voice: They can pertain to any area in which you want to improve your confidence. Reciting these affirmations regularly will start to alter your beliefs little by little until the positive statements become personal truths and entirely replace your more negative beliefs.

> **The Impact of Positive Affirmations and How to Get the Most From Them**
> 
> While reciting positive affirmations to yourself, in your head or out loud, may feel awkward or uncomfortable at first, numerous studies support Nafousi’s claim that doing so can change your mindset and help you overcome negative thoughts and feelings.
> 
> First, Psychological studies have suggested that [reciting positive affirmations increases certain neural pathways that facilitate positive thoughts about yourself and introspective reflection](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/). In other words, reciting positive affirmations can fundamentally alter your brain so that you’re more likely to interpret information in a way that benefits you and less likely to react to it negatively. This leads to decreased stress and negative rumination, improved behavior, and a more positive outlook on life.
> 
> Further, in 1994 and again in 2005, researcher Masaru Emoto found that [reciting positive affirmations at frozen water made the molecules form more beautiful crystalline structures](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/mindfulness-matters-dr-emoto-studies-reveal-power-of-positive-emotion-012914) than water that didn’t receive positive affirmations. This is significant because the human body is 70% water—Emoto believes that these observations are proof that positive affirmations can alter the very nature of our bodies.
> 
> While Nafousi recommends both reciting your affirmations aloud and in your mind, some experts believe that [vocalizing your affirmations aloud is the most impactful method for creating a positive mindset and overcoming negativity](https://brainhackerexpert.com/do-you-have-to-say-affirmations-out-loud/). Further, they recommend a few specific affirmations depending on your circumstances—there are affirmations specifically designed for [women](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/#:~:text=9%20Positive%20Affirmations%20for%20Women), for [men](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/#:~:text=9%20Positive%20Affirmations%20for%20Men), for [teens](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/#:~:text=15%20Positive%20Affirmations%20for%20Teens), for [kids](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/#:~:text=11%20Positive%20Affirmations%20for%20Kids), for those struggling with [anxiety](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/#:~:text=9%20Positive%20Affirmations%20to%20Help%20Relieve%20Anxiety) and [depression](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/#:~:text=5%20Daily%20Affirmations%20for%20Depression), and so on. Incorporating these _personalized_ affirmations into your routine will likely increase their impact on you.

#### Technique #2: Turn Jealousy Into Motivation

A second way to overcome negativity is to combat jealousy. **Nafousi argues that jealousy is one of the lowest-vibration emotions that people commonly experience**. When we see that another person has something that we want, we develop negative feelings toward them and ourselves. We feel resentment toward them because we think they’re better than us, and we feel bad about ourselves because we believe that we’re unworthy or undeserving of gaining what the other person has.

While these responses are natural, they push us _farther away_ from gaining the object of our desire because they cause us to emit low vibrations and attract negativity. **To overcome the corrupting effect of jealousy, Nafousi argues that we should channel the emotion into positive motivation**—feel happy that another person is experiencing joy and reaching their goals, and channel this emotion into a desire to improve yourself and achieve _your_ goals.

For example, if you see someone on social media posting about their lovely trip, rather than feeling jealous of them and angry at yourself for not being on vacation, be happy that they’re having a great experience and start working toward your own dream trip.

> **How to Turn Negative (Low-Vibration) Emotions Into Positive Future Actions**
> 
> In _[The Mountain Is You](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-mountain-is-you),_ Brianna Wiest reiterates that negative emotions like jealousy push us farther away from our goals and ideal life. Like Nafousi, she believes that rather than letting these emotions control us, we should use them as fuel for positive thoughts, feelings, and future actions. However, Wiest argues that these emotions prevent us from reaching our ideal life and full potential _not_ because they attract low vibrations, as Nafousi suggests, but because they trigger self-sabotaging behaviors. For example, feeling jealous of someone might trigger the self-sabotaging behavior of wallowing in self-pity, which leads to inaction and prevents us from making progress toward our goals.
> 
> Further, Wiest argues that jealousy isn’t the only negative emotion that prevents us from achieving our ideal life—other negative emotions like anger, embarrassment, resentment, and regret are just as bad. However, if we know how to interpret the meanings behind these feelings, we can use them as fuel for positive future actions that will _move_ us closer to our ideal life:
> 
> - **Anger** indicates what’s important to you and is a sign that it’s time for you to take action toward positive change. For example, rather than wallowing in anger over someone talking down to you, take it as a sign to stand up for yourself and insist that they treat you with respect.
>     
> - **Embarrassment** indicates that you aren’t proud of your actions. Rather than wallowing in the feeling, use it as a sign to change your behavior in the future and act in a way you’re proud of.
>     
> - **Resentment** indicates that someone disappointed you. Rather than continuing to feel resentment, take this emotion as a sign to either adjust your expectations so they’re more realistic or have a conversation with the other person to make your expectations clear.
>     
> - **Regret** indicates that you didn’t do something you wish you’d done. Rather than wallowing, use this emotion as a guide for the actions you should take in the future.
>     

### Principle #4: Take Action Toward Your Goals

One of the biggest misconceptions about manifesting is that positive thoughts and emotions are all you need to materialize your desires. Nafousi explains that in reality, **you must also alter your _behaviors_ so that they help you make progress on your goals**. If your _actions_ don’t align with your _desires_, you’ll never make progress.

(Shortform note: In _[The 12 Week Year](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-12-week-year),_ Brian P. Moran agrees that your current actions are what create your future. To ensure that your actions are helping you make progress on your goals, he specifically recommends [creating a system of weekly plans and reviews](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-12-week-year/chapter-4): Before the week starts, plan out what you’ll accomplish each day of the week and check your plan daily to ensure you’re staying on schedule. At the end of the week, review your plan to ensure you’ve accomplished everything and that you’re making progress toward your goals.)

There are two main ways to match your actions to your goals: stepping out of your comfort zone and creating good habits.

#### Technique #1: Step Out of Your Comfort Zone

Nafousi explains that changing your behavior to make progress toward your goals can be difficult because you’re often forced to do new or challenging things that make you uncomfortable. **To make this process easier, she recommends regularly stepping out of your comfort zone** so you get familiar with the feeling of discomfort. You’ll realize that you’re more capable than you think and that hard, scary tasks aren’t actually as hard and scary as you thought.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline),_ Daniel Walter agrees that stepping out of your comfort zone and getting familiar with discomfort is necessary to make progress toward your goals. He adds that [humans have a natural tendency to resist this process for three specific reasons](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/1-page-summary#tendency-1-craving-consistency): 1) We’re afraid that trying something new will cause us to lose something valuable that we already have; 2) We’re afraid of failing and regretting our decision to change; and 3) The longer we experience something, the more comfortable and enjoyable it becomes and the less willing we are to give it up.)

Nafousi provides a few recommendations for making the most of your experience outside your comfort zone:

**1. Set intentions.** When you’re preparing to do something uncomfortable, be clear on _why_ you’re doing it. This will keep you focused and help you push through the discomfort of the experience.

**2. Expose your excuses.** When you’re afraid to do something, your mind will always provide excuses to justify _not_ doing it. When these excuses pop into your head, immediately debunk them by coming up with reasons and ways _to do_ the task.

**3. Persevere through barriers.** You’ll always face obstacles when you try something new—this is an inevitable part of the process. If you allow these barriers to stop you, you’re simply using them as an excuse to give up. Pushing through will help you build your self-worth, self-confidence, and resilience in difficult situations.

**4. Jump in headfirst.** When you’re about to step out of your comfort zone, you’ll often experience a flood of limiting beliefs that tell you you’re not good enough and encourage you to give up. Rather than letting these thoughts paralyze you, take a brief moment to collect yourself and then take action. For example, if you’re about to raise your hand in class but get nervous, take a deep breath and do it anyway.

> **How to Step Outside Your Comfort Zone**
> 
> Nafousi’s recommendations aim to prepare you to step outside of your comfort zone with a positive mindset. Experts reiterate many of her points, but they add [a few additional recommendations](https://www.betterup.com/blog/comfort-zone#:~:text=life%20you%20want.-,Steps%20to%20getting%20out%20of%20your%20comfort%20zone,-Here%20are%20six) that will help you feel _fully prepared_ to step out of your comfort zone and execute the process correctly. By using these tips in combination with Nafousi’s, you can avoid being overwhelmed or stricken with fear and can make the most of the experience.
> 
> **1) Before taking action, take a moment to identify exactly what’s inside and outside of your comfort zone**. This will ensure that you’re doing things that actually make you uncomfortable and help you make progress toward your goals, not just things that are unfamiliar but comfortable.
> 
> **2) Set SMART goals for your experience**. While Nafousi recommends setting general intentions for your experience, experts say that using the SMART goal system is an _especially_ effective method to ensure you get the most from it. SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. This goal-setting system is highly effective because its specificity allows you to track your progress and clearly identify when you’ve reached your objective.
> 
> **3) Take _small steps_ at first.** Taking small steps will make it easier to get started and jump in headfirst because you’ll feel more comfortable and less fearful than you would if you tried to take on a huge challenge all at once. Starting small will also gradually build your confidence and tolerance for discomfort, making it easier for you to persevere through barriers.
> 
> **4) Cultivate a positive mindset**—have compassion for yourself, frame challenges as opportunities, set ambitious goals, see failures as lessons, and challenge your underlying negative beliefs. Following these steps prevents negativity and uncertainty from halting your progress. As such, this tip will help you expose your excuses and push through barriers by giving you a positive, accurate, and motivated perspective.

#### Technique #2: Create Good Habits

Nafousi argues that **truly altering your behaviors so you make progress on your goals requires you to take action _daily_**. One of the best ways to do this is by creating positive habits—activities that are ingrained into your daily schedule.

**To create positive habits, identify _what you want_ and _who you want to be_**. Then, identify the daily activities that will help you make these factors your reality.

For example, imagine that _what you want_ is an expensive tropical vacation. You might practice the following habits to make this a reality: adding leftover money to a change jar at the end of each day, making your coffee at home rather than buying Starbucks, or researching some aspect of your trip like accommodations or activities for a few minutes each day.

Similarly, imagine that _who you want to be_ is a good parent. You might practice the following habits to make this a reality: packing your child’s lunch every night so you don’t forget in the morning, letting your child pick their own outfits, or using consequences rather than spanking to correct behavior.

> **Create Habits to Change Your Life**
> 
> In _[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline),_ Daniel Walter emphasizes the importance of creating good daily habits that help you make progress on your goals. Like Nafousi, [he recommends forming habits that serve as a plan of action for achieving your goals](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline#habit-2-create-plans-to-achieve-your-goals); however, this is just one of many types of habits that Walter recommends. To ensure that you maximize your productivity in every area of your life and make the _most_ progress toward your goals, Walter recommends implementing a few additional daily habits:
> 
> **[Regularly follow morning and evening routines](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline#habit-1-create-morning-and-evening-routines)**—set activities that you diligently perform immediately after waking up and before going to bed. Creating a productive morning routine sets the stage for continued productivity throughout the day. A productive evening routine ensures you get proper rest and feel fully prepared to make the most of the following day.
> 
> **[Control your impulses](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline#habit-3-gain-control-over-your-impulses).** Walter explains that humans have a natural impulse to opt for instant gratification, like giving up on a hard task or something productive and choosing to do something fun, like play video games, instead. When we let these impulses control us, we struggle to perform the hard, productive tasks necessary to progressing toward our goals. To overcome these impulses, Walter recommends always pushing yourself 60% harder when you're ready to give up. He also suggests waiting 10 minutes before making an unproductive decision when you get the urge to do so, as after the 10 minutes, the impulse will likely fade. Practicing these techniques regularly will turn them into habits that combat your impulses.
> 
> **[Form positive associations with work](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline#habit-7-create-positive-associations).** Walter explains that people often dread putting in the work necessary to achieve their goals because they have negative associations with work—for example, they don’t want to work because they associate it with being hard or boring. To overcome this and make work enjoyable, make it a habit to form positive associations with work. Do this by adding things you enjoy into your work routine—before, during, and after work. For example, make a nice cup of tea before you start work, listen to soothing music while you’re working, and cook your favorite meal after you finish—these actions will make the process enjoyable, or at least tolerable, from start to finish.

### Principle # 5: Have Faith

Nafousi argues that having faith in the process is one of the most crucial principles for successful manifestation. This is because **your _beliefs_ about reality _shape_ your reality.** If you don’t fully believe in the process of manifestation—that the universe will return the positive vibrations that you emit—then none of the previous principles will work to attract your desires.

Having faith in the manifestation process requires you to **believe that everything in life happens when and how it’s _meant to_, and that everything is leading you toward a higher purpose**. Nafousi explains that the manifestation process isn’t a smooth and straight path to your desires. You’ll face obstacles and surprises along the way, but you must maintain your belief that things will fall into place, you’ll reach the end of the path, and you’ll achieve your desires.

(Shortform note: Nafousi argues that having faith—trusting that the universe will reward your positive efforts when and how it’s meant to happen—is the final puzzle piece for _effective manifestation_ specifically. However, experts explain that having faith—not just in the universe, but in humanity, yourself, your values, your loved ones, and so on—[is an important component of living a happy life in general and building resilience against trauma and negativity](https://web.archive.org/web/20221205054311/https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-pain-of-losing-your-faith). _Without_ faith, you’re likely to feel lost or directionless in life, doubt your abilities and past decisions, and feel doubtful or foolish about your beliefs. Ultimately, losing your faith will make you feel unhappy, which, as a low-vibration emotion, will sabotage the manifestation process.)

Nafousi makes two main recommendations for staying on course and keeping the faith:

**1. Don’t settle.** When we find something _close_ to our desire, we often trick ourselves into thinking it’s our best option. Nafousi argues that this is a test of the universe—if you give up and settle, you’ll never reach your highest potential. Don’t stop working toward your goal until you’ve achieved _everything_ you desire—“good enough” is _not_ enough.

**2. Overcome disappointment by finding the silver lining.** Everything happens for a reason, so find that reason. For example, maybe your relationship didn’t work out because you need independence to become the highest, most confident version of yourself.

> **The Downsides of Having Faith**
> 
> Is it healthy to follow Nafousi’s recommendations here and _always_ have faith that things will work out for the best? Other experts and psychologists suggest not.
> 
> If you follow Nafousi’s first recommendation to avoid settling and instead keep the faith that something better will come along, [you might take extraordinary opportunities for granted and reject them because you’re waiting for something perfect that doesn’t exist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-good-enough-life/202111/is-settling-always-bad#:~:text=Settling%20is%20usually%20defined%20by,acknowledging%20the%20value%20and%20benefits). For example, you might end a positive and loving relationship because you think your _perfect_ partner is a painter while your current partner is a writer, and you have faith you’ll find your painter eventually. However, in reality, you might be squandering a relationship with an amazing person who makes you feel happy and fulfilled because you’re waiting for something “better.”
> 
> Similarly, if you follow Nafousi’s second recommendation to find the silver lining in everything and have faith that things will always work out for the best, [you might develop an unrealistically positive view of reality](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-optimism-bias-2795031#:~:text=Optimism%20bias%20increases%20the%20belief,re%20not%20worried%20about%20risks). This phenomenon, called the “optimism bias,” may trigger inappropriate responses to dangerous or sensitive situations and ultimately harm yourself or others. For example, you might remain passive in a dangerous situation like an oncoming hurricane, thinking everything will work out fine due to your faith in the universe. In reality, you must take measures to protect yourself and your loved ones.
> 
> Ultimately, having faith and staying positive arguably aren’t _entirely_ bad or harmful practices—just make sure that you’re being realistic and not following your faith blindly.
