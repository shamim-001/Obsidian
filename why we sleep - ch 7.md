# Why We Sleep

## Chapter 7: How Sleep Deprivation Harms the Brain

While getting great sleep is good for the brain, sleep deprivation is unambiguously harmful for the brain. Walker discusses three ways sleep deprivation is damaging: it worsens attention, worsens emotion control, and contributes to Alzheimer’s Disease.

### Sleep Deprivation Worsens Attention and Concentration

Walker notes that sleep deficits—the difference between the amount of sleep you _need_ and the amount you actually _get_—are very bad for attention and concentration. They add up over time, and performance progressively worsens with greater sleep deficit. Having 10 six-hour nights of sleep is equal in damage to one all-nighter, as is six four-hour nights of sleep.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that it takes [four days to make up for one hour of sleep debt](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27775095/), and sleeping in on the weekend doesn’t make up for it, especially if it’s a chronic problem. Try [adding an hour or two a night](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-can-you-catch-up-on-sleep/) until you get back on track, then stick to a consistent sleep schedule.)

Think you can get by on six hours of sleep? Chances are, you can’t. **Walker explains that less than 1% of the population is able to get six hours of sleep and show no impairment** (this is largely genetic and relates to the BHLHE41 gene). Everyone else is just fooling themselves and propping up their energy with caffeine. He says that power naps aren’t a magic bullet either—they’re most effective at the _onset_ of fatigue, not when you’re already sleep deprived.

Sleep deprivation is an insidious problem because **when you’re sleep deprived, you don’t know how poorly you’re performing.** (This is like being drunk and thinking you’re far more capable of doing things than you actually are.) And if you’re chronically sleep-deprived, your low performance becomes a new baseline, so it’s hard for you to see just how badly you’re performing.

#### The High Risk of Sleep Deprivation

Walker warns that the combination of reduced concentration and an inflated sense of your capabilities in a sleep-deprived state is especially harmful during high-risk activities, like driving. To put the risk into perspective:

- Driving after having slept less than four hours increases crash risk 11.5 times.
- Being awake for 19 hours (being past your bedtime by three hours) is as cognitively impairing as being legally drunk.
- Adding alcohol to sleep deficits has a multiplicative effect on mistakes, not just an additive one.

(Shortform note: In the original text, Walker wrote that there are more vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving than by alcohol and drugs combined. He has since removed this vague claim from the book and revised it to include statistics, saying it’s hard to objectively quantify the number of accidents due to drowsy driving versus driving under the influence.)

Why do sleep deficits cause more accidents? Part of it is **delayed reaction time**. Another part is a “**microsleep**,” where your eyelids shut for just a few seconds and you go unconscious and lose motor control. If you’re in a car going 60 mph, falling asleep for just a few seconds could result in a terrible accident.

> According to Walker, [the number of accidents related to drowsy driving](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#accidents) is somewhere between 70,000 to 1.2 million (see above Shortform note). Keep yourself from turning into a statistic by knowing the [telltale signs that you’re too sleepy](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/26/health/personal-health-dark-side-of-holidays-sleep-deprived-drivers.html) to get behind the wheel:
> 
> - You’re likely to fall asleep while reading, watching television, or riding a car as a passenger.
>     
> - You keep yawning, your eyelids feel heavy, and you have a hard time focusing your eyes.
>     
> - You keep veering to the center line or to the edge of the road and miss traffic signs.
>

> 
> - Going on a long drive? Get a full night’s sleep and have two other people in the car—one to take over the wheel and another to help the driver stay awake.
>     
> - Don’t drive during your usual sleep time.
>     
> - Snack on something packed with protein. Don’t eat a big, carbohydrate-heavy meal before driving.

#### Sleep Deprivation in the Medical Field

Impaired attention and concentration have dire consequences in the medical field—Walker reports that sleep-deprived residents show greater risk of medical errors, surgical errors, misdiagnoses, and careless deaths. (Recall that after 22 hours without sleep, performance is impaired to the same level as being legally drunk.)

First-year residents are now limited to 24-hour shifts and 80-hour weeks. Later-year residents have no such restriction, since the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education claims the medical error studies were done only on first-year residents.

Walker explains that structurally, the medical system resists change for fear of limiting training volume. Also, older doctors may fear this encourages laziness, relative to what the attending doctors had to suffer through.

(Shortform note: In his original text, Walker stated that limiting residents to 16-hour shifts with an eight-hour rest period led to “400-600% fewer diagnostic errors.” [He corrects this in the second edition](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#Miscellany), replacing the percentages with the phrase “significantly fewer.” Medical schools and teaching hospitals now [recognize the importance of giving medical residents ample rest](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/residents-are-sleep-deprived-so-what-s-new#:~:text=And%20as%20suspected%2C%20data%20show,to%20depression%20and%20social%20isolation%20) and have taken steps to address the problem. Some universities have sleep pods and hotel-style rooms where students can nap, while UCLA encourages residents to have “beeper buddies”— residents who can take colleagues’ beepers to give them time for uninterrupted rest.)

### Sleep Deprivation Worsens Emotional Control

A baby that doesn’t get its nap time tends to get cranky. Adults are the same way.

The amygdala is the part of your brain responsible for emotions like fear and anxiety. Normally, it’s held in check by your prefrontal cortex (the rational part of your brain). However, Walker says that when you’re sleep deprived, this suppression is weakened, and your amygdala can run amok, leading to 60% **more emotional reactivity**. The highs can be higher, and the lows lower.

On the other side of fear and anxiety, he says that positive rewards and dopamine may be amplified by sleep deprivation too. Therefore, **sleep deprivation can intensify sensation-seeking, risk-taking, and addiction**.

More gravely, sleep may play an important role in mental illness. Walker provides suggestive evidence:

- Sleep disruption is a common symptom of all mood disorders. The causation is unclear: does bad sleep cause mood disorders, or do mood disorders cause bad sleep, or both? But the author believes sleep plays at least _some_ aggravating role.
- One night of sleep deprivation can trigger a manic or depressive episode in bipolar patients.
- Sleep deprivation is associated with suicidal ideation in teenagers.
- Surprisingly, sleep deprivation makes one-third of depression patients feel better, possibly by amplifying their positive emotions. However, it makes two-thirds feel worse, so it isn’t prescribed as a treatment. (Shortform note: Research from the [University of Lincoln](https://sleep.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) in the U.K. suggests [why sleep deprivation might be helpful for some](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181009-how-sleep-helps-with-emotional-recovery-and-trauma): People with a specific mutation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene are more prone to revisiting negative memories during sleep, so sleeping less can be more beneficial. Meanwhile, a 2021 study suggests that [waking up one hour earlier could decrease the risk of major depression by 23%](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210528114107.htm).)

> **A Changing Stance on Sleep Deprivation as Treatment**
> 
> [Guzey writes that Walker downplays the benefits of sleep deprivation](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#no-a-good-nights-sleep-is-not-always-beneficial-sleep-deprivation-therapy-in-depression) as the author notes that it works in 30-40% of patients with depression and ends up making 60-70% feel worse. Guzey states that, according to studies, it can be beneficial to about 45-50%. He writes that by misrepresenting the numbers, Walker may be discouraging people with depression from seeking this form of treatment.
> 
> In his blog, Walker clarifies that the [findings that sleep deprivation can be beneficial to nearly half of patients with depression emerged after the book was written](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#depression). He has revised the book to reflect his stance on sleep deprivation, changing the text from “sleep deprivation is not a realistic or comprehensive therapy option” to “sleep deprivation _alone_ is not a realistic or comprehensive therapy option” [emphasis ours].
> 
> Guzey also takes issue with Walker’s seemingly contradictory statements on sleep deprivation. In an early chapter, Walker writes that thousands of studies prove that there are no biological functions that do not benefit from a good night’s sleep. But in a later chapter, he writes about the benefits of sleep deprivation. In his blog post, [Walker responds to Guzey’s comment](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#depression) by saying that the positions aren’t contradictory, but instead demonstrate the breadth and complexity of the topic of sleep deprivation. It’s worth noting that Walker’s original statement that thousands of studies prove that no biological functions can benefit from sleep deprivation has been edited out of the second edition of the book.

### Sleep Deprivation May Contribute to Alzheimer’s

While Walker says there is no definitive causal link between the two, he notes that sleep loss may contribute to Alzheimer’s through a few mechanisms:

- Frontal lobe degeneration—especially through Alzheimer’s characteristic amyloid plaques (clumps of toxic protein that poison neurons)—disrupts NREM sleep.
- Lack of NREM sleep disrupts memory formation, a key symptom of Alzheimer’s. (Notably, the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with memory, is not affected by amyloid plaques. This presents a conundrum to scientists on why memory is disrupted in Alzheimer’s.)
- Lack of NREM sleep disrupts the glymphatic cleanup system, a process which typically shrinks glial cells beside neurons during sleep in order to more effectively clear out amyloid plaques. Sleep loss precedes Alzheimer’s by several years, suggesting this could be an early diagnostic.

It’s easy to see how a vicious cycle can occur—frontal lobe degeneration disrupts NREM sleep, which causes further frontal lobe degeneration.

Walker suggests that encouraging NREM sleep, through artificial brain stimulation if needed, might be therapeutic for Alzheimer’s. It could also be preventative, in the same way that cholesterol-reducing drugs protect against heart disease.

(Shortform note: A study suggests that [sleeping on your side can help decrease the chances of developing Alzheimer’s](https://neurosciencenews.com/lateral-sleep-position-neurology-2363/#:~:text=Sleeping%20in%20the%20lateral%2C%20or,researchers%20at%20Stony%20Brook%20University) and other neurological diseases. This is because the position may more effectively remove brain waste that causes the plaque buildup linked to Alzheimer’s. If you want to switch from sleeping on your back or your stomach to sleeping on your side, [get a pillow that keeps your body aligned](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-pillows/best-pillow-for-side-sleepers#:~:text=Side%20sleepers%20usually%20need%20a,at%20least%204%20inches%20thick.)—plump enough to fit perfectly between your ear and shoulder, and firm enough to support your neck. Place a pillow between your knees to help align your back and hips, as well.)

### Just _How Bad_ Is Sleep Deprivation?

Given its damaging effects, sleep deprivation _torture_ is recognized by many countries as unethical, but it’s still practiced by others (like the US in Abu Ghraib).

According to Walker, sleep deprivation doesn’t even work well. It reduces the quality of information (harms memory recall) and increases the risk of lying and false confessions in a desperate hope to get some sleep.

(Shortform note: Reports in 2021 confirm that some countries still use sleep deprivation as a form of torture. In Russia, a jailed Kremlin critic said that [guards would wake him up every hour of the night](https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-court-rejects-navalnys-attempt-quash-his-flight-risk-jail-status-2021-06-02/). In Myanmar, a former detainee revealed how suspects had to [sit through rotating interrogators throughout the night](https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/a/1725625.html). An article about [a tortured prisoner in China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/they-tortured-me-australian-yang-hengjun-says-as-he-awaits-verdict-after-trial-in-china) referenced a [Human Rights Watch Report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/05/13/tiger-chairs-and-cell-bosses/police-torture-criminal-suspects-china) that detailed China’s torture methods, which included sleep deprivation, “tiger chairs” (to restrain suspects during interrogation), and “cell bosses” (detainees who abuse fellow prisoners).)
