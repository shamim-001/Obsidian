## Part 3.2: Cut Out External Triggers: Technology

In this chapter, we’ll examine ways to diminish the power of the second type of external trigger—the technology you use every day.

### Trigger #5: Smartphone

Your smartphone is probably one of the most—if not _the_ most—distracting things in your life. However, it can also be a valuable tool for staying in touch with people, listening to music, capturing photos, or navigating. **Maximize your phone’s use as a tool for traction by first rearranging your apps and then adjusting their settings.**

#### Step 1: Sort Your Apps

Look through the apps on your phone and assess each honestly: Does it benefit _you_ or do you benefit _it_? Based on your answer, take one of three actions:

**1) Remove:** Delete unused apps and apps that don’t benefit you or don’t align with your values.

- For example, you might keep a mindfulness app but delete a news app that always makes you feel stressed out.

**2) Change:** Some apps _can_ be used for traction, but they show up in your life as distractions.

- For example, you may use social media to stay in touch with friends and promote your business, but you also check it when you’re with family, at work, or driving.

For these apps, _change_ where you use them—that is, delete them from your phone and use them exclusively on your computer. When you’re unable to access these apps anytime and anywhere, you’re more likely to use them only during their timebox.

**3) Rearrange:** At this stage, your phone will have only traction-supporting apps—but even these can be distracting visual cues on a cluttered home screen. Avoid this by making your home screen as minimalist as possible, organizing your apps into three categories:

- Tools: Apps in this category help you with everyday tasks—it might include maps, your calendar, Uber, and so on.
- Goals: Apps in this category help you with things you’d like to spend your time doing, such as mindfulness, exercise, or audiobooks.
- Everything else: Your tools and goals apps should be the only ones on your home screen. Everything else can be organized into folders on the secondary screen. For example, you may have a “Communication” folder that contains your email, messenger, and WhatsApp.

#### Step 2: Go Notification-Free

The second part of diminishing your phone’s distractions is cutting out the temptation to look at it in the first place. Most people look at their phones when they receive a notification because it grabs their attention with a ding, vibration, or lit-up screen. **By disabling notifications, you eliminate these external triggers.**

Timebox 30 minutes in your schedule to readjust your app settings—be sure to pay attention to both the _audio_ and _visual_ settings, as both can interrupt your focus.

- **Audio notifications are especially distracting because they can grab your attention even if your phone is face down or in another room.** Think about which of these apps _truly_ needs your attention at any moment, depending on your life and work. For example, a student may keep sound activated _only_ for phone calls, but a small business owner might keep her email sound activated so she can immediately check incoming orders.
- **Visual notifications only work when you can see your phone, but you can adjust how prominent they are.** You may set your essential apps to light up your home screen when notifications come in and adjust your less important apps to only display a small red bubble when there are notifications to check.

### Trigger #6: Desktop

**Having a cluttered desktop as the background to your work can drain your cognitive ability.** Studies show that when people have disorganized objects in their field of vision, they perform worse on cognitive tasks than people who have organized objects in their field of vision. Additionally, when you look for something specific on a cluttered desktop, you encounter many visual reminders of questions to answer, tasks to complete, things you wanted to look into, and so on. These visual reminders of easy and interesting tasks can easily trigger you to escape from the discomfort of your work.

There are two ways to manage your desktop clutter:

**1) Sort everything on your desktop into out-of-sight folders.** This organizes your desktop so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and reduce your chances of being distracted by visual reminders.

- Like Eyal, you can take this step to an indistractable extreme. He leaves his desktop completely blank except for one or two files he’s currently working on. Everything else is filed into one folder labeled “Everything.” Whenever he needs a file, he’ll use his laptop’s search feature instead of sifting through the folder—this guarantees he won’t come across any distracting visual reminders.

**2) Disable desktop notifications.** Turn off notifications for anything that might grab your attention while you work, such as group chat, email, your music streaming app, and so on. If your computer has a Do Not Disturb feature, set it for parts of the day when you’re focusing.

### Trigger #7: Articles

Articles pop into your day constantly—you may receive a news alert in the morning, get sidetracked while doing research for work, or see a good read while scrolling social media. Often, you’ll either read these articles right away—distracting you from the activity you _should_ be doing—or you’ll save them for later across numerous open tabs—cluttering your workspace with tempting visual reminders.

**Articles are interesting, knowledge-boosting tools when used the right way—rather than cutting them out, change how and when you spend time on them.** The most important step in this change is to _stop reading articles on your web browser._

- Eyal recommends the browser extension and app [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) for this step. When you come across an interesting article, clicking the Pocket icon on your browser will pull the article text—leaving out ads and recommendations—and save it to the Pocket app linked on your phone.

With this system, you don’t have to choose between reading an article right away or keeping it open in the background—the content is kept tucked away until you’re ready to read.

(Shortform note: Eyal recommends Pocket, but there are many similar services available.)

#### Get More Out of Your Articles With Temptation Bundling

Not only are tucked-away articles less distracting, but they can also be used as a reward in _temptation bundling_—making an unappealing activity more interesting by combining it with something you _want_ to do.

- For example, the Pocket app has a text-to-speech feature, so you can use it in the same way the study participants did—combine the pleasure of listening to your saved articles with less interesting activities such as meal prepping, going to the gym, mowing the lawn, or doing laundry.

### Trigger #8: Social Media Feeds

One of the most addictive features of social media is the “news feed,” which usually has an “infinite scroll.” You can scroll through pictures and posts without ever coming to the end of the page—you don’t stop, because there’s no natural place to do so.

Without the infinite scroll of the news feed, social media becomes much less entertaining—and that’s a good thing. **When you have control over what you see, social media can be used as a tool rather than a distraction.** There are three ways you can circumvent the news feed on various social media.

#### 1. Install a News Feed Blocker

There are many extensions you can install on your web browser to prevent you from seeing your Facebook news feed, such as:

- [News Feed Eradicator for Facebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg): The homepage won’t display any posts. Rather, you’ll see a blank page with an inspirational quote.
- [Todobook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todobook/ihbejplhkeifejcpijadinaicidddbde?hl=en): Instead of seeing your news feed, you’ll see your to-do list. When you complete all the tasks for the day, the list disappears and the news feed reappears.

(Shortform note: Both of these extensions are currently available only on Google Chrome.)

#### 2. Preload Specific Pages

Most people access social media sites by going to the homepage, which contains the news feed. **Skip over the homepage entirely by navigating directly to the page you want to access.**

To do this, save specific frequently visited or important URLs to your bookmarks bar. Clicking on these links will take you directly to the part of the site you _want_ to be on—helping you use social media more deliberately and efficiently.

- For example, instead of bookmarking Facebook.com, you might bookmark Facebook.com/messages or Facebook.com/[your business page].

#### 3. Block Recommendations

Social media sites run algorithms in the background while you use them, figuring out what types of videos and articles will be most appealing to you based on your past activity. They’ll then give you a list of recommendations, tempting you to keep clicking.

- A fairly obvious example of this is Youtube’s “recommended videos” list—by combining interesting video thumbnails with subjects you’re interested in, it can easily drag you into _hours_ of unplanned video-watching.

Many web browsers have features to turn off these recommendations, and there are extensions you can download to manage especially tempting sites.

- For example, the Google Chrome extension [DF Tube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en) allows you to watch videos without recommendations, autoplay, or comments.
