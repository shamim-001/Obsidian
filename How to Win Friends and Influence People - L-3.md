## Likability 3: Say the Person’s Name

### Principles

- **A name is a person’s identity. It makes her unique among all others.** Remembering it and calling a person by it makes her feel important.
- A name is one of the most important words in a person’s entire vocabulary. A person’s name to her is far more important than all the other names in the rest of the world combined.
- Saying the name is a subtle and welcome compliment. Forgetting it or misspelling it is a crippling mistake that suggests you didn’t care enough to get it right.
    - Politician maxim: “To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.”
    - A businessperson who can’t remember names is saying she can’t remember a big piece of her business.
- People pay loads of money to have their names remembered after they die (naming buildings, having park bench plaques dedicated to them).

### Tactics

- Use it multiple times in conversation. This will help you remember it and also sweeten what you have to say to the listener.
- Try to tie together the name and details about a person to form a longer-lasting image.
- If it’s an unusual name, ask how it’s spelled.
- Bother to get difficult to pronounce names correct, eg names from foreign languages.
- Address emails or letters warmly.
- Get to know your customers’ names, especially if you operate a retail store.
- Get to know servicepeople’s names when you interact with them frequently.

### Examples

- As a child, Carnegie had a large litter of rabbits. He promised that anyone who helped him pick clovers and feed would get a rabbit named after her.
- Later, Carnegie wanted the business of the Pennsylvania Railroad, run by Edgar Thomson, so he named the local steel mill “Edgar Thomson Steel Works.”
- He wanted to merge with the sleeping car company Pullman. When Carnegie mentioned the new company would be called Pullman still, Pullman became far more eager.
