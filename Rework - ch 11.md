## Chapter 11: Help Your Employees Thrive

In this final chapter of the summary, we’ll examine the notion of “company culture.” Specifically, we’ll learn how to create a workplace in which staff members do their best and enjoy their jobs.

### Principle 1: Don't Force a "Company Culture" on Your Employees

**A great company culture develops over time through consistent positive actions,** not by installing foosball tables or espresso machines. If managers treat their employees kindly, kindness will become part of the company culture. If employees leave work daily at 5 p.m., then a healthy work/life balance becomes the cultural norm.

### Principle 2: Create a Workplace Where Everyone Flourishes

It's impossible to hire only geniuses and rock stars, so stop trying to. Instead, focus your energies on creating an environment in which every employee can do his or her best work. Even a mediocre employee can do outstanding work in a nurturing workplace. Give your employees the tools, space, privacy, respect, and trust they need to achieve greatness.

### Principle 3: Treat Employees Like Adults

It's a waste of time and energy to regulate your employees' work hours or police their actions during the workday. Banning employees from social media sites or telling them they need approval for a $10 lunch expense creates an atmosphere of mistrust—and doesn't make them more productive.

### Principle 4: Hire People Who Have a Life Outside Work

Remember the discussion about workaholics in Chapter 1? Workaholics throw extra hours at a problem when they should be looking for a smart, efficient shortcut. They're martyrs who create more problems than they solve. You want to hire employees who know how to manage their time wisely and productively.

#### **Do This, Not That**

Instead of hiring someone who's willing to give 100 hours a week to your company, hire the person who has a full, busy life outside of work. That person will be the most efficient worker.

### Principle 5: Don't Create Needless Policies

Just because an employee does something wrong once doesn't mean you need to create a policy addressing the error. Policy-making often feels like punishment. Instead of punishing your whole crew for one person's mishap, talk to that person directly. Only create a policy if the problem happens repeatedly.

### Principle 6: Communicate Simply and Clearly

Direct, straightforward language is the only kind you should use with your employees (and also with the outside world). Don't use industry jargon or corporate-speak in the interest of sounding "professional." Drop the fake formality.

#### **Do This, Not That**

Whether you're giving an employee feedback, writing a blog post, speaking at a conference, talking to customers, or writing an email, speak in your authentic voice.

### Principle 7: Avoid Absolutist Language

Too often in business we use phrases like "I need this by the end of the day," "we can't spend more time on this," or "you should be able to do this easily." These kinds of directives create unnecessary tension and stress. Likewise, extreme words like "can't," "never," and "need" send a bossy, do-what-I-say message. When people hear them, they bristle.

#### **Do This, Not That**

When you "need" something done immediately, try phrasing it as a question: "Do you think you could finish this by the end of the day?" And when you're about to say you "can't" launch the product in its current state, ask yourself if that's really true. If it is, ask yourself if there's another way to phrase it.

Along the same lines, limit your use of "ASAP." Most things don't really need to happen as soon as possible. **Every request is not equally urgent, so save ASAP for when it really matters.**

### Conclusion: Grab Your Inspiration and Go

**The final principle:** If you feel inspired to create a product or start a business, get to work right now. Inspiration is a wonderful tool that can help you do two week's work in two hours. But inspiration doesn't hang around and wait for you. It's a temporary state, and it's up to you to squeeze the most out of it whenever you get the chance.
