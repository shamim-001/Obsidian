## Arguments 11: Make Your Ideas Vivid

### Principles

- Most people are not as rational and data-driven as they may think. They are swayed by emotions and by heuristics that allow fast decision making. They make decisions by gut.
- Simply stating the truth isn’t enough. You have to use showmanship. Make the truth vivid and dramatic.
- Attention is scarcer than ever before. Find ways to capture it, without being gimmicky.

### Tactics

- Find a way to visually, viscerally represent the stakes.
- (Shortform note: The book doesn’t give clear rules on how to do this, but some suggestions:
    - Provide a visual analogy. Show objects for size, speed, cost.
    - Equate the opportunity to dollars, or dollars per second. Then analogize this further (eg a Mercedes-Benz a day)
    - Put physical objects in the person’s face.
    - Show the extremes of performance with memorable imagery. These should be applications that are far outside normal usage, that then make it obvious the product can be used in normal circumstances.)

### Examples

- A cash register salesman observed a slow-moving checkout line. He told the owner he was losing pennies with every customer. He threw pennies on the floor to make the point. [I imagine he could keep doing this repeatedly to illustrate the money lost the entire day.]
- A consultant hired to study facial creams for a manufacturer got nowhere with charts and reports. So the next time he dumped dozens of facial creams with annotations on the president’s desk.
- A disgruntled employee who wasn’t getting on his boss’s schedule wrote a letter with a self-addressed envelope, asking him to fill it out and return. It had a Mad-Libs style note, “I will be able to see you on **at** AM/PM for __ minutes.”
- (Shorform example: Infomercials have iconic demonstrations of the product - a vacuum lifting a bowling bowl, waterpoof tape sealing a boat back together.)
- (Shortform example: Steve Jobs famously introduced the iPod as 1000 songs in your pocket, rather than droning about how it had 10 GB of storage. He also pulled the Macbook Air out of a manila envelope.)
- (Shortform note: Dale Carnegie himself uses this technique in the book, using examples of larger-than-life figures like Lincoln, Rockefeller, and Charles Schwab. The idea is, “if these techniques worked for these people, surely they’ll work for me.”)
