# Antifragile

## Chapters 1-2: What Is Antifragility?

_Antifragile_ is the fourth book in former options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s five-book _Incerto_ series, which explores randomness and its unpredictable effects. In this book, Taleb discusses strategies and principles that will allow us to be helped by unforeseen events rather than harmed by them.

People often think that the opposite of fragility is durability. If something is fragile, that means it’s easily broken. Therefore, if something isn’t easily broken, logically that should mean it’s the opposite of fragile. **However, there’s another step beyond durability: something that actually gets stronger under stress.** Since there isn’t an established English word for such a thing, let’s call it _antifragility_—not just the lack of fragility, but its true opposite.

_Antifragile_ discusses:

- What antifragility is
- Why antifragility is necessary in all aspects of life
- Sources of fragility and antifragility
- Strategies to avoid fragility and seek antifragility
- Short-term versus long-term stability and why the latter depends on antifragility
- The ethical components of fragility and antifragility

### What Antifragility Is

The fact that there’s nothing in the dictionary to describe antifragility doesn’t stop us from experiencing and using it in our everyday lives. For instance, every time we exercise, damaging our muscles so that they’ll become stronger, we’re taking advantage of our inherent antifragility.

To truly understand the difference between fragility, durability, and antifragility, consider some figures from mythology. First, in the tale of Damocles, the titular character is seated at a feast with a sword hanging over him. The sword is suspended from the ceiling by a single horsehair. This is _fragility_: It’s only a matter of time before that hair breaks and Damocles dies.

Now think about the phoenix, the legendary bird that’s reborn from its own ashes after it dies. This is _durability_: No matter what happens to it, the phoenix will always return to the same state as before.

Finally, consider the hydra, a monster from ancient Greek mythology that grows back two heads if one is cut off. Unlike the phoenix, which is reborn into an identical body, **the hydra actually gets stronger by being hurt.** This is _antifragility_.

While each book in Taleb’s _Incerto_ series can be read on its own, they have some common themes and build on one another. In particular, _Antifragile_ builds on ideas from _The Black Swan_, which is about the unexpectedly large impact of unpredictable and unlikely events. _Antifragile_ teaches us how to turn such events to our advantage.

#### Why We Need Antifragility

We live in an unpredictable world. The models and theories we use to try to predict the future invariably fall apart as unforeseen events prove them wrong and, in turn, destroy the plans we made based on those models. Clearly, systems based on such flawed models are bound to be fragile—easily broken.

The solution to this problem is antifragility. Instead of a never-ending search for more accurate models and better predictions, **all we need to do is make sure that we’re in a position to benefit from uncertainty and volatility instead of being harmed by it.**

This is hardly a new concept; nature exhibits antifragility in nearly everything she creates. An organism can strengthen itself through minor damage in the form of exercise, while a species can strengthen itself through minor damage in the form of natural selection, which leads to evolution.

However, unlike nature, humans try to control the world through models and rules. We think we can perfectly predict the future and avoid any shocks that would cause our fragile systems to fall apart. We think we can outsmart millions of years of evolution and antifragility, and we’re almost invariably wrong.

Instead of trying to predict the future, we should assume that there will be major events we can’t see coming—because, sooner or later, there will be. If we’re prepared for them, using the methods and practices explained in this book, we can make sure that such events work to our advantage instead of hurting us. **By avoiding fragility and embracing antifragility wherever possible, we can set ourselves up to thrive in an uncertain world.**

### Early Forms of Antifragility

We can find another form of antifragility in the legend of Mithridates IV, king of Pontus. According to the story, after his father’s assassination, Mithridates began taking small doses of various poisons to build up tolerance for them. This practice came to be called _Antidotum Mithridatium_—in English, we could call it _Mithraditization_.

Nero’s mother Agrippina also used Mithraditization when she suspected that her son would try to poison her. It worked, and Nero’s assassins were unable to kill the queen by poisoning; unfortunately for Agrippina, that just meant that they had to resort to blades. Mithraditization is seen even in modern medicine: Vaccines could be considered a form of it. However, Mithraditization isn’t true antifragility. It makes you more durable, less likely to be harmed in the future, but you don’t actually improve yourself by taking it.

More relevant to the current topic is _hormesis_, a phenomenon where a small dose of a toxic substance actually stimulates an organism’s growth or improves its health. German toxicologist Hugo Schulz noticed that small doses of a particular poison would cause yeast to grow faster, while larger doses would slow the growth or kill off the yeast.

There are also claims—unconfirmed—that restricting calorie intake causes a variety of healthy reactions in the body. Note that this is not about cutting down on overeating, but reducing calories to starvation or near-starvation level, at least temporarily. However, another possible interpretation is that too much food, eaten too regularly, is bad for you, and reinstating the stressor of hunger helps return humans to a more natural and healthier state. In this case, hunger itself is the “toxin” that makes the organism stronger.

As a side note, Hormesis lost a great deal of clout in the scientific community after the 1930s, when it became conflated with homeopathy. Homeopathy is the belief that diseases can be cured by introducing extremely diluted parts of what causes the disease: viruses, poisons, and so on. However, homeopathy uses such small amounts of these agents that it can’t possibly cause hormesis—or do much of anything, for that matter. Homeopathy, unlike hormesis, has very little scientific evidence backing it up.

The key point is that certain types of stress are actually good for you, and taking them away can actually be harmful. For a classic example, consider exercise: You slightly damage your body so that it will become stronger by repairing itself.

#### Domain Dependence: Understanding Requires Context

People struggle to identify concepts outside of the context in which they originally learned those ideas. This concept is called _domain dependence_, with “domain” referring to a particular subject or type of activity. If you’ve ever bumped into a coworker or teacher in the supermarket and had trouble recognizing each other, then you already understand this problem.

Regarding antifragility, the idea of certain systems needing stressors to function isn’t a new one, but people who understand this fact in some aspects of life fail to transfer it to others. That’s why, for example, a scientist who’s familiar with hormesis might not be able to recognize the same sort of antifragility in economics, or the process of invention and discovery.

No matter the field, occasional problems provide valuable information and experience that strengthen our overall understanding and ability in that field. However, the average person will only see these incidents as setbacks and failures.

### Growth Through Struggle

Doctors have observed extreme cases of antifragility in humans, which they call post-traumatic growth. In simple terms, it’s the opposite of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While those who experience the much more well-known PTSD continue to suffer from past events, those who experience post-traumatic growth are somehow improved by it. In fact, there’s a short test that suggests various forms that improvement could take: the [Post Traumatic Growth Inventory.](http://www.cscd.osaka-u.ac.jp/user/rosaldo/VIII-B_Post-Traumatic-Growth-Inventory.pdf)

However, while many people may not have heard of post-traumatic growth, almost everyone has heard some variation of the expression “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.” Perhaps this is just another example of domain dependence at work.

Another phrase, “necessity is the mother of invention,” points to another, more immediate, sort of antifragility seen in humans. Basically, what happens is that people overreact to setbacks—they’re spurred to use more energy and effort than is needed to compensate for the problems. That excess energy goes on to become innovation and progress.

The hardship does not have to be extreme nor dramatic—although dramatic hardships have certainly led to some remarkable developments, such as John Hetrick inventing the airbag after being in a near-disastrous car crash with his wife and daughter. However, minor difficulties can also spur people on to greater results.

A speaker who is quiet or hard to understand will capture his audience’s attention more effectively than one who sounds like a trained actor—by straining to hear and understand him, the audience will inevitably pay more attention and retain the information better. Naturally, though, this only works up to a point. **An audience that can barely understand the speaker will pay closer attention; an audience that can’t hear him at all will simply give up.**

The opposite is also true: A lack of challenge causes people to _undercompensate_. For example, the automation of airplanes at first actually led to an increase in preventable flying accidents. The pilots were simply becoming complacent and—more dangerously—bored. Their skills and their attention waned, and as a result they got into accidents that more alert pilots wouldn’t have.

Many social scientists will talk about _equilibrium_, or balance between opposite ideas like supply and demand. In equilibrium, any shift in one of those ideas will be countered by a shift in the other—so if there is suddenly a greater demand for particular goods, the companies who make those goods will start producing more to meet it. Equilibrium is commonly thought of as a desirable state, if not the absolute goal of a healthy economy.

However, if we consider an economy to be a complex, living system (which we’ll discuss in more detail later), then equilibrium could mean death. If the economy is never subjected to stresses or shocks, then it’s deprived of the chance to benefit from antifragility. A system that becomes _too_ stable, _too_ fixed, becomes weak and may be badly damaged or destroyed when such a shock inevitably happens.

### Overcompensation in Various Forms

**_Redundancy_ is a form of overcompensation and therefore, of antifragility.** Physically, humans (and many other organisms) have redundant systems to improve their chances of survival. For example, we have two lungs and two kidneys, though we could survive with only one of each. Humans developing an extra kidney is no different from the hydra growing an extra head after being injured—it’s a preparation for worse events that may happen in the future, but in the meantime, it makes us stronger and more efficient at filtering waste from the blood.

In fact, all organisms follow a similar pattern of redundancy and overcompensation. If you were to trace evolutionary trends throughout history, you’d find that natural selection tends to favor species that overcompensate for their environments, rather than those that adapt to meet the exact challenges of their surroundings.

**We can also see redundancy in many places outside of organisms.** Countries that stock supplies of food or oil in preparation for a future disaster are practicing redundancy, storing away more than they need now in case hard times hit later. Those supplies can also, if the opportunity arises, be sold at great profit to other countries who find themselves in dire need of them—this shows again that the overreaction to hardship can strengthen the system in the long run.

Even abstract ideas can demonstrate antifragility. Riots and rebellions, for example, respond to any attempt to put them down with force by becoming stronger—the people are outraged about their situation, and oppressing them more only fuels their rage.

At the other end of the emotional spectrum, there are countless stories of love demonstrating antifragility. _Romeo and Juliet_ is perhaps the most famous example—the young lovers’ feelings become stronger with every attempt their families make to keep them apart.

**Information, too, is antifragile.** Attempts to ban books invariably make those books more popular—just look at _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ or the _Harry Potter_ series. Similarly, harsh criticism of books or ideas only serves to draw more attention to them; millions of people have read Ayn Rand’s extreme libertarian works despite—or because of—all the negative attention they receive.

Even some (though not all) careers are antifragile. There are accounts of actors paying journalists to write about their performances; many actors would pay for positive reviews, but the truly clever ones would pay for _negative_ reviews, knowing that those would attract much more attention. On the other hand, someone like a bank manager needs to have a clean reputation and would suffer terribly from bad press.

A humorous rule of thumb is that the more flamboyantly someone dresses, the more antifragile his or her job is.
