## Part 2: The Internal Fight | Master Your Emotions

So far, we’ve established that Stoics view everything that happens as neither intrinsically good nor bad—instead, they believe that _you_ determine whether something will positively or negatively impact your life depending on how you perceive the situation. Additionally, we’ve discussed how Holiday believes that your ultimate purpose should be to improve your life and the lives of others, and positively interpreting the events in your life will give you the strength to overcome obstacles on your way to this goal.

For the rest of this guide, we’ll be discussing specific strategies to help you accomplish this: ways to reorient your thinking and seize the opportunities within your obstacles. In this part, “The Internal Fight,” we’ll focus on Holiday’s internal, emotional strategies for success. These tips will help you avoid becoming demoralized by external events and keep you motivated to pursue your life purpose. (In the book, Holiday refers to this practice as “The Discipline of Will.”)

### Introduction to Emotional Discipline

Stoic philosophers emphasize the importance of **emotional regulation—intentionally deciding which emotions you will allow to influence your behavior**. Holiday argues that this is a practical skill that everyone can (and must) learn.

It’s a simple fact of life: You will frequently feel emotions (such as fear and anger) that work against you and push you away from your goals. If you don’t exert control over these unhelpful emotions, you’ll sabotage yourself before you’ve even begun to take action.

Holiday makes it clear: This doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to have feelings. It’s likely impossible to suppress every negative feeling you have. Give yourself time to feel whatever emotions naturally arise. However, also work toward an emotional state that motivates you to act. **It’s okay to feel any emotion. It’s not okay to let your emotions prevent you from doing what’s right.** For example, if your coworker angers and embarrasses you by deliberately pointing out your mistake in front of the boss, give yourself a minute to calm down, then continue to work as best you can.

Additionally, Holiday emphasizes that your emotional state is completely under your control. It can’t be weakened or stopped by any external forces. This makes emotional regulation one of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal.

> **_Eupatheiai_: The Only Good Emotions**
> 
> Holiday’s stance on emotion regulation is less extreme than the original Stoic teachings. Holiday sees negative feelings as more or less an inevitable part of life, defining “The Discipline of Will” as the ability to act despite your unhelpful emotions. On the other hand, traditional Stoics [believed that by exerting your rationality, you can learn to completely cleanse yourself of harmful emotions](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/). They saw all negative emotions as a failure of rationality and argued that by exercising logic, you would realize that you had nothing to be upset about. Like Holiday, they emphasized that everyone has the power—and obligation—to control their emotional state.
> 
> In fact, traditional Stoics believed virtuous people should only feel three emotions: the three _eupatheiai_, or “good states.” These were _chara, boulêsis_, and _eulabeia_, commonly translated as joy, wish, and caution. “Joy” is the rational judgment about something good in the present, “wish” is the rational judgment about something good in the future, and “caution” is the rational judgment about something bad in the future.
> 
> The Stoics denied the idea that anything could be rationally judged as bad in the present. Since they believed in _logos_, a rational power bringing order to the universe, they maintained that everything in the present was good, unfolding according to its fate.

Here are some tactics you can use to conquer the negative emotions keeping you from living a fulfilling, virtuous life:

- Use logic to defuse your unhelpful emotions.
- Redirect your emotions into helpful contexts.
- Prepare for long-term hardship.
- Take things step-by-step.
- Motivate yourself by helping others.
- Accept everything that happens.

Let’s investigate each of these strategies in turn:

### Strategy #1: Use Logic to Defuse Your Unhelpful Emotions

Holiday claims that by slowing down and analyzing your situation logically, you can soothe unhelpful, impulsive emotions like panic or anger. All it takes is a rational eye to see that no event is necessarily bad, as we discussed earlier. Every unhelpful emotion you have indicates that you’re not seeing things clearly enough.

Holiday argues that **our initial emotional reactions are based on unrealistic expectations**. These expectations are the only thing making you upset. If you compare what has happened to what you think “should have” happened, you’ll be constantly dissatisfied—an unhelpful emotion that does nothing but demotivate you. Alternatively, if you logically come to terms with the fact that we live in an uncertain world and there will always be unforeseeable setbacks of some kind, these events will have less of an impact on your emotional state.

#### Mental Exercises to Help Defuse Unhelpful Emotions

To practice using logic to manage your emotions, Holiday suggests adopting this habit: Whenever you feel yourself being tugged around by your emotions, **stop and interview yourself to discover why you feel the way you do**. Ask yourself questions, then answer them logically. Holiday sees unhelpful emotions as the root of every problem you think you have, and you can overcome them by clarifying what irrational beliefs are making you feel this way and replacing them with a logical counterargument.

Holiday offers another mental trick to help if you’re having trouble being objective about a situation you’re involved in: **Pretend the situation is happening, not to you, but to someone you know**. **Think of what you’d advise them to do**. When you don’t personally identify with a problem, it becomes easier to solve, as your own excuses and biases no longer get in the way.

> **Think It Through, but Don’t Ruminate**
> 
> In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/)_, Daniel Goleman [concurs with Holiday that much of the time, our negative emotions are caused by unrealistic assumptions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2). He also agrees that slowing down and challenging these assumptions with logic is often a good way to defuse strong emotions. However, Goleman offers a caveat to this advice, noting that it’s important not to slow down _too_ much—**thinking over an emotion for too long may extend and intensify your negative feelings.**
> 
> Goleman asserts that this kind of rumination is a particularly common risk when you’re trying to combat _sadness_—even if you’re following Holiday’s advice. According to Goleman, we feel sad when we lack or have lost something important to us. With this definition in mind, Holiday would recommend adjusting your unrealistic expectations of what you need to be happy—becoming comfortable with what you lack instead of mourning what you think you “should” have. However, Goleman would temper this advice and warn that **if you’re constantly reminding yourself to be happy with what you lack, frequently thinking about it may make you sadder.**
> 
> Similarly, mental exercises such as Holiday’s self-interview and objective reframing may make you sadder by forcing you to dwell on whatever is making you sad: Self-interview requires you to “talk” with yourself at length about the thing that’s making you sad, while even pretending a sad event happened to your friend forces you to _think_ about that event. Instead, Goleman recommends intentionally planning pleasant distractions to combat sadness. Evidence shows that sad people gravitate toward activities that are more likely to make them sadder, so it’s important to force yourself to do something that will actually lift your spirits: For example, watch comforting TV, draw a hot bath, or exercise.
> 
> Alternatively, Goleman recommends engineering a small victory for yourself, something to be proud of: For instance, organize your closet, finish a book, or buy a gift for a friend.

### Strategy #2: Redirect Your Emotions Into Helpful Contexts

While slow, logical reasoning will help take the edge off many of your unhelpful emotions, it’s unlikely they’ll go away completely. In this case, **Holiday recommends you transform your emotions into a form that serves you**. In particular, when unfair circumstances or pointless constraints frustrate you, Holiday suggests you use that anger as fuel instead of allowing it to make you reckless.

Anger is a double-edged sword—while it gives you energy and motivation to accomplish your goals, it can also push you to take impulsive actions that end up doing you harm. Holiday argues that the way around this dilemma is to **use your calm, rational mind to decide where to commit your energy, then allow yourself to act wildly and impulsively within that context.** For example, a frustrated painter may act calmly and deliberately when marketing their art and deliberately choose to channel all their anger regarding their career into explosive emotion on the canvas.

> **Sublimation: Does Science Back It Up?**
> 
> The process Holiday describes here—using your unhelpful emotions to motivate constructive action—[is known in psychology as sublimation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sublimation). Sigmund Freud introduced this concept into the public vocabulary. Although [the majority of Freud’s hypotheses have been discredited](https://www.livescience.com/why-freud-was-wrong.html), the concepts of sublimation and similar psychological defense mechanisms have endured.
> 
> Psychologists have conducted little empirical research on the subject of sublimation. However, one notable study [found a correlation between suppressed anger and creative success](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0033487), as Holiday would have predicted. Experimenters tasked a group of Protestants with making art in various media, including sculptures, poetry, and collages, to see whether Protestants engaged in sublimation more than people from other religious groups. A panel of judges rated the experimental group’s artwork as markedly better than a control group when they were either forced to suppress feelings of anger or prompted to feel “unacceptable” sexual desires. This result shows that people are capable of sublimating unwanted emotions into productive pursuits, as Holiday recommends.

### Strategy #3: Prepare for Long-Term Hardship

The previous two strategies we’ve discussed to manage your emotions work well for short bursts of discipline. However, Holiday argues that to live a virtuous life, you need something far more powerful than temporary strength of will: You need resilience woven into your DNA as a permanent feature of your character. The Stoics called it the “Inner Citadel”—a secure space you build within yourself that’s invulnerable to any external stress.

Holiday points out that most modern people don’t have this kind of long-term resilience because our powerful technology lulls us into thinking we can control everything that happens around us—we forget that life is unpredictable. As a result, this lifestyle built around comfort is _fragile_. When things inevitably fall apart, we’re likely to become emotional wrecks and may give up on pursuing a virtuous life. Long-term strength of character allows us to conquer and ultimately find happiness in a world of disorder and uncertainty.

Holiday asserts that **it’s possible to build this kind of emotional strength with practice over time.** Decide where you need to go and resolve that you will do anything it takes to get there, no matter what obstacles get in your way—then do it again.

> **A More Pleasant Path to Resilience**
> 
> Holiday’s advice on how to cultivate perseverance can be boiled down to “Toughen up and do it.” On the other hand, in _[Grit](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit)_, Angela Duckworth [advocates for a gentler path to resilience](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit/part-2-1), one that doesn’t require as much sheer willpower.
> 
> Duckworth defines “grit” as the intersection of perseverance and passion—it’s **applying Holiday’s concept of long-term resilience to a specific, consistent goal**. People with grit can weather a great amount of pain to achieve their purpose. Developing grit, however, is easier than just muscling through the pain, as Holiday makes it out to be. Instead, Duckworth asserts that you can develop grit in stages, initially pursuing something _fun_ that interests and gratifies you, then practicing to achieve superiority, and finally merging your skill with an altruistic purpose. In other words, **resilience develops naturally as you pursue satisfying goals**.
> 
> Duckworth would argue that once you reach this stage of purpose and mastery, you won’t even want to live the fragile life of technology-swaddled comfort Holiday warns about. You’ll be [instinctively drawn to big selfless goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit/part-2-3) and will derive pleasure from overcoming challenges. In contrast to the Stoic ethos of “rationality over passion,” Duckworth frames the path to resilience as the natural blossoming of innate human potential.

### Strategy #4: Take Things Step-by-Step

Holiday argues that the best way to tackle any fearsome problem or obstacle is to break it down and just focus on finishing one step at a time. Do the first step well, then move on to the next step and the next. Don’t think about the end goal, just what you have to do now. Holiday insists that **there’s no problem too big to solve** when broken down into discrete to-do items.

Holiday asserts that breaking a problem down into steps has a number of benefits: First, when you have a plan to follow, problems feel less daunting—each step is a psychologically manageable task that you can work up the courage to complete. Second, a step-by-step process prevents you from feeling lost or getting distracted. It points you in the right direction and ensures you’re continuously making progress. Lastly, a specific plan reminds you that it's up to you, and only you, to take action.

> **Crossing the Desert: This Requires Faith**
> 
> In _[Eat That Frog!](https://shortform.com/app/book/eat-that-frog)_, Brian Tracy [illustrates this same step-by-step strategy with an anecdote](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/eat-that-frog/chapters-9-10): Over a thousand people a year die traveling through the Tanezrouft, one of the most desolate areas of the Sahara desert, because blowing sand obscures the trail, causing travelers to get lost. To solve this problem, French colonists placed large black barrels every five kilometers along the trail, allowing Tracy himself to cross the deadly plain by _focusing on reaching one barrel at a time._
> 
> With this illustration, Tracy highlights an insight that’s missing from Holiday’s discussion of the step-by-step strategy: **When a task reaches a certain size, it becomes impossible to plan out the entire process ahead of time.** When your plan involves unknown variables or complex moving parts, the only thing you can do is take the first step and have faith that the next step will reveal itself to you.
> 
> The benefits of a step-by-step plan outlined by Holiday still apply in this modified approach: A short-term to-do item will still feel manageable, even if you don’t know where it will lead. Second, as long as you have a single goal to move toward, you won’t feel lost. Lastly, a way to move forward into the unknown forces you to stay accountable by preventing you from using the excuse of an uncertain process to avoid moving toward your goal.

### Strategy #5: Motivate Yourself by Helping Others

Building up your tolerance for long-term hardship and taking things step-by-step are helpful strategies to conquer obstacles over a long period. Zooming out to an even longer timeframe, Holiday’s next two strategies involve _sources of motivation_ intended to power you through an infinite number of obstacles.

The first such source of motivation is the satisfaction of helping others. Holiday argues that **working to solve the problems of others is one of the most effective ways to solve our own problems**.

Holiday notes that in challenging times, we tend to narrow our perspective and focus on ourselves, desperate to find a way to escape pain and fear. But **our instincts of self-preservation sabotage us by making it more difficult to see events objectively**. When we’re only looking out for ourselves, we interpret everything that happens as good or bad for us instead of neutral, as they really are. As we’ve previously established, these subjective judgments cause the majority of our suffering.

On the other hand, Holiday asserts that **by turning our attention outward and helping others, we can tap into an unlimited source of motivation and strength**. Active service to others will renew you with a sense of purpose and self-worth, and you can seize this greater purpose anytime, anywhere. Negative emotions like anxiety and self-pity fade away when you discover a way to move forward and do good.

> **Helping Others Unconditionally Is the Key to Happiness**
> 
> While Holiday frames the feeling of contribution to others as a source of motivation to achieve your virtuous goals, in _[The Courage to Be Disliked](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-courage-to-be-disliked/1-page-summary)_, Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga [make the more extreme argument that these feelings of contribution are the essence of all happiness](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-courage-to-be-disliked/1-page-summary#happy-people-aim-to-help-others). However, they add the caveat: You need to help others _unconditionally_ to be happy, asking nothing in return—not even gratitude.
> 
> Kishimi and Koga assert that happiness is based on self-worth—whether or not you think you’re a “good person.” They argue that most people base their self-worth on external approval, using the praise of others as evidence that they’re “good” enough. For example, a child builds self-worth by getting good grades to earn their parents’ approval, then grows up and gets a fancy corporate job to earn the approval of their larger culture.
> 
> However, Kishimi and Koga argue that this reliance on the approval of others is ultimately unfulfilling. If you need people to recognize how good you are, you’ll inevitably be unhappy whenever you’re denied this recognition.
> 
> Holiday makes the point that worrying only about yourself hurts you by making it difficult to see events neutrally. Kishimi and Koga would agree, arguing that **by seeking recognition, you’re only concerned about yourself even when you’re helping others**. Even if you spend your entire life doing good, you won’t be happy if you’re doing it for external approval.
> 
> Kishimi and Koga conclude that to find lasting happiness, you need to base your self-worth on contributing to the world in the way you think is best, even if no one approves or appreciates your actions. When you do this, people with different values—perhaps even family members—will dislike you, but to be happy, you need to work up the courage to be disliked.

### Strategy #6: Accept Things for What They Are

Holiday’s final strategy to master your emotions, and, as we’ll see, a major source of motivation, is to accept things for what they are. He explains that Stoics divide everything in the world into two categories: what is in our control and what is outside our control. Some aspects of life are impossible to change—for instance, the actions of others, or a tragedy that has already happened. Holding an emotional grudge against a reality you can’t change will only make it more difficult to achieve your goals. Instead, peaceably accept things for what they are.

This isn’t the same as giving up—Holiday makes it clear that accepting something that’s impossible to change doesn’t require losing hope. On the contrary, it’s only after accepting the constraints you’re given that you can channel your energy and attention into alternative ways to achieve your goals. There are always paths leading forward, but you won’t be able to see them if you refuse to abandon dead ends.

You don’t have to like something to accept it—just face facts. Holiday insists that once you do so, you’ll often be able to embrace their upsides. **By accepting constraints as a fact of life, you can use them to become a better person.** Once-disheartening roadblocks may push you to develop new skills or teach you valuable lessons for the future.

> **Accepting Unhelpful Thoughts**
> 
> In _[The Happiness Trap](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-trap)_, Russ Harris explains how readers can use something called “Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,” or “ACT,” to find happiness in their lives. Harris uses the same rationale as Holiday to support his advice: We should focus on what we can control and peaceably accept whatever is out of our control. Harris, however, [gets more specific than Holiday, applying this logic to negative thoughts.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-trap/principle-2) Just as Holiday suggests you accept unpleasant constraints you can’t change and focus on paths leading forward, **Harris suggests you accept thoughts that don’t serve you and focus on thoughts that do.**
> 
> Harris explains that by recognizing that negative thoughts are merely words and images that may or may not reflect reality, you’ll no longer see them as threats or mandates. Instead, you’ll see them as _suggestions_, some helpful, some unhelpful. **If a negative thought pushes you toward something you can change, it’s helpful, and you should act on it.** If it pushes you toward something you can’t change, you need to _accept it and ignore it_.
> 
> Some negative thoughts are useful. For example, if you feel bad that you forgot your spouse’s birthday, this unpleasant feeling can motivate you to be more caring and attentive in the future. On the other hand, some negative thoughts are unhelpful. For example, thinking the vague statement “I’m a bad person” doesn’t direct you toward anything constructive. In this case, Harris recommends you make space for the feeling and allow it to pass.
> 
> This is a perfect example of Holiday’s perspective on acceptance in action: Accepting unhelpful negative thoughts doesn’t mean giving up and remaining unhappy—on the contrary, it frees you to take advantage of the negative thoughts that can help you become a happier person. In short, accepting and ignoring the things you can’t change allows you to focus your actions where they can make a difference.

#### Celebrate Everything That Happens

Once you’ve learned to peacefully accept whatever is beyond your control, Holiday argues you should take it one step further and learn to _celebrate_ disasters. **Tragic events are inevitable, but your emotional response to them is largely under your control—why not find a way for them to make you happy?** Holiday is adamant that the opportunities hidden within any tragedy are more than enough to justify gratitude and celebration.

Additionally, Holiday argues that **finding and embracing the good within the bad is your ultimate source of motivation.** If you claim it, no obstacle can ever wear you down. Stay upbeat in all situations—act as if anything that happens is the best thing that could have happened.

> **The Origin of _Amor Fati_: Eternal Recurrence**
> 
> Holiday refers to this sentiment as _amor fati_, a Latin phrase meaning “love of fate.” Although the ancient Stoics Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius [were the first to express the idea of celebrating everything that happens](https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/), the phrase _amor fati_ [was coined by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his book The Gay Science (1882)](https://www.thoughtco.com/nietzsches-idea-of-the-eternal-recurrence-2670659).
> 
> While Holiday frames _amor fati_ primarily as a source of motivation to accomplish your goals, Nietzsche presents the idea as the guiding principle of a great life. He first arrives at the concept of _amor fati_ through a thought experiment: [the hypothetical situation of “eternal recurrence.”](https://www.thoughtco.com/nietzsches-idea-of-the-eternal-recurrence-2670659) What if, after death, you had to live your life over again an infinite number of times in exactly the same way? Nietzsche [concludes that the ideal thing to do in this situation would be to face life with amor fati](https://iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/#H7)—if your life is already predetermined, the only way you could improve your life is by choosing to celebrate tragedy, just as Holiday describes.
