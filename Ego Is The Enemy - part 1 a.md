## Part 1A: Attaining Success: How to Think

Holiday argues that ego can prevent you from achieving your dreams by leading you to incorrect ways of thinking that prevent success. He contends that unfortunately, many of us are taught these incorrect ways of thinking starting in childhood: Our parents, teachers, and other adults teach us that having a high self-esteem is the first step to leading a happy and fulfilled life. Further, we’re taught that we’re entitled to have a big ego whether or not we’ve accomplished anything that would merit such confidence.

Unfortunately, these beliefs about confidence and ego are mistaken. Self-esteem must be based on true achievement for it to be a positive (and controlled) part of our lives. Confidence based on nothing but validation is imaginary and leads to an inflated ego that gets in the way of happiness and success.

> **Is Self-Esteem Harmful?**
> 
> Psychologists have long noted the danger of raising your kids with constant [self-esteem-building messages like “you’re so smart.”](https://loudounnow.com/2019/03/21/mcnerney-dont-tell-your-kids-they-are-smart/) Some psychologists even argue that [self-esteem—confidence in your worth or abilities—is inherently harmful to your psyche](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anxiety-another-name-pain/202001/the-myth-self-esteem). They argue that self-esteem implies value comparisons: It defines you as either “better than” or “lesser than” other people, which puts you in a judgmental mindset. Further, if your sense of value is dependent on peoples’ opinions of you (including your own opinion of yourself), it’s not stable, but instead will rise and fall as peoples’ opinions change.
> 
> While Holiday agrees that confidence based on validation and opinion is unstable and dangerous, some psychologists go further to say that even confidence based on achievement is dangerous, because it’s predicated on your success, and liable to disappear if your achievements fail. It can also lead to negative traits like perfectionism and anxiety. Instead, these psychologists advise you to [focus on self-acceptance](https://positivepsychology.com/self-acceptance/#:~:text=Its%20close%20cousin%2C%20self%2Desteem,you%20are%20who%20you%20are.), rather than self-esteem or confidence.

Holiday argues that to control your ego’s influence over your thoughts, you need to:

- Stop talking about yourself.
- Stop thinking about yourself.
- Stop being prideful.

### Stop Talking About Yourself

Holiday notes that ego often drives people to talk about and promote themselves. We see this kind of egotistical “talk” every day, as people post their thoughts, activities, and interactions with other people all over social media.

People do this because they naturally like validation from others, and because it’s fun to talk about goals. Therefore, people striving for a goal often post news and thoughts about it—writers, for example, are famous for tweeting their progress (or lack thereof) on their current novel.

Holiday warns that this type of self-promoting talk can prevent you from achieving the very things you’re bragging about because talk replaces _action_, and action is what’s actually going to make you successful. Self-promoting talk keeps us from our goals by:

- Wasting valuable time
- Sapping our psychological energy
- Preventing the silence needed for productive reflection

> **The Stoic View on Self-Interest and Self-Promotion**
> 
> Holiday bases his theories on Stoic philosophies, many of which were originally outlined in the letters of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (collected as _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations)_). Aurelius argues:
> 
> - Fame has no value because it’s just people knowing about you, and when those people who know about you die, your fame fades away and nothing meaningful is left. In the meantime, all fame does is make you feel better about yourself—again, creating nothing of value.
>     
> - Material wealth has no value because materials can’t reach your soul—only characteristics like courage and discipline touch your soul.
>     
> 
> Overall, Stoicism encourages you to be _emotionally indifferent_ to the trappings of success like wealth, power, and fame. Therefore, some people argue that Stoicism doesn’t allow for the pursuit of things like wealth and fame, as these are emotion-driven desires, and it discourages self-promotion, as this is part of chasing the trappings of success.
> 
> However, Holiday approaches Stoicism as a means to an end. He believes, as many other Stoic thinkers believe, that the purpose of Stoicism is to [help people live great lives through wisdom](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/#who-were-the-stoic-philosophers), and that Stoic philosophy doesn’t forbid personal gain as long as those gains don’t interfere with living an ethical life—or even better, as long as the gains help _promote_ ethical living.
> 
> For example, if your ethical life involved becoming the CEO of an organization that makes a positive contribution to society, Stoics would argue that it is acceptable for you to chase that position even though it furthers your own self-interest, because it also is part of living an ethical life.
> 
> Therefore, Holiday seems to believe that Stoic ideals allow for people to desire things like wealth and fame as long as these are not overpowering desires. After all, many followers of Stoicism have risen to great heights of wealth and fame (including, of course, its most famous follower, Marcus Aurelius), and much of Holiday’s own success has come about because of self-promotion. Overall, then, while Holiday advocates tempering your ego in order to find success, he doesn’t advocate swearing off success, or the things that come with it, completely.

#### Self-Promoting Talk Wastes Valuable Time

Holiday notes that there are a fixed number of hours in each day, and **when you _talk_ about working toward something instead of _actually_ working toward it, you rob your goals of the time needed to achieve them and allot that time instead to nonproductive activities.**

Sometimes, you might rationalize the time you spend on self-promotion by telling yourself that self-promotion is actually an important part of the process. Unfortunately, when you do this, you misunderstand the order of priority: Self-promotion is necessary, but only when you have something to promote. Self-promotion _before_ you’ve achieved your goals is just procrastination. Instead of spending your limited time and energy on self-promotion, work quietly and diligently toward your goals—this is the only activity that will actually bring you success.

> **Controlling Your Ego Leads to Better Time Management**
> 
> Management experts recognize time management as one of the most important elements of success—if you can’t complete a project, you won’t reach your goals. Further, if you can complete more in any given amount of time, you’ll reap more benefits: more money, more leisure time, and so on.
> 
> In his book _[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people)_, Stephen Covey explores different techniques for improving your time management skills. He notes that while time-management advice once centered around checklists and calendars, more recent thinking centers around [prioritizing which tasks and activities will serve your long-term goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/habit-3) and eliminating any others from your daily schedule. This means you should focus more on managing your _goals_ rather than managing your _time_—in Covey’s words, you should _schedule your priorities_ rather than _prioritize your schedule._
> 
> Through this lens, what Holiday is really doing is advising us to figure out what activities will move us toward success, to realize that self-promotion is not one of them, and to therefore eliminate it from our daily schedule.

#### Self-Promoting Talk Saps Your Psychological Energy

Holiday points out that studies show self-promotion can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, self-promotion acts as a sort of visualization, which can be a powerful psychological tool: When you picture yourself and speak about yourself as if you were successful, you can convince your subconscious mind that you _are_ successful, which can prompt you to act in successful ways.

On the other hand, too much visualization can actually have the opposite effect: **After a certain point, your subconscious mind confuses visualization with actual progress.** If you talk about, think about, and explain a project long enough, you begin to feel you’re closer to achieving it, even though you may not have taken any actual, measurable steps toward your goal. It _feels_ like you’ve been productive if you’re spent five hours talking about something—but you haven’t, and you may not have any psychological energy left to take actual action.

Holiday cites the example of the writer Upton Sinclair, who decided to run for Governor of California in 1934. In an unusual method of self-promotion, Sinclair published a short book called _[I, Governor of California, and How I Ended Poverty: A True Story of the Future](https://www.worldcat.org/title/i-governor-of-california-and-how-i-ended-poverty-a-true-story-of-the-future/oclc/338642)_. The book outlined—_in the past tense_—all the policies he’d enacted as governor, as if he were looking back on a successful, productive term. As noted by friends of his around that time, he then promptly lost all interest in the campaign. It was as if his own self-promotion had convinced him he’d done the hard parts, and there was no need to keep trying, and he lost the election by a significant margin.

> **Visualization Can’t Entirely Account for Sinclair’s Failure**
> 
> Holiday’s discussion of Sinclair’s campaign ignores some aspects of the situation that might not support his theories. While it may certainly be true that Sinclair lost enthusiasm for his campaign after he published his book, [his defeat was probably sealed by other factors](https://depts.washington.edu/epic34/campaign.shtml).
> 
> Sinclair was a long-time member of the Socialist party. He changed his party membership to Democrat when he ran for governor in order to have a more mainstream appeal, but the ideas he set forth in his book were solidly socialist, and even communist. For example, he called for the government to take over private farms and movie studios and run them as worker-led co-ops. His plans were so radical that he didn’t garner the full support of his party, and even President Roosevelt refused to endorse him.
> 
> Additionally, it might be argued that Sinclair’s exercise in self-promotion and visualization was actually successful. Though his ideas were too extreme to propel him to an elected seat, some resonated with the public and are credited with influencing many New Deal policies. Given that Sinclair was a writer first and foremost, it’s even possible that his book fulfilled his true ambition of spreading influential ideas, and that his goal of becoming governor was outside the scope of the larger cause he was working for.
> 
> Regardless, the example does illustrate Holiday’s argument that too much visualization can destroy your energy for a project—even if, in this case, there were probably other, additional factors that brought about that outcome.
> 
> **Negative Visualization May Be More Useful**
> 
> Holiday’s theories that visualization can sap your energy levels are supported by science. Researchers examining the effects of visualization on goal achievement have found that when subjects used positive visualization techniques for a goal they wanted to accomplish, [they lost energy for that goal](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/positive-fantasies-about-idealized-futures-sap-energy) and were less likely to achieve it. This effect held true even if the subjects were simply visualizing positive things that might happen in the coming week: After visualizing, they accomplished less during the week.
> 
> **In contrast, subjects who either visualized negative things or thought about the possibility that they might not achieve their goal had higher energy and accomplished more afterward.**
> 
> The researchers hypothesize that visualizing a positive outcome has a relaxing effect on the body (one way they measured their subjects’ reactions was by tracking their systolic blood pressure, a useful proxy for either relaxation or anxiety). For this reason, psychologists sometimes use positive visualization techniques to help anxious patients relax. However, if your goal is to accomplish something that requires energy and action, such relaxation techniques can be counterproductive.

#### Silence Allows for Action

Holiday proposes that to properly struggle with a task, you must _pause_ and focus your attention on that problem completely. If you fill that pause with talk, you distract yourself—you deny yourself the opportunity to properly focus.

But if you allow for silence, your mind starts the true work of wrestling with the challenge you face. This is why people who achieve great things often don’t broadcast what they’re working toward until they’re well on their way. Holiday points to Bo Jackson, the baseball and football player, as an example. While at Auburn University, Jackson set for himself the goal of winning the Heisman Trophy and being the first pick in the NFL draft. He told no one but his girlfriend of these goals. His silence on the matter allowed him to focus on the goals themselves, and he went on to achieve them.

> **Silence Promotes Action**
> 
> Research also backs up Holiday’s assertions here. Studies show that when people announce goals, [they develop a premature sense of having accomplished them](https://s18798.pcdn.co/motivationlab/wp-content/uploads/sites/6235/2019/02/gollwitzer-et-al-2009-when-intentions-go-public.pdf), and they’re less likely to actually follow through and achieve those goals. This is similar to the research that shows positive visualization saps psychological energy—talking about a goal is another way of visualizing it.
> 
> Allowing for silence is also similar to meditating, which brain scans show have [measurable effects on a person’s ability to focus](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/you-illuminated/201204/brain-scans-show-how-meditation-improves-mental-focus). Holiday doesn’t address meditation, but there’s a link between the benefits of silence and those of meditation: Cutting back on self-talk frees up time during your day when you can instead sit quietly and think. Whether you go so far as to meditate, the quietness and freedom from distractions will help with your focus.
> 
> **An Objection to Holiday’s Example**
> 
> While Holiday’s theory is sound, his example of Bo Jackson demonstrates an aspect of his book that some readers have criticized—Holiday leaves out so much context that he fails to draw a convincing connection between Jackson’s humility and his success. For example, he doesn’t explain _how_ Jackson’s humility led to his success, nor does he discuss any other Heisman trophy winners or successful football players, many of whom may have openly discussed their ambitions. In other words, he shows _correlation_ between Jackson’s humility and his success but he fails to draw a solid line of _causation_.
> 
> This logical flaw doesn’t nullify Holiday’s theories. But it does point to the fact that success is rarely an outcome of one character trait in particular, and is rarely divorced from other influences. For example, in her book _[Grit](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit/1-page-summary)_, Angela Duckworth proposes that grit—essentially, the personality trait of conscientiousness that relates to perseverance, hard work, and goal-setting—is more responsible for success than any other personal trait. Although she doesn’t discuss Bo Jackson in particular, Holiday’s description of Jackson’s work ethic (focusing on his goals without the distractions of ego) indicates that he had plenty of grit.
> 
> Again, this doesn’t mean that Holiday’s theories are incorrect—it’s possible that a combination of humility and grit led to Jackson’s success, and even that his lack of ego led him to be grittier. But it does show the limitations of his arguments as presented. Holiday’s tendency to direct his readers attention to certain aspects of his examples while ignoring others is a common technique among management and self-help books.

### Stop Thinking About Yourself

In addition to not _talking_ about yourself, Holiday advises that you not _think_ about yourself either. He cautions that ego can prompt self-aggrandizing thoughts, leading you to spend more time thinking about what you’ll do with success than on how you’ll achieve it. For example, you might spend hours imagining yourself giving an acceptance speech, or planning how you’d spend your wealth once you’ve earned it, instead of thinking about the challenges in front of you that will lead you to that success. Everyone indulges in these thoughts from time to time, but when they monopolize your time, they prevent you from thinking productively about your goals.

Holiday outlines three ways that egotistical thoughts can paralyze you:

- **They shift your focus from your task to your “greatness.”** When you’re convinced of your own greatness, you’re more concerned with defending that image than completing your task. For example, the Civil War General George McClellan—widely acknowledged to be possibly the worst general in the Union army—was so inflated with unearned confidence (ego) that he spent all his time making grandiose plans and defending his lack of victories to his superiors. He focused on trying to convince the world of his legacy and neglected to actually earn his legacy by winning battles.
- **They stop you from taking action out of a fear that your plan must first be perfect.** When you have an inflated sense of self-importance, you might be reluctant to embark on a course of action that doesn’t live up to the standards you envision for yourself. For example, someone choosing between two career paths might get caught in paralyzing analysis because she fears choosing the “lesser” path that might not highlight her brilliance. Her hesitation and wavering might cause her to miss out on valuable job opportunities.
- **They erect a barrier between you and reality.** Again, General McClellan provides an example: Convinced of his own superiority, he ignored facts (grossly misjudging the size of his enemy’s army) and was consumed by imagined threats (such as nonexistent conspiracies from his allies). His inability to see reality instead of an imagined world in which his greatness saved the day led to resounding defeats by Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.

> **Early Success Can Lead to Paralyzing Ego**
> 
> In McClellan, Holiday picked an excellent example of someone whose outsized ego prevented him from operating effectively. McClellan was tapped by Union leaders because he’d fought in the Mexican-American War, he had a background in railroads (which leaders felt would be logistically useful), and he was friends with some powerful people. Largely because of his connections, he was promoted to lead the Union Army in 1861 even though he’d never actually led a battle up to that point.
> 
> Soon after his appointment (which he held for only four months due to his incompetence), he immediately began [dreaming of military and political glory and power](https://lincolnasgreatcommunicator.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mcclellan_to_wife.pdf)—in a letter he wrote to his wife, he claimed that if he’d wanted, he could become dictator “or anything else that might please me,” and he spoke of his hopes of winning medals and honors. He soon ran into conflicts with Abraham Lincoln and other leaders who asked him for details on his operations, accusing them of meddling—again allowing his ego to cloud his judgment.
> 
> We can see McClellan’s traits in our contemporary business world when eager young business people with solid connections and degrees from well-known universities find a measure of early success and then allow themselves to believe they are more important and more capable than they really are. [Many promising entrepreneurs have run into trouble](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278901) when, like McClellan, they refused to listen to advice, spent their time dreaming of glory, and over-estimated their own abilities.

### Stop Being Prideful

Holiday draws a connection between ego and pride. He points to pride as a particular problem because it interferes with your perception of reality. Pride inflates accomplishments, so that you feel like you’re winning when you’re in fact only temporarily ahead. Because of this, **pride is a type of fraud—it’s your ego lying to you about your situation.** When you can’t see the world clearly because you’re blinded by a prideful vision of yourself, you again can’t effectively interact with the world and achieve success.

Successful people are those who learn to control their pride. For example, industrial tycoon John D. Rockefeller made a habit of reminding himself every night that just because he was off to a good start didn’t mean he was truly successful. He would challenge himself to not lose balance and to not be a fool, lest he lose his head—and then his fortune.

(Shortform note: Here, Holiday references a wealthy, powerful person (J.D. Rockefeller) as an example of someone with a Stoic mindset. If you interpret Stoic philosophy as the rejection of material wants, this might seem counterintuitive. However, Holiday’s overall point is that Stoic ideas are _tools_ to help you manage your thoughts and behaviors so that your ego doesn’t sabotage your success—he isn’t advising that you renounce all desire for worldly goods, but rather, that you don’t let those desires consume you.)

> **Pride Drives Poor Decisions**
> 
> There are many ways in which pride can blind you to reality and prompt you to make poor decisions and end up losing money. In his book _[A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-random-walk-down-wall-street)_, Burton Malkiel argues that [pride is a common reason that investors make mistakes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-random-walk-down-wall-street/chapter-11). For example, a trader might be proud if one of their stocks rises significantly in value and might decide to cash in that stock because they want to boast about such a good win. However, if doing so would incur capital gains taxes, then selling it might be a poor financial decision.
> 
> Malkiel also explores how pride blinds investors to reality by making them overconfident. This leads them to make mistakes like trading too frequently—investors who believe they can “beat the market” tend to trade more often and end up worse off because of it—and overvaluing stock that they’ve personally invested in, because they can’t see the possibility that they bet wrong.
