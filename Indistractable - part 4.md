## Part 4: Create Precommitments

The last part of the indistractable model focuses on locking yourself _into_ traction, rather than keeping distractions _out. **You accomplish this by using precommitments—choices you make while in an undistracted state that will help guide your behaviors when you’re tempted by distraction in the future.**_

- For example, you might precommit to saving money by setting up a portion of your paycheck to automatically deposit in your savings account, instead of believing you’ll make the right choice on payday.

Precommitments are the last piece of the indistractable model because their success depends on the first three elements:

- You must understand and manage your internal triggers. Otherwise, your internal discomfort will be strong enough to drive you away from your precommitments.
- You can’t fulfill a precommitment unless you set aside time in your schedule to do so.
- External triggers can easily pull you off task.

There are three types of precommitments that can minimize the power of distraction: effort pacts, price pacts, and identity pacts.

### Precommitment Type 1: Effort Pacts

**An effort pact is a precommitment that makes it _more difficult_ to do something _undesirable_.** This extra bit of difficulty gives you a moment to pause and ask yourself if the distraction is _really_ what you want to do

There are several ways you can use technology to create effort pacts for yourself.

- You can set apps, such as Self Control and Forest, to block certain websites when you need to focus. You must manually turn the app off if you want to visit a blocked site—the distraction becomes less tempting when it’s more than a click away.
- Apple has a time limit function that forces you to confirm your choice if you decide to spend more than the agreed-upon time on an app. You think twice about your behavior.

**Effort pacts are especially effective when you make them with _others_ because we’re inclined to mimic others’ actions and want to be seen doing the “right thing.”** Before smartphones and personal computers, these types of social effort pacts used to happen naturally in offices. If someone was slacking off, it was visible to the entire office—either they’d feel shame at being the odd one out or a colleague would shame them, and they’d get back on task. Today, it’s harder to see what people are doing all day, especially with the growing number of people working from home. Without natural social pressure to stay on task, you’ll have to look for ways to create social effort pacts, such as:

- Asking a colleague to be your accountability partner and regularly checking in on each other’s progress
- Asking a fellow WFHer to come work in your home office
- Joining a service like Focusmate, a video service that pairs people all over the world who need motivation to “show up” for work

### Precommitment Type 2: Price Pacts

**You already know that distraction costs you _time_—a price pact makes distraction’s cost more tangible with _money_.** In these pacts, you attach money to your precommitment as an incentive to stick with what you said you would do. If you do what you’re supposed to, you get to keep the money. If you don’t, you have to give up the money. The reason price pacts work so well is that people are more motivated by _loss aversion_ than they are by _potential gains_.

_The_ _New England Journal of Medicine_ published a study with three groups of smokers attempting to quit.

- Members of Group A, the control group, received educational resources and free nicotine patches to help them quit.
- Members of Group B were promised $800 if they stopped smoking within six months.
- Members of Group C made a precommitment—they gave $150 of their own money, along with a pledge to quit within six months. If they fulfilled their pledge, they’d receive their deposit of $150 and a $650 bonus.

The results showed success in 6% of Group A, 17% of Group B, and _52%_ of Group C. Although groups B and C received $800 total at the end of the study, Group C was exceptionally motivated because they risked _losing their own money._

**To create an effective price pact, attach a potential loss to distraction.** For example, Eyal wanted to stop skipping out on his exercise regimen but nothing was working for him. He then attached a $100 bill to his workout schedule and created a pact: If he missed a gym session, he would light the bill on fire. Every time he thought about skipping the gym, the tangible loss made him rethink it.

In addition to triggering our loss aversion, price pacts transform the way you think about the outcome of distraction—rather than a vague future concept of lost time or lost productivity, the outcome is tangible in the _present_.

- Imagine you wanted to finish your first draft of a book. You make a pact with a friend—you’ll give them $1,000 if you don’t finish by an agreed-upon date. Every time you think about skipping writing time, you’re faced with the thought of losing all that money. The fear of it gets you on task. On the other hand, trying to push through distraction by imagining potential disappointment wouldn't be so motivating.

#### Four Warnings About Price Pacts

Price pacts _can_ be exceptionally effective, but you have to be prepared for them. There are four warnings to consider:

**1) Price pacts don’t work if you can’t remove external triggers.** If you can’t circumvent external triggers that tempt you to become distracted, you won’t be able to find ways to stick to the pact—you’ll inevitably break it.

- For example, a price pact _can_ work for limiting social media use—you can turn off notifications, delete apps, and so on. It _can’t_ help you stop biting your nails—you can’t get rid of your hands (a trigger), so you’ll likely repeatedly break the pact and eventually render it meaningless.

**2) Price pacts are for short tasks.** They work best when you just need a short, sustained bit of motivation to go the gym, ride out a cigarette craving, or turn off social media for a few hours. If the pact is too long, it becomes a punishment rather than a motivation.

- For example, “I’m going to eat vegetables every day or give Paul $50” is too long-term and vague. Inevitably, you’ll come home after a long day of work to discover you don’t have any vegetables in the house. Either you break the pact, or the pact becomes a punishment as you resentfully drag yourself to the store. You could remedy this by creating a shorter task, such as, “I’ll buy three different vegetables every time I go to the store, or I’ll give Paul $50.”

**3) Starting your price pact _won’t feel good_.** You’ll resist making the pact or feel unsure about your decision if you finally do make the pact. Remember that you _should_ feel anxious about losing your money—if you didn’t feel uncomfortable about the pact, it wouldn’t motivate you.

**4) It’s crucial to be self-compassionate.** Changing your behavior or trying to hack your motivation isn’t an easy feat—you’ll experience setbacks and failures. It’s important to be kind to yourself in these moments.

- When you’re kind to yourself, you’re able to reflect on the reasons for your setback and make successful changes to your behaviors and methods.
- On the other hand, if you feel that you’re a failure or unable to change, you’ll exacerbate the internal discomfort that leads to distraction and the issue will worsen. If you’re prone to beating yourself up, a price pact might not be for you.

### Precommitment Type 3: Identity Pacts

Changing the way you see yourself can help you change your behaviors because you’ll naturally act like the person you believe yourself to be. **Identity pacts are a precommitment to the identity that aligns with who you want to be and what you want to do.** These pacts help you think about your self-image and your behaviors and align them in two ways.

#### 1. Changing Your Self-Image Changes Your Behaviors

You can make it more likely you’ll perform certain behaviors by changing the way you talk about—and see—yourself.

- For example, if you’re trying to start running every day, don’t think of yourself as someone who’s _trying_ to run more or _has_ to run every day. You’re more likely to stick to your exercise plan if you call yourself _a runner_ or someone who _runs_.

**This applies to cultivating indistractable habits and making them an integral part of your identity—think of yourself and talk about yourself as someone who _is_ indistractable when describing your behaviors:**

- You’re not someone who _can’t_ take quick breaks to check Instagram. You’re indistractable—you _don’t_ take quick breaks, but you _do_ schedule social media time.
- It’s not that you _can’t_ deal with distractions from your coworkers. You simply _don’t_ deal with them.

#### 2. Changing Your Behaviors Changes Your Self-Image

Cultivating identity also works in the opposite direction—you can change your _self-image_ by changing your _behaviors_. When you act in a way that’s aligned with the identity you want to have, you naturally see more of that identity in yourself.

_Rituals_ are a great way to foster indistractable behaviors—by continually sticking to planned activity and exhibiting self-control, you reinforce the idea that you’re an indistractable person.

- These rituals can be small, easily achievable parts of your day such as your bedtime skincare routine or washing your dishes before you start your work in the morning.
