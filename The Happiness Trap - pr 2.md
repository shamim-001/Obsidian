## Principle #2: Defusion

In the last chapter, you learned about the observing self, the part of your awareness that notices what you’re thinking, feeling, and doing.

In this chapter, you’ll learn about a mindfulness technique called _defusion_. Harris explains that, in ACT, mindfulness means being aware of our thoughts, feelings, and the world around us. **Defusion allows us to separate ourselves from our thoughts, which enables us to accept negative thoughts rather than being engulfed by them.**

To begin, we’ll define the concept of fusion (the opposite of defusion), then explain the process of defusion. Next, we’ll outline four defusion techniques that you can use to detach from negative thoughts. Finally, we’ll explain the goal of defusion within the context of ACT.

### Defining Fusion

**When you mistake your thinking self—the part of you that thinks, judges, and acts—as a direct reflection of reality, ACT says that you are in a state of “fusion” with your thoughts.** Let’s take a closer look at how fusion functions.

Harris reiterates that the thinking self operates primarily through thoughts and images.

A thought is a word or phrase that you experience within your mind. For instance, if you’re driving to the grocery store and the words, “I think I’ll take the expressway” pop into your head, those words are a thought.

An image is a picture, or an extended movie, that you experience within your mind. For example, if you visualized the Nike logo, your mental picture of the logo is an image.

Although thoughts and images are different, they often occur simultaneously in our minds.

> **The Interplay Between Thoughts and Images**
> 
> A study at Harvard found that [the relationship between words and images—the two main components of human thought—is even more complicated than is presented here](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/visual-images-often-intrude-on-verbal-thinking-study-says/). Not only do words and images occur simultaneously in thought, but visual images “intrude” into the mind even when our mode of thought is primarily verbal (or word-based). These images are less like movies and more like brief flashes, or interruptions, in the ordinary course of thought.
> 
> Researchers found more visual activation in people’s minds when they discussed—or imagined—things that were closer to them. By contrast, verbal activation occurred when the subjects discussed or imagined places, people, and things that were more distant. For instance, when a subject focused on a place they were familiar with, researchers found activation in the visual centers of the brain, but when they focused on a place farther away and less familiar, the subject’s thoughts were more word-based.

Harris asserts that we rely on the running commentary of our thoughts in order to live. **These words and images come together in our mind to tell us stories about who we are and our place in the world.** For instance, we would not be able to form judgments about good or bad, right or wrong, without input from our thinking self.

However, most of these stories are neither true nor false, Harris explains. They reflect our thinking self’s partial viewpoint of complex events (both in our minds and in the world around us) and they determine how we orient ourselves with respect to those events. When we accept these incomplete stories as reality, we are experiencing fusion.

For example, imagine that you’re late picking up your children from school. Your thinking self may think that it’s okay for you to speed (because everybody does it and the roads are fairly clear). Later, when you get a speeding ticket, your thinking self may think it’s unfair because you were simply trying to be a responsible parent. This is your partial viewpoint of the situation. From the officer’s perspective, you deserve the ticket simply because you were driving over the speed limit.

When we are experiencing fusion:

1. **We believe our thoughts are a direct reflection of reality.** For instance, if we make a mistake at work, we believe that our thought, “I’m an idiot,” is objectively true.
2. **We believe that our thoughts have great significance.**
3. **We believe we should do what our thoughts tell us to do.** For instance, in the speeding ticket example above, you may try to convince the police officer that the ticket is unfair—likely landing you in even more trouble.
4. **We believe our negative thoughts are threats** to us that need to be eliminated.

> Taken as a whole, our thinking self’s perspective of the world can be called a “worldview.” And not only are our worldviews flawed and partial interpretations of reality, but [our worldviews are also resistant to information that contradicts them.](https://theconversation.com/humans-are-hardwired-to-dismiss-facts-that-dont-fit-their-worldview-127168) For instance, people who believe that global warming is not real are likely to reject the scientific evidence of human-caused climate change.
> 
> Based on this information, fusion with our worldviews is a real danger, causing us to choose our thinking self’s stories over reality simply because those stories are familiar.

Harris notes that fusion isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, if you’re on a first date and you perceive that it’s going well, it’s unlikely you’d consider it a problem that you’re treating your pleasurable thoughts as reality.

But **fusion becomes a problem when it prevents us from living rich and meaningful lives.** Making matters worse, Harris cites research showing that about 80% of the thoughts we experience contain negative content. (Shortform note: We can easily connect this kind of thinking back to the concept of the happiness trap. When we identify too completely with our thoughts, any negative thoughts that we experience become threatening. So we try to eliminate them through control strategies, which creates new negative thoughts (with which we also “fuse”)—and the cycle continues.)

### The Process of Defusion: Taking a Step Back

Harris explains that the antidote to fusion is _defusion,_ or separating ourselves from our thoughts. Rather than taking our thinking self’s stories as the absolute truth, **through defusion, we harness the power of the observing self to take a step back from those stories and recognize them for what they are: only words and images.**

Harris calls defusion an “acceptance strategy” as opposed to a control strategy: You don’t have to like or agree with your thoughts in order to practice defusion—you simply have to accept them. Similarly, the goal is not to _eliminate_ our negative thoughts. If you practiced defusion with the goal of eliminating your negative thoughts, you would end up back in the happiness trap.

Instead, according to Harris, the goal of defusion is to acknowledge that our thoughts are stories the brain tells us in order to help us survive.

When we practice defusion:

1. **We recognize that our thoughts are merely words and images**, not reality. For instance, if we make a mistake at work, we recognize that our mind’s reaction (“I’m an idiot”) is simply a story produced by our brain rather than an objective fact. If somebody disagreed with this thought, we could accommodate their perspective.
2. **We believe that our thoughts only have significance if we judge them as useful to us.**
3. **We don’t believe we should do what our thoughts tell us to do**, or that we have any obligation to those thoughts beyond acknowledging they exist. In our speeding ticket example, we may have the thought that receiving the speeding ticket was unfair, only to accept the thought, and let the encounter with the police officer end amicably.
4. **We don’t _experience_ negative thoughts and images as threats**, because we understand that they’re only words and pictures. Accordingly, there’s no need to eliminate negative thoughts.

By practicing defusion and accepting your negative thoughts, Harris says, you live a richer life and experience the world more fully—rather than continually trying to eliminate negative thoughts and feelings through experiential avoidance.

> **Common Hurdles in Defusion**
> 
> Clinical psychologist and ACT trainer John T. Blackledge identifies [common problems](https://www.praxiscet.com/posts/defusion-how-overcome-five-common-pitfalls/) that people can experience when trying to apply defusion to their lives. He identifies these problems within the clinical context, where a professional therapist is leading a patient in ACT, but we can still take a look at the common issues to be prepared in our more personal practice.
> 
> - The idea of defusion can be a tough pill to swallow when we struggle with long-term, persistent negative thoughts: Since fusion causes us to take a thought as objective reality, persistent thoughts are even more ingrained as facts. Being told that we should defuse from such a thought might come across as being told that we need to accept that we can’t reliably interpret our own reality. In this case, we must remember that thought is _inherently_ an unreliable narrator—it’s not something that’s specific to us.
>     
> - The idea of defusion, taken to an extreme, can lead to a sense of meaninglessness. If thoughts are just thoughts, then what about the important thoughts that we have concerning our morals and ethics? It can seem as though we have to throw out the good with the bad. But Blackledge emphasizes that our core morals and values are shaped by our _direct experience_ of what’s meaningful in life, not merely a parade of thoughts.
>     
> - When we practice defusion, it can be difficult to separate our _factual_ thoughts from our _nonfactual_ thoughts. For instance, when describing an object, a factual description is “That object is made of steel.” But at other times, it may not be entirely clear whether a thought is factual (and therefore useful to you, even if it makes you feel bad). For example, describing yourself as “fat” carries a lot of cultural baggage in Western society, so the acknowledgement of the physical fact of fat on the body may blur into the nonfactual associations that fat carries with it. You can distinguish between the factual and nonfactual by asking yourself what a presumed statement of fact _means_ to you—this will give you a sense of the nonfactual elements that may be loaded into the factual description.

### Four Defusion Techniques

Now that you know what defusion is, Harris provides some simple ways to practice it. But first, he emphasizes the limits of these techniques:

1. As discussed, the goal of these defusion techniques is not to eliminate negative thoughts, but to acknowledge thoughts for what they are: stories your brain tells you in order to live.
2. The goal of these defusion techniques is not to make you feel good. You may have pleasant feelings while engaged in these techniques, but these feelings are incidental. It’s especially important not to mistake this incidental pleasure as the _goal_ of defusion, since that mentality would turn defusion into a control strategy—and send you right back into the happiness trap.
3. You may not always remember to perform these techniques exactly when you need them, but they are always available to you when you do recognize that you’re experiencing negative thoughts.
4. These techniques aren’t perfect and there’s no guarantee they will work 100% of the time. If you try them and find they aren’t working, try to use your observing self to observe yourself believing that your thoughts are a direct reflection of reality.
5. Finally, these techniques are intended for repeated use over time. Doing them once won’t be enough to train your observing self in the practice of defusion. But with enough practice, defusion should become something you can perform without these techniques.

> **ACT Requires Practice**
> 
> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is, above all, a practical approach to mental health and well-being. While understanding the principles of ACT may bring you some clarity and offer potential avenues forward, direct and repeated action is the only path toward psychological flexibility, the ability to acknowledge and productively deal with difficult thoughts and feelings.
> 
> Thus, it’s essential to apply these techniques in your everyday life. They take little time to practice—from 30 seconds to five minutes a pop—and arm you with permanent tools for dealing with unwanted thoughts. It’s a good time investment.

#### Technique #1: Distancing

The first technique Harris describes aims to **train your observing self to notice the thoughts of your thinking self _as thoughts_ rather than as reality.** Follow these steps to practice distancing:

1. Pick a powerful negative thought that you struggle with regularly.
2. Take a moment and really _believe_ the story that your thinking self is telling you. Observe yourself in a state of fusion with that thought.
3. Now, try rephrasing the thought in your head by prefacing it with this phrase: “My brain is having the thought that…” For example, if your original thought was “I’m never going to succeed,” the rephrasing of that thought would be: “My brain is having the thought that I’m never going to succeed.”

You can experiment with this technique by adding more layers of separation to the beginning of the thought. For instance, you could rephrase your original thought this way: “My observing self is noticing that my brain is having the thought that I’m never going to succeed.”

> **The Labeling Technique**
> 
> A variation on the distancing technique is called [the labeling technique](https://washingtoncenterforcognitivetherapy.com/cognitive-defusion/). Both exercises help you train your observing self to practice defusion.
> 
> First, take a powerful recurrent negative thought and label it as either _descriptive_ or _evaluative_. If a thought is descriptive, it derives from the five senses and can be independently verified. For instance, this thought is descriptive: “She has brown hair.” If a thought is evaluative, it extends beyond the senses into the realm of abstract evaluation. For example, this thought is evaluative: “She is beautiful.”
> 
> As with the distancing technique above, labeling creates a distance between your thoughts and reality. Rather than adding layers of language between you and the thought, you’re adding a layer of judgment.

#### Technique #2: Cartoon Characters

Harris’s next technique requires you to imagine a cartoon character saying your thoughts. **Putting your thinking self’s commentary in another voice makes it easier to recognize that your negative thoughts are only sequences of words** loosely bound together—and that helps you dissociate from those thoughts.

1. Pick a powerful negative thought that you struggle with regularly.
2. Observe yourself in a state of fusion with that thought.
3. Now, try imagining a cartoon character with a distinctive voice saying the negative thought. For instance, imagine Donald Duck saying, “You’re never going to succeed.”

> **The “Say It Slowly” Technique**
> 
> An alternative to this technique is called [the “say it slowly” technique](https://www.sydney.edu.au/content/dam/students/documents/counselling-and-mental-health-support/cognitive-defusion.pdf). To practice this, pick a recurring negative thought and slow the thought down in your mind, taking time to stretch out the syllables and put extra space between the words.
> 
> Like the cartoon characters technique, the idea behind this exercise is that slowing down the pace at which a thought occurs and distorting it (almost as though you’re applying a voice filter to it) makes it more obvious that the thought is simply words you can speed up or slow down.

#### Technique #3: Thanking Your Mind

Harris’s third technique helps you **recognize that your thinking self’s running commentary is meant to keep you safe**—even if it’s not the absolute truth. To practice this:

1. Pick a powerful negative thought that you struggle with regularly.
2. Observe yourself in a state of fusion with that thought.
3. Express gratitude to your thinking self in whatever way you feel is appropriate. Just be sure the gratitude is heartfelt, not sarcastic.

If you struggle with this, remember that your thinking self is merely doing its best to keep you safe in a world it assumes poses many threats to your life. Even if you’re inconvenienced, hurt, or bothered by your brain’s attempts to keep you safe, acknowledge that it’s trying to work in your best interest. (Shortform note: In _[The Power of Now](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now)_, Eckhart Tolle argues that your ego (which Harris would call your thinking self) is _not_ acting in your best interest when it generates negative thoughts. Instead, Tolle says that [the ego manufactures problems and abstract fears](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/principle-2) in an effort to keep you engaged with it and prevent you from connecting with your true self (your observing self).)

> **The Pop-Up Mind Technique**
> 
> An alternative to thanking your mind is called [the “pop-up mind” technique.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/content/dam/students/documents/counselling-and-mental-health-support/cognitive-defusion.pdf) While thanking your mind reminds you that your thinking self is well-intended, this technique emphasizes that the nature of the thinking self is _automatic_. Just as a website automatically delivers pop-up ads to your computer, your thinking self delivers thoughts to your awareness. Rather than feeling that you absolutely must click on the ad, the exercise reminds you that you can simply choose not to engage.
> 
> Practicing this technique is fairly simple: Whenever you experience a negative or unwanted thought, imagine that the thought is an internet pop-up ad. Then, practice closing the ad.

#### Technique #4: Television Images

Unlike the previous techniques, this technique is specifically designed to help you process negative _images_, not negative _thoughts_. Harris writes that this practice helps you recognize that you can **radically recontextualize your painful image or memory until it loses its negative connotation** and becomes a picture next to a thousand other pictures—ultimately harmless.

1. Pick a powerful negative image, or sequence of images, that you often struggle with. Harris recommends limiting the scope of your chosen images to roughly 10 seconds in length.
2. Observe yourself in a state of fusion with this image.
3. Imagine the same image on a small screen. You can experiment with the image on the screen: Turn it black-and-white, fast-forward or reverse, make the image bigger or smaller, or imagine the image with a different set of colors.
4. Add a soundtrack to the image or memory. Experiment with a number of unique sounds. You might try bluegrass music for five seconds then switch to R&B.
5. Place the image in a new background or setting. For instance, you might start off outside of your childhood home, then the edge of an erupting volcano, then up into the clouds. The only limit is your imagination.

As a caveat, Harris advises that people who have traumatic histories and strong memories associated with trauma _should not use this technique on their own_. (Shortform note: In _[The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score)_, Bessel van der Kolk explains that certain [images and memories can trigger powerful flashbacks](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/chapter-3) in trauma survivors, and that the brain responds to flashbacks as intensely as if the danger were present in that moment.)

> **The Movie Theater Technique**
> 
> An adaptation of this technique is called [the “movie theater” technique.](https://www.philosophyforlife.org/blog/ten-defusion-techniques-for-unhooking-your-mind) Like the television images technique, this approach helps you to disengage from your images and memories by seeing yourself as a mere _viewer_.
> 
> First, imagine that your thinking self’s thoughts and images are a movie playing on the big screen at a theater. Allow yourself to “watch” the movie as it unfolds—each thought can be a character with its own motivations and flaws, and each image can be a still frame captured on the big screen. The important thing is to watch without judgment or involvement. For the time being, you’re merely a spectator.
> 
> Then, after about a minute of “watching” the movie, allow yourself to become aware of the beam of light from the projector that casts the images onto the screen. Raise your eyes from the movie and follow the beam of light to its source.

### The Goal of Defusion: Recognizing Helpful Thoughts

Now that you’re familiar with the concept of defusion and have a handful of techniques to practice, let’s consider the end goal of defusion.

After you’ve successfully defused a negative thought, the question becomes: What do you do with it?

**Harris advises asking, “Is this thought helpful?”** If yes, then the observing self gives you the power to allow that thought to guide you toward effective action. If no, then the observing self gives you the power to let the thought go and refocus your attention somewhere more helpful.

To see this process in action, let’s consider an example: Alyssa plans on meeting a friend at the bar for some drinks. Her friend arrives 15 minutes late because of traffic, and Alyssa yells at him. They argue, and her friend leaves.

Sitting at the bar afterward, Alyssa has the powerful negative thought, “I was a real jerk to my friend.” The thought is painful, so she defuses it. She takes a step back and remembers: It’s a painful thought, but it’s just a thought.

Now, she asks herself whether it’s a helpful thought. She decides that it is a helpful thought, because it can motivate her to reflect on her behavior (it was wrong to yell at her friend in public) and ensure that she doesn’t lose her temper in the future. She calls her friend and apologizes.

While some approaches that employ mindfulness techniques consider mindfulness an end in itself, ACT differs in the sense that it employs mindfulness as a means to an end. Specifically, **ACT uses mindfulness to facilitate actions that align with your values.**

> **How to Identify Helpful Thoughts**
> 
> One question that you might have is: How do I determine whether a thought is helpful?
> 
> One way to think about the question is to figure out what thoughts are for. In theory, thoughts serve any number of purposes—they can inform us, warn us, represent a situation (accurately or inaccurately), inspire us, motivate us, or discourage us. But whether a thought is helpful or not will always boil down to one thing: whether they align with our goals and values.
> 
> Later in _The Happiness Trap,_ Harris explains how to clarify your values and set goals. But meanwhile, you might consider asking yourself what your underlying motivations are as you move through the world. Are you trying to be a good person? What does that look like, specifically—being kind, being polite, being honest?
> 
> Once you’ve established some values and goals for yourself, you can determine whether a thought is helpful if it advances your goals and values. Even a potentially painful thought can advance one of your goals if acknowledging that painful thought makes it more likely that you’ll act in alignment with your goals in the future.
> 
> ACT doesn’t aim to eliminate suffering. Rather, it seeks to make the most of our suffering by either accepting that suffering and moving forward or using it productively to improve our lives.
