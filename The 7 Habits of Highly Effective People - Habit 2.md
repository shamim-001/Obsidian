## Habit 2: Envision the Life You Want

**Habit Description:**

- First, identify who you are, who you want to be, and what’s important to you.
- Second, keep these front of mind so that everything you do aligns with those principles.

### Why It Matters

Covey argues that **you have to imagine the life you want before you can achieve it.** Creating this vivid picture helps to keep you focused amid daily demands and distractions. In other words, you need a clear sense of your destination and direction to avoid being derailed by detours.

(Shortform note: While Covey’s point is fairly common sense—you can’t reach a destination you haven’t identified—Tony Robbins argues in _Awaken the Giant Within_ that focusing on your goals is more complex: It actually works both on a _subconscious_ and a _conscious_ level. First, Robbins writes that such focus [triggers a sort of radar](https://extension.umn.edu/two-you-video-series/ras) in a part of your brain called the Reticular Activating System, which directs your attention to resources and opportunities that can help you achieve those goals. Second, [inspiring and exciting goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-9) create motivation on a conscious level that pushes you to persevere in the face of challenges.)

### How To

The first aspect of this habit is identifying _who_ you want to be and _what_ you want to do. To crystallize this, Covey suggests an exercise to clarify what’s important to you from a long-term, big-picture perspective.

- Picture yourself at the end of your life or career. Visualize the scene in vivid detail.
- Imagine looking back on your life from that point; what kind of impact, legacy, and accomplishments do you hope to look back on?
- Use this insight to pinpoint the traits you want to embody and the things you want to achieve.

(Shortform note: While Covey suggests finding clarity by imagining yourself at the end of life and working backward, author and organizational psychologist Benjamin Hardy [advises doing the opposite](https://www.inc.com/benjamin-p-hardy/this-quick-mental-exercise-will-bring-you-immediat.html): Imagine what you’d do if you had only one month to live, but you couldn’t tell anyone about your prognosis. What if you had one year? Five years? His explanation suggests that the immediacy of deciding what you’d do with just one month highlights what’s most important, while expanding that vision to one year and then five years helps you clarify how to balance those values with necessary day-to-day logistics—for instance, maybe you could neglect work and only spend time with loved ones for a month, but not for five years.)

With this in mind, Covey recommends creating a personal mission statement (we’ll call it your personal manifesto to emphasize the passion behind it and the daily action it aims to inspire). This is a living document that encompasses _who_ you want to be and _what_ you want to do. **Your manifesto helps to keep you focused on your big-picture goals so that you can ensure all of your actions and decisions support that vision.**

Covey offers these tips for developing your own personal mission statement:

**1) Allow ample time.** Writing your manifesto requires deep introspection and careful thought, which can take weeks or months. Don’t rush, as the process is as important as the final result.

(Shortform note: Covey later published _[First Things First](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first/1-page-summary)_, in which he discusses personal mission statements in greater detail. He recommends [going on a personal retreat](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first/chapter-5) to write your manifesto, and doing the same annually to reassess and revise it.)

**2) Identify your core** (or, as Covey calls it, your center). This is the source of your identity, perspective, drive, and direction in life. Ideally, your core—like your perspectives—should be centered on universally accepted principles, like fairness and service to others. Principles provide consistent standards on which to base your identity and goals. However, many people have other values at their core, such as money, pleasure, or family; although these may seem like worthy values, their changing natures make them unstable centers, which creates chaos in your life. For example, if family is the core of your identity, then who do you become when your children move out of the house or you get divorced? (More on this in the “Going Deeper” section.)

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_, Robbins asserts that not only _knowing_ but also _[living by your values brings a sense of fulfillment](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-12)_, inner peace, certainty, and joy. By contrast, if you haven’t explicitly identified your values—such as love, success, and freedom—you may do things that conflict with these ideals and feel unhappy or frustrated without understanding why.)

**3) Identify your roles**, such as spouse, sibling, parent, friend, professional, and individual. If you don’t create your vision and goals to address each of your roles, you may focus your manifesto too heavily on one area of your life and neglect others.

(Shortform note: In _First Things First_, Covey argues that feeling unbalanced among your various roles is the biggest source of dissatisfaction in many people’s lives. For example, many people feel pulled between their work and their families. To find balance, he says that you must [stop compartmentalizing your roles](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first/chapter-6), and instead find ways to _integrate_ them. Granted, you can’t be in two places at once, but you can create an overall sense of balance in your life by recognizing your roles and proactively planning how to fulfill them all.)

**4) Create goals for each role.** Effective goals should focus on the end result you want, rather than how you’ll get there. Once you’ve identified your destination, then you can figure out a path to reach it.

(Shortform note: Goal-setting theory confirms that creating [specific, challenging goals improves performance.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232501090_A_Theory_of_Goal_Setting_Task_Performance) Psychologist Edwin Locke and organizational effectiveness professor Gary Latham, who developed the theory in the 1960s, asserted that specific goals (like “make 12 sales this week”) provide a concrete target, which often pushes people to achieve more than if they set a vague goal such as “close as many sales as possible”. )

**5) Regularly review and revise your manifesto** as your life, priorities, and circumstances change**.** Revising your manifesto ensures that it reflects such changes in your life and goals, while also allowing you to refine your approach; for instance, you may realize that one iteration of your manifesto puts too much emphasis on your professional life, so you revise to create more balance in your personal life.

> **Checklist of an Effective Personal Manifesto**
> 
> Personal manifestos are as unique as the people who write them. But, in _First Things First_, Covey lists several [characteristics that every manifesto should have](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first/chapter-5):
> 
> - It reflects a strong connection with your inner life and your best self.
>     
> - It recognizes and incorporates your unique talents.
>     
> - It guides you to contribute to a higher purpose beyond yourself.
>     
> - It addresses your physical, social, mental, and spiritual needs.
>     
> - It is grounded in universal principles.
>     
> - It incorporates your values (what kind of person you want to be) and your vision (what accomplishments do you want to make).
>     
> - It balances your personal, family, work, and community roles.
>     
> - It inspires you.
>     

Covey argues that, similarly, **organizations and even families should have group missions or manifestos.** In addition to keeping everyone on the same page about the group’s values and goals, these documents create a sense of unity and investment in the well-being of the group. For that reason, it’s critical that everyone in the group is involved in creating the manifesto, and that they share their thoughts about what matters to them and what they believe the group’s priorities should be.

> **Market Your Business With a Story, Not a Mission**
> 
> In his book _[Building a StoryBrand](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/building-a-storybrand)_, marketing expert Donald Miller argues that organizational _[stories are more easily digestible](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/building-a-storybrand/part-1)_ and attention-grabbing than mission statements, which makes them more effective at engaging and energizing consumers and employees. He presents a [formula for writing this story](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/building-a-storybrand/part-2), called the StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7):
> 
> - The _hero (customer) wants something_ and
>     
> - Encounters a _problem_ that stops her from getting it.
>     
> - She needs the help of a _guide (your brand)_ who has
>     
> - A _plan_ to help her solve the problem.
>     
> - The guide (brand) must _call on her to act_.
>     
> - The stakes must be clear—what does she stand to _lose if she doesn’t act_ and
>     
> - What she might _gain if she does act_?
>     

### Going Deeper

In the process of creating your personal manifesto, defining your core values is arguably the most abstract step, but it is also essential. Rather than being principle-centered, many people have cores like their marriage or work, which shape their identity and goals. However, as we’ll see, none of these “cores” leads to success as effectively as principle-centered manifestos.

To gain a better understanding of your core—in order to acknowledge and possibly shift it toward principles—review Covey’s descriptions of the most common centers and note which ones resonate with you. Since Covey argues that the only stable core is one centered in principle, he also lists the drawbacks of each of these common cores.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Core**|**Description**|**Drawbacks**|
|Family|You derive your security from the strength of your family traditions and reputation.|Your self-worth is vulnerable to others’ actions and external forces that are beyond your control.|
|Friend or Enemy|Paradoxically, these two cores are largely the same: Your interactions with other people, their opinions of you, and their treatment of you determine your sense of self-worth.|Your guiding force is how you think others will respond to your decisions, and you have no individual power because other people are determining your actions.|
|Work|Your identity is defined by your profession and position at work.|You’re likely to be a workaholic who sacrifices your relationships, health, and hobbies in the name of work.|
|Possessions|Your focus and self-worth are tied up in material possessions (e.g. cars and nice clothes) or intangible possessions (e.g. social status and authority).|Your self-worth depends on maintaining these possessions. It also rises and falls based on whether you’re around someone who has _more_ than you, making you feel inferior, or _less_ than you, making you feel superior.|
|Church|Whereas being _spiritually_-centered can guide you through inner examination and discovery, being _church_-centered emphasizes the appearance of being involved in the community, meeting social standards, and displaying your membership in the group.|You’re guided by how you think others will see you, rather than religious principles. You feel threatened by anything that jeopardizes your image or membership in the church.|
|Self|You’re primarily driven by what benefits you.|You’re driven more by selfishness than by an earnest attempt to develop and improve yourself.|

According to Covey, **your core determines your _experience_ more than the actual _outcome_,** and your experiences have a greater impact on your life than your specific actions. For instance, imagine that you’ve been invited to your cousin’s destination wedding and you’re conflicted about whether to go.

- If your core is family, you go because you feel it’s important to be at this family event and to celebrate your cousin. However, while you’re there you constantly check your work email and worry about what you’re missing in the office.
- If your core is money, you don’t go because the trip will break your budget. However, you resent that you’re missing out on all the fun.
- If your core is work, you don’t go because you feel that taking the time off will jeopardize the promotion you’re pursuing. However, you feel bad about missing your cousin’s big day.
- If your core is pleasure, you go because weddings are fun and you want to travel. However, while on the trip you worry about the money you’re spending.

Covey notes that, in contrast, if you’re principle-centered, you weigh your options and decide which action best aligns with your principles. In the example, a principle-centered decision may be to go, not to go, or to plan a trip to visit your cousin another time instead—but whichever option you choose, **your experience will be different in several ways than if you were making the decision based on a different core.** When you make a principle-centered choice:

- You make your decision confidently, knowing that it’s based in principle. You don’t feel pressured or guilty about anyone else’s reactions to your decision.
- You know that your decision is moving you closer to your long-term goals.
- You’ll feel at peace with your decision—no resentment or nagging guilt.

> **_Awaken the Giant Within_: Identify the Emotional Goals Behind Your Core Values**
> 
> While Covey asserts that your _core_ guides your actions, Tony Robbins argues that your _values_ serve this purpose. Although it appears that these two terms could be synonymous, Robbins [distinguishes between two types of values](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-12):
> 
> - _Ends_ are the emotional states you’re pursuing, and which make life fulfilling, like happiness and security.
>     
> - _Means_ are the ways you intend to reach the ends. For instance, valuing family is a means to experiencing love and happiness, which are ends. (Means seem to be more in line with Covey’s description of cores.)
>     
> 
> According to Robbins, you must **identify your _end_ values to avoid pursuing _means_ that lead to the wrong ends.** For example, imagine that you value freedom (end), so you pursue a management role at work (means) because you believe it will give you more freedom to set your schedule and priorities. However, when you get the promotion, you discover that you are more constrained because you now report to senior leadership and your performance directly impacts the company’s success. If you were focused only on the means, you would believe that you’ve achieved your goal, and you may not even realize that your lack of freedom is causing persistent dissatisfaction; on the other hand, if you’re aware of the ends you value, you can recognize that you need to change course to achieve them.
> 
> If you bristle at Covey’s suggestion to re-evaluate a core that’s important to you, such as family, you can use Robbins’s approach to reframe while still acknowledging all the things that give your life meaning. For example:
> 
> - Friend or Enemy—If your _core_ is your friends, perhaps your _end values_ are connection and a sense of belonging; if your _core_ is a work rival (a type of “enemy”), perhaps your _end value_ is becoming the best you can be in your profession, and your rival spurs you on.
>     
> - Work—If your _core_ is your work, perhaps your _end value_ is freedom: The more you work now, the faster you make money, and the faster you make (and save) money, the earlier you can retire and stop being chained to a job.
>     
> - Possessions—If your _core_ is a set of possessions like your wardrobe, perhaps your _end value_ is beauty.
>     
> - Church—If your _core_ is your church, perhaps your _end value_ is your connection to God.
>     
> - Self—If _you_ are your core, perhaps your _end value_ is caring for yourself so you can better care for others.
