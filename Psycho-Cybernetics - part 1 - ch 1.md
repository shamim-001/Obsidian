# Psycho-Cybernetics

[Back to My Library](https://www.shortform.com/app/library)

## Part 1: Principles of Psycho-Cybernetics | Chapter 1: What Is Psycho-Cybernetics?

_Psycho-Cybernetics_ explains how thinking of your mind as a machine can improve your self-image and dramatically increase your ability to feel successful and happy—**you can program your mind to achieve success and happiness** in the same way that you’d program a machine to achieve certain goals.

In this first part of the guide, we’ll cover the theory behind _Psycho-Cybernetics_. Then, in Part 2, we’ll discuss actionable ways to implement Maltz’s methods and improve your life.

In this chapter, we’ll explore why Maxwell Maltz, a plastic surgeon, began researching psychology and cybernetic theory to better understand why some people are prone to success, while others are prone to failure. We’ll then explain Maltz’s theory about how the human brain works to achieve goals according to cybernetic principles.

### Why a Plastic Surgeon Turned to Psychology

Throughout his time working as a plastic surgeon, Maltz realized that there was a discrepancy between how different patients responded to the correction of “physical flaws.” After surgery, some of his patients would display an immediate rise in self-esteem and self-confidence—he noticed that these patients were more comfortable with themselves and approached their goals more proactively than they did pre-surgery. This initially led Maltz to believe that transforming his patients’ physical appearance would lead them to think more positively about themselves—this rise in self-confidence would become apparent in their self-expression and personality, and it would have an impact on the level of success that they achieved.

However, this theory didn’t hold up, as he noticed that some patients showed no change in their personalities after surgery—they continued to think, feel, and act exactly as if the “flaw” was still there, and their inner feelings and attitudes remained the same. In other words, their outward appearance changed (sometimes drastically) but they still didn’t feel any happier or see themselves differently, and their level of success didn’t improve.

Through further research of this discrepancy, Maltz discovered that patients who responded positively to surgery (with a rise in self-esteem) _correctly_ identified their flaws as the cause of their low self-esteem. On the other hand, the patients who failed to change often had expectations that were not satisfied by the surgery—they _incorrectly_ identified their flaws as the cause of their low self-esteem and lack of success.

(Shortform note: Throughout the book, Maltz refers to “confidence” and “success” as interchangeable terms—he infers that the more confident you are, the more successful you are.)

> **Don’t Rely on Cosmetic Surgery to Improve Your Self-Esteem**
> 
> Psychological problems related to how people view their bodies are increasingly common. For example, a poll from the Mental Health Foundation revealed that [one in eight UK adults are so self-conscious about their body image that they have suicidal thoughts](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/13/body-image-survey-one-in-eight-uk-adults-suicidal-thoughts). The charity identified social media’s representation of the “idealized body image” as a cause of this distress.
> 
> Consequently, research shows that cosmetic surgery patients are more likely to suffer from “[Body Dysmorphic Disorder](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd),” an obsessive-compulsive disorder centered on _perceived physical flaws_. It’s therefore vital that medical practitioners watch out for patients who rely on cosmetic surgery as a source of their self-esteem, particularly those who view cosmetic surgery as a quick fix to confidence.
> 
> Further, [these patients are more likely to become addicted to cosmetic surgery](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/plastic-surgery-addiction/)—they have one procedure and feel an instant boost of confidence. Eventually, this confidence wears off and they find another “flaw” to fix, so they have another procedure, and so on.
> 
> While cosmetic surgery can help to promote a positive self-image, cosmetic surgeons do need to ensure that their patients are _emotionally healthy_ before agreeing to undertake any procedures. Emotional health in this respect means that patients have a balanced opinion about their appearance. They understand that most of what they experience has nothing to do
> 
> with how they look, and they realize that their lives won’t drastically change after cosmetic surgery.

#### Your Physical Appearance Doesn’t Define Your Self-Perception

After Maltz discovered that his patients responded differently to having their physical “flaws” corrected, he next realized that two people with the same physical flaw can **respond in dramatically different ways to the same feature.** One person may feel ashamed of this feature and use it as an excuse to withdraw from life, while the other person may not pay any attention to it and won’t let it affect her confidence (success).

- For example, two people have the same physical feature, such as a large nose. The first person pays no attention to her nose, doesn’t think of it as particularly large, and doesn’t let it impact the way she perceives herself—her nose doesn’t impact her approach to life. The second person is obsessed with the size of her nose, feels insecure all of the time, and believes that she’d be happier with a smaller nose—she blames her nose for her inability to approach life confidently.

Why is it that two people can respond so differently to the same flaw? If the first person is able to feel confident with her nose, why is the second person allowing this same feature to make her feel so unconfident? Would surgery help her to feel more confident and successful or is there something else making her feel insecure?

These questions led Maltz to pursue the connection between the mind and the body and its impact on levels of confidence and success. He paid particular attention to the process the human mind goes through to achieve goals, and drew on a wide range of research, including Psychologist Prescott Lecky’s **_Self-Consistency_ theory**.

(Shortform note: Lecky argued that you don’t simply act in response to the environment. Instead, your actions are motivated by the need to align your behaviors with your beliefs and ideas about yourself—in other words, **your behavior always reflects what you believe about yourself**.)

Eventually, Maltz concluded that **self-perception is far more important to success than physical appearance**: Your physical features don’t determine your approach to life and your levels of success and happiness—_only your thoughts about yourself_ impact how you behave and your quality of life. He realized that the key to self-improvement and more success was not simply to change external circumstances, but to **remove negative thought patterns that caused patients to view themselves as unsuccessful**.

According to Maltz, the second person from our earlier example has negative thought patterns that cause her to perceive herself as unsuccessful—she just happens to fixate on her nose as a focal point for her failures and unhappiness. So, a nose reduction may or may not help her to feel happier: What she _really_ needs to do is change her thought patterns and perceive herself in a more positive light.

> **Self-Compassion Leads to Self-Acceptance and Happiness**
> 
> Louise Hay, the founder of [Hay House](https://www.hayhouse.com/) and bestselling metaphysical author, was a firm believer in the mind-body connection—like Lecky and Maltz, she argued that our beliefs about ourselves impact our ability to succeed and experience happiness.
> 
> She took Maltz’s idea about how our thoughts influence our perception of our physical features a little further by claiming that our bodies are a physical representation, or a mirror, of our thoughts and beliefs: **_The more you love your body, the more beautiful it is_**. In her book, _[Love Your Body](https://www.hayhouse.com/love-your-body-paperback)_, she argues that _you should love your body regardless of your (perceived) flaws_. This act of compassion towards your body will release all negative thought patterns and the psychological illnesses (such as [body dysmorphia](https://glennmillermd.com/body-dysmorphic-disorder/)) that arise from them.
> 
> So for the example above, according to Hay, the person who hates her nose needs to love and accept her nose _before_ she can release her negative thought patterns about her nose. Once she loves her nose, her nose _will appear perfect_ to her. As a result, she’ll improve her self-esteem and self-confidence, and she’ll be able to approach life positively and achieve success.
> 
> **But can you make yourself love something that you believe is a flaw?** Hay insists that our physical features are not good or bad—our _judgments_ about our features simply label them as good or bad. This is why two people can perceive the same physical feature in opposite ways. The person who hates her nose has _made a habit of choosing to think negative thoughts_ about her nose. But once she understands that her nose isn’t the _real problem_, she can work to change her thoughts about her nose.
> 
> If this person was to follow Hay’s advice, she would look in the mirror multiple times a day, focus on her nose, and tell it that she loves and accepts it exactly as it is. This process would initially bring up emotional resistance (crying, anger, feelings of self-hate) because her mind will want to reject the new thought patterns (this links back to Lecky’s self-consistency theory—your mind won’t instantly accept new thought patterns that contradict your current self-perception). But, with daily practice, this mental resistance will soften, and her mind will eventually come to accept these positive thoughts and release the negative thoughts.

### Cybernetics: Your Mind Works Like a Machine to Reach Goals

Once Maltz concluded that the key to finding success and happiness is to change self-perception (to be more positive), he next needed to find out _why_ people perceive themselves in the way that they do. Only if we know how self-perception forms can we hope to influence it.

In an attempt to get to the root cause of _why people choose to perceive themselves the way that they do_, Maltz analyzed the process of success in reverse—he began to research the process the mind goes through to successfully achieve goals and how that links back to self-perception. Therefore, we’ll explain the mechanisms at play when you successfully achieve a goal.

(Shortform note: **Maltz chose to analyze goals in reverse** because of the way he views success: He doesn’t see it as external manifestations of prestige such as an impressive career, big house, or expensive car. Instead, he refers to _success as an internal feeling_, specifically, **the satisfaction you feel when you achieve a goal that’s meaningful to you**. Because he believed that your levels of confidence impact your ability to succeed in achieving goals, and your self-perception impacts your confidence, he believed he could figure out the solution to success by analyzing how successful goals are achieved.)

Maltz’s research into the process the mind goes through to achieve goals led him to the work of Dr. John von Neumann, who explored the parallels between computers and the human mind. Neumann’s concepts led Maltz to develop an interest in cybernetic theory—a branch of science that studies the goal-oriented behavior of mechanical systems.

- **Cybernetic theory** explores how self-guided machines incorporate feedback to self-correct and stay on target. Machines have an objective and an in-built guidance system to ensure that they successfully achieve their goal.

The more Maltz analyzed the way humans achieve goals, the more he realized that the human brain and nervous system operate in accordance with cybernetic principles. We direct our minds (often unconsciously) to achieve results in the same way that we program machines to achieve specific objectives.

To clarify how you achieve results in the same way that a cybernetic machine does, we’ll illustrate the two distinct ways that machines operate and rely upon feedback to either reach their targets, or to find solutions, and compare it to how your mind functions to achieve similar goals:

#### 1) When the Objective Is to Reach a Target

When the target is clearly defined, both machines and humans rely upon an inbuilt guidance system that allows them to interpret positive and negative feedback to help them reach the intended target.

**For a machine, imagine a missile programmed to hit a clear target**: In this case, the missile has sensors in place which provide feedback to guide it to its target. This feedback is positive (missile is on the correct path) and negative (missile isn’t on the correct path). The missile continues to move forward and uses this feedback to correct its course and eventually reach the target.

**For the human mind, imagine how you learned to eat**: The act of directing a spoon into your mouth took a lot of practice and there were many times that you ended up with food on your forehead or in your lap. Throughout all of this, your brain was trying to reach a target (get food into your mouth) and relied on positive and negative feedback to know if it was on the right track. Once you successfully managed to get the food into your mouth, your brain recorded the process as a success and began to duplicate the process every time you fed yourself.

(Shortform note: Maltz focused primarily on how the human brain successfully reaches a target or achieves a goal. However, his theory does bring up questions about how learning disabilities can impact this process. According to the latest research, [learning disabilities are due to permanent neurological disorders](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4865-learning-disabilities-what-you-need-to-know) that limit the **brain’s ability to store and process information** and impact 15% of the school-age population. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce these limitations: According to recent research, [multisensory teaching techniques limit the effects of some learning disabilities](https://dyslexiaida.org/multisensory-structured-language-teaching-fact-sheet/) by activating other areas of the brain to improve the way students store and process information.)

#### 2) When the Objective Is to Find a Solution

When a problem needs to be solved, both machines and humans rely upon stored memory to process data, to record feedback, and to arrive at an appropriate solution.

**For a machine, imagine how a calculator works to solve mathematical equations**: You input a problem (the equation you want solved) and the calculator uses the data you input, as well as its own stored memory of processes, to figure out and discover the solution to the problem.

**For the human mind, imagine how you learned to figure out simple equations**: Before you could achieve this, you had to learn how to count and your brain had to record this data. Your brain then used this data (the numbers you memorized) to figure out how different combinations of these numbers produced different results. Every time you made a mistake, your brain would remember this error and try to avoid making it again. Every time you managed to correctly solve an equation, your brain would record the success. Eventually, your brain discovered the correct process to quickly solve similar equations.

> **How Your Brain Learns New Things**
> 
> Since _Psycho-Cybernetics_’s publication in 1960, neuroscientists have developed the ability to observe how learning occurs at the molecular level—they can see [what goes on inside our brains when we’re engaged in learning something new](https://ccsuconed.wordpress.com/2017/07/25/what-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-learn-a-new-skill/).
> 
> The more you learn, the more you change the physical structure of your brain by strengthening specific neural pathways. Here’s a very brief overview of neural pathways:
> 
> - The brain consists of a dense network of pathways consisting of neurons.
>     
> - Synapses allow sensory information to be transmitted through this network of neurons.
>     
> - This sensory information is stored in your short-term memory while your brain processes it by comparing it to the memories you’ve stored in your long-term memory. This process determines whether the new sensory information is kept or discarded.
>     
> 
> Neuroscientists believe that your memory and recall rely upon the relationship that your neurons have with each other. The stronger the relationship (the more frequently these neurons interact with each other), the stronger your ability to remember and recall what you need to do. This is because strong neural pathways heighten the transmission speed of information and allow you to effortlessly recall the information you need. This is why you can perform your routine tasks without conscious effort.
> 
> Every time you learn something new, you need to form new neural connections within the brain—this requires conscious effort and attention. When you attempt to do something new, your brain has to work much harder because you haven’t yet developed the specific neural pathways—the neurons required to achieve the task haven’t developed a relationship so their communication is inefficient. However, the more you practice, the more you strengthen your neural pathways and encourage the required neurons to interact and develop strong pathways.
> 
> While cybernetic machines operate in the same way—they store the correct information and processes in their hard drive and can only operate as efficiently as their memory allows (RAM determines the speed and efficiency of a computer), they benefit from not having to _learn or make decisions_. Programming (coding for example) determines how they operate, and their hardware and software components determine what kind of tasks they can complete (a Dyson can’t solve equations because it doesn’t have the hardware or software built into it).

In both of the above examples, your brain worked according to cybernetic principles to reach your target or find a solution. It used positive and negative feedback to check if it was on track and, once it figured out the correct method, **your brain recorded the successful feedback and discarded the negative feedback** (which no longer served any purpose once your brain memorized the correct process) so that you could continue to repeat the action without further conscious thought. So now, you can eat and solve simple equations without having to think about it.

> **How Cybernetic Theory Has Evolved Since _Psycho-Cybernetics_’ Publication**
> 
> To develop his theory, Maltz drew on the work of [Dr. Norbert Wiener](https://norbertwiener.org/)—the originator of cybernetic theory, and the first scientist to theorize that all intelligent behavior is the result of feedback mechanisms—and Dr. John von Neumann, who explored the analogies between technology and the human brain in his seminal work, _[Computer and the Brain](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300181111/computer-and-brain)_.
> 
> Both scientists made important contributions to the development of modern artificial intelligence. However, recent developments in artificial intelligence have subverted the original theory that machines need humans to create and operate them in order to function and fulfill their objectives.
> 
> For example, some scientists have explored the possibility of merging animal or human brain cells (neurons) with technology to create [machines with biological brains](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-and-cybernetics/). This takes the concept of humans controlling machines to a whole new level—humans creating machines with the ability to govern themselves—and throws up a number of social and ethical issues that need to be considered.
> 
> In addition, it’s already possible for a [human brain to interface with a computer](https://interestingengineering.com/top-9-cybernetic-upgrades-everyone-will-want)—_brains and computers can communicate with each other_ through the use of electromagnetic signals. Apparently, this process can help to overcome mental disorders and improve brain cognition. This has massive implications, especially in the area of healthcare—for example, if someone suffers from a brain injury and has to relearn how to eat, they could interface with a computer to help speed up the process.
