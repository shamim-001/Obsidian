## Chapter 7: Four Action Levels

There’s no formula for calculating how much action it will take to reach a specific goal. But in general, the more effort you put in, the better your chances of success. Your actions must be both consistent and persistent.

**Applying enough effort is more important than having the right idea or business plan. Most people fail because they don’t do enough (take sufficient action) to succeed**. Everyone opts for one of these four action levels, but only the fourth brings success:

1) Not doing anything

2) Retreating

3) Taking an average amount of action

4) Taking extreme action

We’ve all acted at each of these levels, depending on the situation. You might put extreme effort into your career, but back away from acting in another situation, such as a relationship or exercising for your health.

Typically, people do nothing, retreat, or put in an average amount of action. Doing nothing and retreating result in failure. Taking average action produces no better than average results. Only extreme action guarantees success. Following is a closer look at the levels:

### 1) Not Doing Anything

You may choose not to do anything to advance your career, improve your finances or build your relationships. People who choose passivity have given up on their dreams and decided to take life as it comes. They’re bored, lethargic, and lack motivation or a sense of purpose.

While doing nothing may sound like a way to avoid stress or disappointment, **it requires a surprising amount of effort.** In fact, each of the four action levels requires effort. People who decide to do nothing devote time and energy justifying it to themselves and others.

Interestingly, people who choose to do nothing in some areas of their lives often devote extreme action to another, usually a hobby such as gaming or biking, or a time-waster.

### 2) Retreating

People who retreat or backpedal often do so because they fear action will have negative consequences. They may actually have experienced problems like rejection or failure in the past and want to prevent them from recurring, or they just fear them.

The normal human impulse is to push forward or advance into new territory; children display this until being told repeatedly: be careful, don’t touch, or don’t do something that looks interesting. Young adults may be advised to not be too ambitious. Adults who retreat from action make many excuses: the stock market is terrible, so I'm not investing; most relationships fail, so I’m not pursuing one; all politicians are self-serving, so there’s no reason to vote.

All of these instances require a decision against acting and the energy to justify it. However, if you’re expending effort in the first place, why not devote it to success?

### 3) Taking Average Action

**Most people put in an average amount of effort, the amount that seems necessary or enough to get by**.

This is the middle-class approach, where people do enough to reach a certain level of comfort, and to create “normal” lives, careers, and marriages. An average level of action is the biggest hindrance to success because it seems most acceptable but produces only average results. Most employees, managers, and even executives fit in with the crowd rather than stand out. **However, average performers are doomed when adversity strikes and acceptable action isn’t enough**—for example, when people are laid off and can’t compete with high performers for a new job.

No one would buy a product advertised as average, so why accept being an average student, having an average marriage or average body type, and making an average salary? If you’re average, but you’re capable of doing more, you’re really retreating or choosing inaction. Living up to your potential and achieving extraordinary results requires level-4 action.

Chapter 8 examines in detail the consequences of striving for middle-class averageness.

### 4) Taking Extreme Action

Constant action is the normal state for people and nature. Children are always acting unless something’s wrong or adults are telling them to calm down. In nature, there’s always action, whether under the earth’s crust, in the ocean, or in a colony of insects.

Applying extreme action is the only way to get extreme success. However, in the shorter run, be aware that approaching any task with extreme action creates problems—for instance, more work or more clients to service—but it leads to more success. **If you’re not creating problems, it’s a sign you’re not putting in enough effort.**

#### What Extreme Action Looks Like

**1) When you’re going all out, you don’t count the hours you work or expect to have a routine.**

For example, when Cardone first launched his seminar business, he worked from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. He made cold calls, sometimes visiting 40 companies a day to promote his training programs and presentations. He didn’t sign up every company he visited, but he generated more new business than he would have by taking less action and contacting fewer potential clients. His mindset of approaching each day as if his future depended on his actions became a habit—and he got big results. In fact, extreme action generates bigger results than anything you learn at a training program.

**2) You may be called obsessive, a workaholic, or never satisfied** by people taking average levels of action or doing only what others think is necessary. When you succeed in a big way, expect to be labeled by others because they feel inadequate by comparison or feel threatened.

But no one who is more successful than you are will denigrate your extreme effort, because they know what it takes to excel.

**3) Taking extreme action means taking steps that seem unreasonable or over the top to others—then following up these steps with even more action.** You’ll know you’re on the right track when you create new problems and receive criticism and warnings from others to slow down. Even your manager may discourage you from putting in so much effort. But stay the course—extreme action breaks the spell of mediocrity that paralyzes others, and you’ll stand out in terms of both effort and results.

**4) Extreme action means seizing every opportunity that comes your way.** Extreme action will always help you, especially if you and your product or service aren’t widely known. For example, Cardone urged his wife, an actress, to accept every invitation to audition, whether or not she felt the part was right for her. The important thing was to be noticed; if one role didn’t pan out, she might be offered a different one later.

When you take extreme action to get attention, results such as greater business success will follow. Attention leads to money and power. No one else will step up to make your dreams come true or to promote your company to the rest of the world. You must take extreme action to become so well known that when people think of the service you provide—in Cardone’s case, business training programs—they think of you.
