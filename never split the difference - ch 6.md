## Chapter 6: Change Their Perspective

Thus far, Voss has explained how people’s behavior and thoughts in negotiations are primarily driven by their emotional needs for security and autonomy. If you can help them meet those emotional needs using techniques like calculated empathy, summarizing, and open-ended questions, you are in a prime position to get them to divulge their hidden wants and desires—crucial information that will give you the upper hand in a negotiation.

In this chapter, Voss explores the tactics that enable you to properly identify, articulate, and use those hidden desires and irrational blind spots to your advantage. You do this by switching up their perspective—showing them that by helping you achieve _your_ desired solution, they will satisfy their _own_ hidden wants.Specifically, he looks at:

- How to use time to your advantage by refusing to be boxed in by deadlines
- How to exploit their notions of fairness and unfairness
- How to use your counterpart’s cognitive biases like framing effects and loss aversion to your advantage

### Make Deadlines Work

Voss observes that deadlines are one of the most common sources of anxiety in negotiations. **We feel that we will lose out on an opportunity if we don’t make a deal right away**, or that these terms will never be available again (this feeling of anxiety is related to a cognitive bias known as loss aversion, which Voss explores a bit later in the chapter).

Voss warns that your counterpart will often try to exploit your anxiety by using deadlines to put pressure on you to make a deal. This is one of the cornerstones of high-pressure sales tactics, in which a salesperson tells you that a deal is for “the holiday season only” or that a product is “only available on a first-come, first-serve basis.” These deadlines compel you to suspend your rational judgement, ignore the pros and cons, brush aside questions of whether or not you even _need_ the item in question, and, ultimately, rush headlong into a bad decision.

(Shortform note: In _[High Performance Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-performance-habits)_, Brendon Burchard argues top performers hold themselves to hard deadlines because it creates a sense of urgency that helps them prioritize. They don’t get distracted by soft deadlines (i.e., deadlines that don’t have serious ramifications if they’re not met) and instead focus their energy on completing highly consequential, time-sensitive tasks. Also, because these deadlines are usually set by other people (like bosses or clients), high performers recognize that their timeliness affects other people’s ability to do _their_ jobs. Burchard writes that this further encourages urgency and service. This is one way you can make deadlines work for you on a personal level, helping you to essentially negotiate with yourself on progress toward a goal.)

#### Using Deadlines to Your Advantage

Voss argues that **deadlines are almost always arbitrary and flexible, and rarely trigger the dreaded consequences people fear they will.** Instead, their real purpose is to force people to compromise with themselves in order to meet them, because people tend to feel pressured to take any deal _now_ rather than holding out for a better deal if they fear they might lose the deal entirely.

According to Voss, a lot of old-school negotiation theories advise that you don’t reveal the deadline that you’re working under, arguing that if you do, the other side will assume you’re under a time crunch and will try to pressure you into making a deal on _their_ terms. These theories say your counterpart will attempt to run out the clock and delay discussion of the issues until the very end. For example, if you only have until Friday to make a deal and you let the other side know this, they’ll wait until Thursday to start negotiating in earnest thinking that you’ll then cave to their demands.

But Voss argues that **you _should_ reveal your deadline to your counterpart.** Doing so puts time pressure on _them_ as well as you, as **_they_ lose out from a missed deal just as much as you.** This forces the other side to get down to negotiating immediately and reduces the risk of a no-deal impasse.

(Shortform note: Voss is not the only prominent figure who takes a critical view of the idea of deadlines. Anthony Casalena, founder and CEO of Squarespace, has said that [he likewise finds deadlines to be arbitrary and meaningless](https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/squarespace-deadlines-arbitrary.html). Casalena finds that rushing to meet deadlines tends to compromise the quality of work and burn people out unnecessarily. His philosophy is simply to change a deadline if he feels that his team won’t be able to put out the best possible product by that date.)

As a good negotiator, Voss writes that you also need to use _their_ deadline to your advantage. He cites the example of car dealers making generous offers when their reviews are up at the end of the month. Because they have to meet sales quotas as part of those performance reviews, they have a powerful incentive to close the deal on your terms.

> **Trade Deadlines in Sports**
> 
> As Voss notes, a skilled negotiator will look for ways to use deadlines to their advantage. One area in the real world where we can sometimes see truly exceptional use of deadlines is in professional sports. In _[Moneyball](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/moneyball)_, author Michael Lewis describes how Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane skillfully exploited Major League Baseball’s trade deadline in 2002 to acquire excellent players from other teams while giving up little in return.
> 
> The annual trade deadline is the point in the season after which players cannot be traded. What this means is that weak teams that are no longer in playoff contention are looking to offload their stars. This is especially true if those players are set to become free agents in the offseason—after which they can sign with any other team they wish, leaving their original team with nothing to compensate for the loss. Thus, the trade deadline creates a time crunch in which losing teams with star players are desperate to “sell” their stars in the hopes of recouping at least _something_ of value.
> 
> As Beane wisely recognized, the deadline served to create a glut in the market for star players, which lowered their price and gave him the opportunity to acquire players that he could never afford at the beginning of the season.

### Reject Unfairness

Voss further argues that most people are powerfully guided by their notions of what is and isn’t fair—they are drawn to what they consider to be fair, equitable, and reasonable and repelled by what they consider to be unfair or unreasonable. He writes that you can take advantage of this fact and change someone’s perspective by demonstrating that you care about treating them well. This triggers their natural empathy and forces them to see you as an honest broker in the negotiation. This is especially true since **people’s quest for fairness and their desire to reject _unfairness_ can lead them to irrational choices**, according to Voss. Knowing this can be a powerful advantage for you in negotiating.

Of course, to truly put this into action, Voss says you need to have a good definition of “fairness.” He identifies three uses of the term—two of them being underhanded tricks and one that sets the stage for open negotiation.

- The first usage is meant solely to destabilize the other side. When you hear things like, “I just want you to treat me fairly” that’s what they’re doing. The goal is to trigger defensiveness and a willingness to concede, because no one wants to be perceived as being unfair or unreasonable.
- The second is when we accuse the other side of being either too dense or dishonest to recognize a fair offer. When someone says, “What we’re proposing is quite fair,” this is what they’re doing. It’s meant to manipulate you into accepting their terms by playing on your innate desire to be fair and reasonable. Voss recommends responding to this manipulative use of “fair” by reflecting back and turning it back on them with something like, “You say your offer is fair. It seems like you’ve got some pretty good evidence to back that up. Are you prepared to show me?” This will force them to divulge more information to you, which will give you deeper insight into their true negotiating position.
- The third one sets the stage for empathy and honesty: **“It’s important to me that you _feel_ I’m treating you fairly. I mean that and I genuinely want you to stop and tell me if you feel I’m not living up to that.”**

> **Fairness and Cultural Variation**
> 
> Voss writes that you never want to put your counterpart in a position where she feels she’s being treated unfairly. But depending on what culture she’s from, you might also want to make sure she doesn’t feel that _you or others_ are being treated unfairly either.
> 
> Beyond Voss’s three definitions of the word “fair,” some researchers have found that attitudes about fairness or equity differ significantly across cultures. For example, one study demonstrated that [children’s sense of injustice when they receive more than others varies significantly between children from different countries.](https://www.livescience.com/52841-sense-of-fairness-varies-across-culture.html)
> 
> Researchers brought together over 800 children from the U.S., Canada, India, Mexico, Peru, Senegal, and Uganda. The study tested the children’s ideas of fairness by measuring how pairs of children reacted to different distributions of candy between the two participants. One child would pull a lever to dispense the candy. In half the experiments, the candy was split 50/50. But the other half of the time, the candy was distributed unevenly between the child pulling the lever (the “lever puller”) and their partner. The lever puller had the option of either accepting or rejecting the allocation of candy—with the latter choice meaning that neither child would receive anything.
> 
> While nearly all lever-pullers across all countries of origin rejected candy splits in which _they_ were shortchanged (disadvantageous inequality), only lever pullers from the U.S., Canada, and Ugandan children proved willing to reject distributions in which their _counterpart_ received less (advantageous inequality).

### Understand Cognitive Biases

Voss writes that you need to figure out what your counterpart’s true, underlying need is and then _frame your_ _position_ such that it satisfies that need. To do so, you can take advantage of their cognitive biases: mental errors in routine information processing that impact how we react to situations and form judgments. And, in fact, **powerful cognitive biases shape how we receive information and determine our best interests.**

Voss notes that advertisers understand this principle well. The products and services we purchase are usually presented to us as satisfying some deeper, more intrinsic need. When someone purchases a home-security system, they’re not _really_ purchasing the sensor, door chimes, cameras, or home-automation technology. Instead, what they’re really buying is the peace of mind that comes with believing that their home and family are safe. That’s why advertisements for these products emphasize the emotional benefits of being able to enjoy normal life without having to think about your family being harmed or your possessions being stolen.

Similarly, Voss notes that makers of luxury products like sports cars and jewelry don’t emphasize the technical features of the vehicle or the gemological specifics of the diamond ring they’re trying to sell. Instead, they highlight the exclusivity and rarity of these goods. They do this because they know that their customers are largely driven by the need to assert their _status_ through owning and displaying these products, which satisfies a deeper need to feel superior to others.

(Shortform note: Economists call status symbol goods like jewelry, fine champagnes, or designer jewelry _Veblen goods_—named for the economist Thorstein Veblen, who famously explored the phenomenon of conspicuous consumption among economic elites in 1899’s _[The Theory of the Leisure Class](https://www.routledge.com/The-Theory-of-the-Leisure-Class/Veblen/p/book/9781560005629)_. Veblen goods differ from ordinary goods in that [demand for them tends to increase as their price increases](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp#:~:text=Veblen%20goods%20are%20typically%20high,%2C%20yachts%2C%20and%20luxury%20cars.). As they become more expensive, fewer people can afford to buy them, which makes them rare. For people who wish to own such rare items to highlight their elite status, this rarity and exclusivity is precisely what makes them valuable.)

The same principle applies to your negotiating position, argues Voss. How you _frame_ your position or offer matters just as much—if not _more_ than—the actual substance of the position itself. And as a skilled negotiator, you can take advantage of universal human cognitive biases to frame your position in a way that makes it optimally attractive to your counterpart.

#### Cognitive Bias #1: The Framing Effect

The first cognitive bias Voss points to is what’s known as the framing effect. **People respond differently to identical choices based solely on how they’re presented.** For example, the framing effect would make health-conscious consumers more likely to purchase milk when it’s marketed as being “99% fat-free” versus “1% fat”, believing that the first option is less fatty (even though, of course, there’s no difference between either product other than how the label positions them).

(Shortform note: A variant on the framing effect is what’s known as the valence-framing effect. Research has shown that people hold their negative opinions—in other words, what they’re _against_—much more strongly and confidently than their positive opinions—what they’re in _favor_ of. In other words, [we seem to dislike what we dislike more than we like what we like](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/difference-opinion/202002/how-do-framing-effects-impact-your-political-behavior). In one social psychology experiment, participants who expressed a preference for fictional political candidate A over candidate B showed a notable division in how they responded to information that their preferred candidate had engaged in corruption. Those who supported candidate A because they were _pro_-candidate A were more willing to abandon their support in light of this information; those who favored A because they were _anti_-candidate B were far more likely to dismiss the corruption allegations and even double down on their support for A.)

#### Cognitive Bias #2: Loss Aversion

Closely related to the framing effect is the principle of loss aversion. **Loss aversion makes people fear an equal loss more than they value an equal gain**. Voss observes that salespeople are skillful manipulators of the loss aversion principle. When they say things like, “I just wanted to give you the opportunity to take advantage of this offer before it goes away, ” they’re creating a (usually false) feeling of urgency that triggers your sense of loss aversion. When something is framed this way, **you’re no longer thinking of gaining something—you’re thinking about _losing_ out on a potential deal.**

Knowing this, you can put yourself in a strong negotiating position by **framing your preferred solution as one that _prevents your counterpart from incurring a loss_**.

For example, if you’re making an offer on a house that needs some work, you might say something like, “The house is great but it definitely needs significant contracting work. There’s foundational damage, and the gas line for the grill is too close to the house to pass inspection. I’m willing to pay cash now and absorb those costs **so _you_ don’t have to shell out that money**. Plus, I’m willing to waive inspection. But if we take too long and end up having to go through inspection, **I might have to start looking for other deals.”**

> **Loss Aversion and the “Scarcity Principle”**
> 
> In _[Influence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence)_, author Robert Cialdini argues that loss aversion is closely tied to an idea called the Scarcity Principle. The Scarcity Principle makes things with limited availability more appealing to us. Thus, rare goods are expensive and abundant items are cheap (like how gold is more valuable than iron). We’re more compelled to buy these goods because we instinctively fear that we’ll lose our opportunity if we don’t act immediately.
> 
> Cialdini notes that sales professionals are skilled in using this principle to their advantage. It’s why we see so many “limited-time only” or “first-come, first-serve” sales pitches: The goal is to drive you the buyer into a loss-aversion frenzy that forces you to suspend your better judgement and rush headlong into an ill-considered decision. Knowing this, you can use the principle to your advantage by making your counterpart feel your offer has an element of scarcity built in.

#### How to Frame What You Want

With this new knowledge of cognitive biases, Voss presents specific negotiating tactics to make your counterpart think about your position in the way you want them to.

**Anchor their emotions by anticipating their accusations** so that you acknowledge all of their fears. By preparing them for a loss, you’ll trigger their loss aversion and make them work hard just to avoid it. This also helps frame your offer as being _better_ than worse alternatives. Even something as seemingly innocuous as prefacing a criticism with “You might hate me for saying this, but…” can achieve this. You’re priming them for an unpleasant experience. And in order to _avoid_ that experience, they’ll start convincing themselves that what you’re telling them isn’t actually that bad—in other words, they’re already doing the mental work to avoid a “loss.”

- (Shortform note: For similar reasons, [negotiators who frame their offer from the start as a way to avoid a negative outcome are more likely to succeed](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/negotiation-techniques-framing-38785.html) than those who frame their offer as a way to achieve a positive outcome.)

**Let your counterpart make the first move**. Remember, you don’t know enough about what you’re buying or selling to make an informed offer right away, so use _their_ offer as a starting point. But also be aware that your counterpart might try to use this to their advantage by throwing out an extreme first offer to use framing effects against _you._ For example, a car dealer might ask a ludicrous price for a non-luxury vehicle, like $80,000. When you balk at this and they bring it down to a still-quite-high $50,000, the latter figure feels more reasonable by comparison, tricking you into thinking it’s a good deal.

- (Shortform note: In _[Influence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence)_, Robert Cialdini calls this last trick the “Rejection-Then-Retreat” tactic. Your counterpart makes an extreme first ask, which you reject, and then they counter with a more “reasonable” second offer. They’ve now primed your brain by using what’s called the _contrast effect_ (when an unreasonable first offer makes the second offer seem more reasonable). They’ve also taken advantage of your natural empathy and desire to treat others with reciprocity—by scaling back their initial request, they’ve tricked you into thinking that they’ve offered you a concession. And they’re counting on you reciprocating their “concession” with one of your own, by saying “yes” to their second request.)

**If you’re negotiating something with a monetary value, establish a range**. Base it on historical examples or what the figures in comparable deals look like. Voss also advises you to properly anchor your range (where one of the “extreme” ends of the range is actually the number you want). For example, if you’re looking to buy a new home, you could say to the seller, “Houses in this market with this many bedrooms and bathrooms typically go for between $150,000 and $180,000,” when $180,000 is really the realistic figure you’d like to pay. By framing it this way, you’re making it seem to the seller like they’re extracting maximum value from you when you’re actually just paying the price you wanted.

**Be open to, and consider offering, non-monetary terms like recognition and perks**. These are often small add-ins that cost nothing but can make all the difference to you or your counterpart. For example, universities are often able to secure larger philanthropic gifts from alumni donors by offering to put the donor’s name on a building or classroom on campus. This costs the university next to nothing in the way of money (they have to put _some_ signage on the building or classroom anyway), but the non-monetary prestige of these naming opportunities often makes a huge difference to the benefactor.

**Use strange numbers**. Voss writes that unusual numbers _sound_ like a product of precise calculation, even if they’re completely arbitrary. Your counterpart is far more likely to take a number like $41,972.37 seriously than $40,000 (which sounds like a placeholder or just a negotiating platform).

- (Shortform note: This is backed up by empirical research. In a study, people making an opening offer with a precise dollar amount like $19,217.32 were found by their counterparts [to have superior knowledge about what was being negotiated](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/newsroom/newsn/2375/new-research-shows-that-asking-for-a-precise8212not-round8212number-during-negotiations-can-give-you-the-upper-hand) compared to people who made round-dollar offers like $19,000. And because of this, the counterparts were willing to make bigger concessions to those making precise offers.)

**Surprise your counterpart with a gift**. Voss says this can even be a simple conciliatory gesture that costs you little, like an offer to pick up lunch or coffee. This engenders goodwill and triggers their natural emotional need for empathy and reciprocity. People feel the need to repay kindness with kindness.

> **Frame for Success in Negotiation**
> 
> Harvard’s Program on Negotiation offers more techniques to [frame your offer to be maximally appealing](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/business-negotiations/framing-in-negotiation/) (these tactics complement Voss’s):
> 
> - While you want to offer a range and throw in non-monetary items and gifts, don’t overwhelm them with _too_ many options. Sometimes people can become so bewildered and dismayed by an abundance of choices that making _no_ decision feels like the better option.
>     
> - Make three offers simultaneously with different parameters, such as $50,000 for a standard package, $60,000 for a standard package on an accelerated timeline, or $75,000 for a premium package. This lets you and your counterpart figure out what’s most important to both of you and gives a choice, similar to Voss’s suggestion of establishing a range of values. When you signal a range of what you’re willing to pay, it can open a conversation about what makes you pay the low end of the range vs. the high end.
>     
> - Present an expensive option that’s meant to be rejected, but that makes your standard option look cheap. In the example above, the $75,000 package might not be something people choose often, but it makes the $50,000 package look cheap in comparison and thus makes them feel they’re getting a bargain.
