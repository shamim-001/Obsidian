## Part 1: Musk’s Early Life and Career

In _Elon Musk_, journalist Ashlee Vance explores the life and career of Elon Musk, who he believes is one of the most influential innovators of his generation. He describes an entrepreneur who is driven by big goals and personal interests, not trends or get-rich-quick schemes. Despite facing challenges and public doubt, Musk changed three major industries and became a billionaire in the process.

Vance is a writer and journalist who covers topics in technology. After spending almost 50 hours interviewing Musk, Vance presents unique insight into his life. His biography will interest anyone who wants to learn about Musk, his entrepreneurial mindsets, or industries with the potential to change the future.

In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll describe Musk’s early life and companies. In the following three sections, we’ll discuss SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity. In Part 5, we’ll explore Musk’s traits that helped him succeed, including a high risk tolerance and a desire to learn. Finally, in Part 6, we’ll discuss Musk’s management style. In our commentary, we’ll compare Musk and his methods to other successful innovators and entrepreneurs and provide updated context on the success of his companies.

### Childhood

Elon Musk was born in South Africa in 1971. Vance describes how Musk felt like an outsider growing up since he was a quiet, nerdy child. He spent most of his time reading, even consuming encyclopedias after he’d read all of the books at local libraries. Because of his photographic memory, he remembered specific facts and could accurately recite them. Using this knowledge, he often corrected people, thus gaining a reputation as a know-it-all.

> **Trevor Noah and Growing Up in Apartheid in South Africa**
> 
> Vance mentions that while Musk “enjoyed a level of privilege,” he felt like an outsider growing up because his nerdy interests and reserved personality differed from the hypermasculine values of South African culture. But Vance doesn’t expand on one aspect of Musk’s childhood that would have given him an automatic privilege in his particular circumstances—the racial tensions that existed in South Africa at the time and “the level of privilege” Musk had as a white person growing up during apartheid.
> 
> [Apartheid](https://shortform.com/app/book/born-a-crime/part-1-chapter-1#a-little-history)—meaning separateness or aparthood—was a system of institutionalized racial segregation in South Africa, with the white minority dominating the social, political, and financial spheres. Blacks were to have no rights and be constantly monitored and controlled. At its core, apartheid was like a combination of the Indian massacres, slavery, and Jim Crow in America.
> 
> Like Musk, comedian Trevor Noah grew up in South Africa, but as a mixed-race person—which was illegal—he experienced a much different, more hateful side of South Africa than Musk did. In _[Born a Crime](https://shortform.com/app/book/born-a-crime)_, Noah explains how [he spent most of his childhood indoors to hide his complexion](https://shortform.com/app/book/born-a-crime/chapter-2#noahs-sheltered-life) and how he didn’t have friends because he couldn’t legally play with them, not because they had different interests from his. He also personally saw the violence of apartheid, such as when his mother threw him off of a moving bus since the bus driver wouldn’t stop for them or when his step-father shot his mother twice. Noah’s account provides more context on what life in South Africa looked like and how Musk’s privilege gave him advantages when navigating society.

#### Parental Troubles

When Musk was eight years old, his parents divorced, and his mother Maye moved the three children to the Musk’s holiday home on the east coast of South Africa. After a few years, Musk decided to live with his father, Errol. Vance notes that Musk wouldn’t go into great detail about his father, but he acknowledged that Errol was a difficult person to be around, inflicted a level of psychological torture on him, made his life miserable, and dismissed Musk’s dream of moving to America.

(Shortform note: While Musk doesn’t explain the specifics of what made Errol a difficult father, Maye provided more insight in her memoir _[A Woman Makes a Plan](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/607734/a-woman-makes-a-plan-by-maye-musk/)_. She explains that [Errol was manipulative and abusive—physically, financially, and emotionally](https://www.insidehook.com/article/tech/elon-musk-childhood-revealed-maye-musk-memoir). In another interview, Musk supported her claim, stating Errol was physically violent with him when Musk was very young.)

#### Social Problems

Musk’s bookishness and know-it-all reputation set him apart from his peers, and he was beaten and bullied by a group of boys for several years. Musk noted that this was one of the most difficult experiences of his childhood. The bullying finally stopped when he switched to a different high school with a more peaceful environment.

(Shortform note: Musk is one of [many successful people who were the victims of childhood bullying](https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-were-bullied-2017-12#kate-middleton-2). For example, Steve Jobs, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, singer Rihanna, and Duchess Kate Middleton are just a few notable people who were bullied as children. The reasons for the bullying varied—race, disposition, personal interests, appearance, intelligence, or physical size—but all stem from being viewed as different. Often the traits they were bullied for are now part of their success, indicating resilience and embracing these different features are key to success and overcoming the long-term negative effects of bullying.)

#### Developing Lifelong Interests

But his childhood also had its perks—Musk had the freedom and resources to explore what interested him:

- **Technology**: Errol bought Musk a computer, feeding his fascination with technology and leading to an interest in coding and software. He also became interested in Silicon Valley, which was a hub of technological advancement at the time.
- **Renewable energy**: Vance explains that Musk’s interest in clean energy also started at a young age. In high school, Musk drew attention for his strong views on solar power as a replacement for fossil fuels.
- **Space**: His love of sci-fi novels encouraged an interest in rockets and space exploration.

Vance notes that Musk’s interests are lifelong ones, as we’ll see reflected in each of his companies.

(Shortform note: While Musk found his interest in technology, renewable energy, and space early on in life, Angela Duckworth notes that this isn’t always the case for people—in fact, she thinks many people have unrealistic expectations of how interests are discovered. In _[Grit](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit)_, she contends that [most people don’t find their interests early—they discover and develop them over time](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit/part-2-1#interests-develop-over-time). So don’t expect to discover your interest early in life or right out of college. You need to nurture that interest through time, persistence, and practice by frequently engaging with it. This kind of passion can last a lifetime.)

### Leaving South Africa

After graduating high school, Musk left South Africa for Canada because he wanted to avoid mandatory military service, since that would have required him to contribute to the apartheid regime. He also thought Canada would help him get to America as quickly as possible, which was his ultimate goal. Vance explains that he spent a few years in Canada and attended college. While there, he met and dated another student named Justine, who would eventually become his first wife. Midway through his degree, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, thus completing his goal of moving to America.

(Shortform note: While Musk went to college, he believes it isn’t necessary for success, citing Bill Gates and Steve Jobs as examples of people who accomplished great things without a college degree—although he doesn’t account for the fact that both Gates and Jobs attended university without finishing their degrees. Musk has said that [college is “basically for fun”](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-college-not-for-learning-not-required-at-tesla-2020-3) and [doesn’t require employees at his companies to have a college degree](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-no-college-degree-needed-to-work-at-tesla-2019-12).)

### Zip2

In 1995, after graduating college, Musk moved to Silicon Valley with his brother Kimbal to try to start a dot-com company. They founded Zip2, a searchable online directory that linked to a map. Vance explains that Musk thought of the idea during one of his internships after a salesman gave a weak pitch for an online Yellow Pages. But Musk saw a business opportunity: selling a way for companies to advertise online.

The brothers rented a small office for Zip2. Despite some financial help from their father, they struggled with a lack of money after their startup expenses. (Shortform note: After the book’s publication, Musk [took to Twitter to clarify how much his father helped financially](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1211064937004589056). He explained that Errol contributed just $20,000 to Zip2 in a round of angel funding that raised $200,000 after the company was already well-established, thus asserting that his father didn’t contribute in a meaningful way.)

Vance describes how they lived at the office and worked long hours to create the initial product. Musk handled the coding while Kimbal focused on sales. They slowly started to build their enterprise and hire a few employees to help with the software and with pitching the idea to businesses. Because businesses were wary of the internet (a relatively new technology at that time), it was challenging to convince the companies to buy a listing on their site for better advertising.

> **Debunking the Entrepreneurial Myth**
> 
> Musk and Kimbal’s creation of Zip2 supports Michael Gerber’s [idea of what he calls the “Entrepreneurial Myth](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-e-myth-revisited/introduction).” In _[The E-Myth Revisited](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-e-myth-revisited)_, Gerber explains that most businesses aren’t started by entrepreneurs with business knowledge but are instead started by people who are good at something and believe their technical skills are all they’ll need to succeed. They acquire business knowledge later—in other words, most entrepreneurs don’t set out specifically to create a business, but instead, to put their idea to work. Gerber argues that the entrepreneurs who succeed are the ones who, like Musk and Kimball, make a point of later acquiring business knowledge to support their idea,
> 
> Musk and Kimbal didn’t start Zip2 with business knowledge or a clear plan—just an idea and some technical skills. They gained business knowledge as they developed their business and used what they learned for future ventures. So while your first venture may not be an immediate success, what you learn from it can help you in the future.

#### Expanding Zip2

Then, in 1996, a venture capital firm heard about the site. After Musk’s sales pitch, the investors were impressed with his energy and his belief in the product. The firm invested $3 million into Zip2. Vance explains that while this was an accomplishment for the company, it brought challenges for Musk. The board brought in new engineers, who made changes to Musk’s code. While the changes improved the software, Musk bristled at his new lack of control and rewrote some of their new code.

(Shortform note: James Kouzes and Barry Posner discuss the danger of trying to exert too much control in their book _[The Leadership Challenge](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge)_. They [warn against the tendency to start micromanaging other peoples’ responsibilities](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/principle-4)—like Musk rewriting his engineers’ code—cautioning that doing so will limit you to the level of a supervisor or manager, and you’ll never rise to the level of a true leader. They argue that a leader is one who can stand back and trust her team, knowing that she’s hired capable people, trained them well, and given them the resources they need to succeed. By allowing other people to make decisions on their own, you’ll build a climate of trust that’s an essential element in a strong organization.)

Zip2 focused on selling software packages to newspapers—including the _New York Times_—and big businesses, giving them a quick and easy way to get online. As the company grew, Musk wanted to make Zip2 into a consumer product, not just one for newspapers and big companies. The executives didn’t want to take this new approach yet, preferring to continue with the plan they already had since they didn’t think a consumer approach would be as profitable.

(Shortform note: Musk foresaw the future of the internet more than the other executives did. In a Twitter post from 2018, Musk explained that [Zip2 was the first company to calculate point-to-point directions](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1005695924318842880?lang=en) in the US and that he did all of the coding prior to the board’s new team of engineers. The fact that ZIp2 was the original maps program indicates that he predicted that the internet would be about democratizing access to information, not just finding ways for businesses to use it.)

Vance explains that the executives eventually gave Musk the role of chief technology officer, not chief executive officer (CEO). In 1998, when Musk urged the board to make him CEO, they declined and revoked his chairman status. They believed Musk didn’t have the experience required to be CEO of a company yet.

Then, in February 1999, Zip2 received a $307 million cash offer from Compaq Computer to buy the company, which they accepted. Musk made $22 million from the deal. He emerged from the venture as a millionaire and with experience bringing a business idea to life.

(Shortform note: While the Musk brothers expanded the Zip2 until it was bought in 1999, [the site fell into obscurity within a few years](https://loopinput.com/this-is-what-elon-musks-first-website-looked-like/). Zip2 was passed from internet company to internet company until it became unrecognizable from the original site. Google Maps has largely replaced Zip2 and other online directories.)

### X.com (Later, PayPal)

With money from the Zip2 deal and insight on how to manage a team, Musk was ready to move on to his next venture. He thought back to his bank internship and his frustration with the bureaucracy of the bank industry. Vance explains that he believed the banking industry needed to modernize and embrace new technology. He decided to create a full-service online bank, complete with checkings and savings accounts, brokerage services, and insurance.

(Shortform note: Musk’s idea for X.com was the product of exploring a way to _combine two ideas_ in a new way and of his _frustration with a deficiency_ in the banking industry, which are two of Charles Duhigg’s [four principles of “productive innovation,” or creativity](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/smarter-faster-better/chapter-5). In _[Smarter Faster Better](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/smarter-faster-better)_, Duhigg explains the other two principles: First, shun clichés, since these ideas don’t feel authentic or meaningful. This means any design or device that is created for convenience rather than because it adds value. Second, remain open to alternative ideas and criticism. Using one or more of these four principles will open you to opportunities to create more inventive solutions.)

In March 1999, Musk incorporated his financial service site, which he named X.com. He put $12 million into X.com, making him the biggest shareholder of his new company. Vance explains that Musk’s personal investment was different from most entrepreneurs at the time, who would typically make a lot of money, and then use their new wealthy status to convince other people to invest in their next venture instead of making a large personal investment themselves. Musk began hiring engineers and seeking venture capital to bring X.com to life.

(Shortform note: Vance writes that Musk’s personal investment was unusual during the dot-com boom, but others note that in general, many entrepreneurs invest their own money into their ventures. According to a 2021 study, [62% of small business owners use their own funds to handle financial problems](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/FedSmallBusiness/files/2021/2021-sbcs-employer-firms-report). However, some experts advise against following this strategy, as the [odds of building a successful business that will support you—both now and through retirement—are low](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201402/scott-leibs/investing-for-entrepreneurs.html). They believe you should still invest in a diverse portfolio to protect yourself against the higher risk of a failed business.)

#### Merging With Confinity

Soon, X.com faced a competitor: Confinity. They had a service called PayPal that completed web-based payments, particularly on sites like eBay. Vance notes that the two companies fought to get the biggest customer base. PayPal appeared to be the more popular product, but it didn’t have the money to stay in business, unlike X.com.

To optimize PayPal’s popularity and X.com’s cash reserves, Confinity and X.com merged. The team cited that they had more than one million customers, but with its popularity came problems. The site was vulnerable to attacks from hackers, it crashed once a week, and the company was losing more money than it was bringing in due to transaction fees and sign-up bonuses. Vance explains that people in the company were uncertain of Musk’s ability to fix these issues.

(Shortform note: Like Musk and the X.com team, Peter Thiel and his PayPal co-founders nonetheless had a [big vision for PayPal](https://shortform.com/app/book/zero-to-one/chapter-2#paypals-launch). In _[Zero to One](https://shortform.com/app/book/zero-to-one)_, he describes how the original idea was to create an internet currency to replace the dollar. The first version of PayPal allowed people to send money from one PalmPilot to another. But not enough people had PalmPilots for that to be viable. Instead, since everyone had email, the company created a way to send payments via email. It worked well, but expenses were growing faster than customers, thus motivating them to partner with X.com.)

#### Leaving PayPal

In September 2000, as he boarded a flight for a delayed honeymoon with his first wife Justine, X.com executives staged a coup to replace Musk as CEO. Vance explains that when he heard this news, Musk took the next flight home to change their minds, but they stood by the decision. He stayed with the company as an advisor and an investor. Soon afterward, they renamed X.com to PayPal.

By July 2001, Musk’s influence at PayPal was fading, and he began to search for his next business venture. In July 2002, PayPal accepted a $1.5 billion offer from eBay. Musk made $250 million from the deal.

(Shortform note: In 2015, [PayPal separated from eBay](https://www.geekwire.com/2015/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ebay-and-paypals-split-and-how-it-impacts-amazon/), allowing both companies to focus on their respective growth. PayPal later launched a peer-to-peer payment option, encouraging a trend toward digital payments.)

Like with Zip2, Musk left the venture with millions of dollars. Vance believes he also had a better understanding of how companies work and experience as a CEO. Once again, he’d proven that he could bring an innovative idea to life.

> **Develop Productive Responses to Failure**
> 
> While it’s easy to look back on Musk’s time at PayPal in the context of his later success with Tesla and SpaceX, his removal as CEO could have been viewed as a failure at the time. And the relationship between entrepreneurs and failures is a familiar one, as Ed Catmull discusses in his book _[Creativity, Inc](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc)_. His main advice is to [stop being afraid of failure](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-3#chapter-7-embracing-failure) and to recognize that failure isn’t inherently bad—it’s a consequence of innovative work. He urges people to normalize failure and to expect it. That way, you’ll see it as merely a part of a larger process rather than an end.
> 
> Illustrating this principle, some CEOs, like Musk, who are removed from their positions—such as [Steve Jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-apple-fired-returned-2017-7)—end up heading another company, while others don’t. This is often determined in large part by how they react to getting fired. People who can put their ego aside and face their mistakes are better off than those who accept long-term defeat or become bitter. While Musk could have viewed his removal as CEO as failure, [his response to the decision was a productive one](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-3#let-your-low-moment-transform-you), since he took the time to reevaluate his priorities and what he wanted his next venture to be.
