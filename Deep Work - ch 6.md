## Chapter 6: Train Your Focus

As we said earlier, most beginners can only do about an hour of deep work at a time, but you can train your brain to focus for longer and longer stretches of time. Newport offers several techniques for this.

### 1) Let Boredom Happen

Newport points out that most people, in idle moments like waiting in line or waiting for the oven to preheat, reflexively pull out their phones for a quick scroll through social media or their texts. He points out that by always filling in these low-stimuli moments with a high-stimuli activity, you deplete your brain’s ability to tolerate boredom.

Even if you set aside time for deep work, you won’t be able to _do_ the work during that time unless you strengthen your brain’s “focus muscles.” Newport suggests consciously letting yourself be bored in these low-stimuli moments.

- For example, if you’re waiting outside of a bar for your friend, consciously resist taking your phone out. Instead, just sit still and take in whatever’s going on around you.

Over time, your brain will be able to go for longer periods of time without seeking high-stimulus activities like scrolling the Internet or looking at your phone.

He describes the Internet as “a little bit of everything, all of the time'' that we’ve become addicted to by design, resulting in a world in which “boredom is a crime.” Warning: Crude language.)

### 2) Define Metrics of Success

Newport suggests creating a clear metric by which you can define the success of your deep work practices. He argues that this practice helps keep you focused on _doing_ your work rather than on what you should be doing with your time or wondering if your results are “enough.”

- For example, you might set a goal to write 500 words every 30 minutes—this way, your task is straightforward and you naturally get two simple progress checks per hour.

(Shortform note: In _[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/parts-7-8)_, Dale Carnegie offers another way that creating metrics of success can keep you on task. He says that setting small goals or challenges makes work—even work that’s cognitively demanding or boring—a bit like an enjoyable game. This can prevent you from becoming bored or zoning out by re-energizing you and re-engaging you with the task. For example, if you’re coming up on 30 minutes with only 400 words written, you’ll likely find finishing those last 100 words an interesting challenge.)

### 3) Practice Productive Meditation

**Newport describes productive meditation as thinking about a problem while doing a low-intensity physical activity, like walking or showering.** This environment helps problem-solving in two ways: First, the activity typically takes you away from distractions like your smartphone. Second, you train your ability to focus on the problem at hand, rather than daydream.

(Shortform note: There are numerous reasons why walking may be a particularly productive way to meditate on problems. Neuroscientist Shane O’Mara hypothesizes that [walking naturally amplifies the neural activation necessary to problem-solving](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/28/its-a-superpower-how-walking-makes-us-healthier-happier-and-brainier). This happens because your cognitive mapping functions—what some might call your “internal GPS”—are supported by the same systems that you use for problem-solving. In other words, reflecting and walking forces your brain to fire on all cylinders to support the two linked functions simultaneously.)

He suggests several practices to ensure that your meditation periods are as productive as possible and help increase your ability to focus on complex problems:

#### 1) Preload the Problem

Don’t go into your productive meditation period empty-headed because you won’t have enough content to work with. Instead, figure out exactly what problem you want to think about in your meditation time. Remember to include variables that need consideration, and what the desired output or the important question is. For example, if you’re working on a book chapter, the variables are the main points you want to make in the chapter. You can then work through how you want to flesh out the main points and sequence them in the chapter.

(Shortform note: Malcolm Gladwell explains in _[Blink that your unconscious mind is constantly taking information that you’ve given it, finding connections within the information, and turning out solutions in the form of sudden insights](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink/chapter-2)_. By preloading a problem and its variables in your mind, you’re feeding your unconscious mind the necessary information to come up with the most relevant and useful connections and insights possible.)

#### 2) Notice When You’ve Lost Focus

Bring your attention gently back to the problem. This trains your mental muscles to focus and resist distraction. (Shortform note: Maintaining focus while meditating can be difficult, especially if you’re the type of person who’s always thinking of their to-do list. To help with this, [try jotting down everything that’s on your mind right before a meditation session](https://www.popsugar.co.uk/fitness/simple-trick-for-staying-focused-during-meditation-47299061?utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=US:FR&utm_source=www.google.com)—this helps get these distracting thoughts out of your head so you can meditate with a “clean slate.”)

#### 3) Beware of “Looping”

Looping is getting stuck on a problem at a superficial level you understand, without diving deep into areas that you’re not sure about. This is a sign that you’re just doing things that are comfortable for you, not making progress on the really difficult and meaningful parts.

(Shortform note: Newport recommends simply acknowledging that you’re in a loop and moving on if this happens. If this step is easier said than done, [you can try two other methods](https://neeramahajan.com/why-cal-newport-is-right-about-productive-meditation/): First, try imagining “What if” scenarios. For example, “What if money wasn’t an issue? Then what would I do?” Second, try to think of ten solutions (even seemingly absurd ones) for the problem to help you unlock any avenues you may be overlooking.)

### 4) Practice Memorization Techniques

Newport argues that if you learn to memorize effectively, you train your concentration muscle so that it spills over into the rest of your work. He points out that memory competition champions seem to do well not because of any innate brain capability, but rather because of their memorization techniques and their ability to focus.

Newport suggests one technique in particular—memorizing the order of 52 shuffled playing cards. He says that through training in this technique daily for months, you’ll increase your ability to do deep work, and you’ll reach increasing levels of focus intensity.

#### How to Train Your Memory With Cards

Because people memorize images far more easily than an abstract string of characters, a particularly useful practice is to associate each card with an image, then memorize the images in order.

- Imagine walking into a house. Picture five rooms in the house.
- Picture 10 objects in each of the five rooms, then two objects in the basement. As you “walk” through the house, memorize the location and the look of each object. (The location of these objects is permanent.)
- Associate each of the 52 cards with a person or thing. For example, the Queen of Diamonds might be Beyoncé. The Jack of spades is Tom Hanks.
- Associate each of the 52 cards with the 52 objects, in the order you’d interact with them as you walk through the house. For example, Beyoncé is in the living room reading a book. Tom Hanks is in the living room sitting on the couch. Once you memorize this, you can “walk” through the house and recall what object is being interacted with by which person, and in this way recall the order of the cards.
- Remember that the objects _don’t move_. When the deck is shuffled, the person (card) interacting with each object changes. For example, once you shuffle the deck, it might be Tilda Swinton sitting on the couch.

In _[Thank You for Arguing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/555278/thank-you-for-arguing-third-edition-by-jay-heinrichs/)_, Jay Heinrichs describes how ancient rhetoricians would construct mental “memory villas,” filled with symbols to help them remember important ideas, rhetorical techniques, and so on. They were focused and powerful in debates because they’d dedicate at least an hour per day to “walking” through their villas and memorizing the different symbols.

### Shortform Commentary: Master Internal Distractions

While Newport discusses ways that minimizing environmental distractions will improve your focus, Nir Eyal points out that [the majority of our distracted behaviors (up to 90% of the time) are due to an internal trigger or discomfort](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-1), such as anxiety, stress, boredom, and so on. He suggests three exercises to help develop your ability to deal with internal discomforts before they become distracted behaviors.

First, take time to meaningfully _reflect_ on your triggers and make more deliberate choices about your response to them. There are three steps to meaningful reflection:

1. Identify the trigger. When you’re about to switch over to a distracting activity, ask yourself what feeling might be driving your actions.
2. Note the trigger in a “distraction notebook” to become more aware of your distraction patterns. Make note of factors like the time of day, where you were, your emotions, what you were doing just before becoming distracted, and the distracting action you took.
3. Commit to fully exploring the internal discomfort that drove you to distraction. Trying to suppress feelings often makes them stronger, while approaching them with curiosity can help them more quickly dissipate.

Second, rethink how you label yourself. You naturally align your behavior to fit the way you see yourself, so refrain from labeling yourself in a self-defeating way—for example, “easily distracted” or “incapable of deep focus.” Instead, label yourself as “focused” or “able to sustain deep work” in order to prompt focused behaviors.
