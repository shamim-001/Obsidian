## Chapter 7: Put Them in the Driver’s Seat

Voss’s fundamental theory of negotiation is that people are driven primarily by their emotional needs for safety and autonomy. They want to feel that they’re in good hands with you, and they want to feel like they’re not being manipulated or coerced into something they don’t want to do. Thus, your job in any successful negotiation first and foremost is to **get your counterpart to a place where they feel secure and in control**.

Up to now, we’ve seen how Voss addresses the “safety and security” part of emotional negotiation through calculated empathy tactics like active listening, tone, reflecting back, labeling, and accusation audits. In this chapter, Voss focuses on autonomy and making your counterpart feel like they’re in the driver’s seat. He explores:

- How open-ended questions can lead your counterpart to your desired outcome while making them think it’s _their_ idea
- Why you should avoid asking questions that are framed solely as requests for concrete information
- How to maintain control of the situation by regulating your _own_ emotions

(Shortform note: We’ve moved Chapter 7 to follow Chapters 1-3 because its discussion of safety and autonomy more naturally follows the analysis of how negotiation is primarily emotion-based and therefore sets up a more logical flow of ideas for the reader.)

### Open-Ended Questions

Voss notes that autonomy is one of the most basic human emotional needs. **As a good negotiator, your goal is to give your counterpart the illusion of control and lead them to your preferred outcome (while letting them think it’s _their_ idea).**

But how do you make them think they’re in the driver’s seat? Voss says you do this by asking open-ended “how” or “what” questions. These kinds of questions ask the other person for help in coming up with solutions, which gets them to start seeing the situation from your point of view. It's the first step in dissolving the confrontational, win-lose dynamic that too many negotiations naturally fall into.

For example, if you’re confronted with a price that’s too high or an offer that’s unreasonably low, respond with a simple, “How can I do that?” **These straightforward, yet seemingly innocuous questions can be the golden key in a negotiation**.

Voss recommends other good open-ended questions like, “How do you expect me to be able to follow through on that?” or “What are you hoping to accomplish?”

Voss notes that these “how” or “what” questions are different from more accusatory questions that begin with more loaded words like “why.” “Why” can be a very problematic word in negotiations, warns Voss. “Why” puts the onus on your counterpart, shines a light on them, and makes them feel like they’re in the hot seat—which takes them out of their comfort zone and into a place where they’re no longer in control. This is exactly where Voss says you _don’t_ want them to be.

For example, think of the enormously different emotional weight between a non-open-ended “why” question like “Why would you say that?” and an open-ended “what” question like “What makes you say that?” The former is accusatory and borderline hostile; the latter is empathetic, welcoming of insight, and devoid of any emotional sting.

> **Asking the Right Negotiation Questions**
> 
> Other negotiation experts back up Voss’s insights about asking open-ended questions, arguing that such questions are essential in order to glean valuable information from your counterpart. They warn that [your counterpart will be reluctant to divulge information if they think you’re trying to exploit or take advantage of them](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/ask-better-questions-in-negotiation-nb/), but asking the right kind of questions can prevent this.
> 
> Experts recommend asking questions that enable you to present yourself as someone trying to gather information for a mutually beneficial solution, rather than someone trying to outwit them in a zero-sum competition. They advise asking open-ended questions to elicit more comprehensive responses; interjecting with probing responses like “I see” or “Tell me more”; and asking neutral, non-leading questions (like “Can you tell me about your semiconductor sourcing?”), while combining them with explanations like, “We’ve found that some clients prefer having a standing meeting every month, whereas others prefer to schedule them on an as-needed basis. Could you give me some insight on which meeting structure works best for you and why?” The goal is to put your counterpart at ease so that they see you as a helper, not an adversary.

#### Put Them to Work for You

According to Voss, the key strategic benefit of **open-ended questions is that they put your counterpart to work helping _you._** When you ask an open-ended “how” or “what” question, you’re putting the other person in a position where _they’re_ providing solutions to _your_ problems. In doing so, you’re leading them along to the conclusion that you want them to reach—all the while convincing them that your desired solution is _their_ idea.

This also helps with the implementation of the decision. Your counterpart will buy into it and commit to it because they’ll think _they_ came up with it. In this scenario, they’re the teacher and you’re the student. This gives them a powerful feeling of being in charge. But **_you’re_ really in control as the listener, because they’re giving _you_ information you need.**

Voss writes that open-ended questions also prompt longer answers from your counterpart—which, in turn, reveal key information. Your counterpart might reveal what they _really_ desire out of a negotiation or what a potential dealbreaker might be. They might also reveal the challenges they face in actually _delivering_ on the terms you’re negotiating (like, for example, a salesperson whose boss won’t allow them to sell you an item for under a certain amount).

(Shortform note: Other writers have backed up Voss’s ideas about inverting someone else’s mental process, planting an idea in their head, and making them think it was their _own_ original idea. In [Unconscious Branding: How Neuroscience Can Empower (and Inspire) Marketing](https://www.allencheng.com/unconscious-branding-book-summary-douglas-van-praet/#Big_Idea_9_Lead_your_customers_to_an_action_and_theyll_convince_themselves_theyre_in_control_But_you_are), author Douglas Van Praet writes that when marketers give customers an active role in how they experience and consume a product, it’s more effective than conventional marketing or advertising because it allows customers to form their own unique associations with the product. They’ll be more inclined to consume and purchase it, thinking that this is an intrinsic choice they’re making—but in fact, the positive associations were guided by external marketers. For example, Red Bull built relationships with college students by offering them cases of the energy drink and letting them organize events where they could consume it.)

#### Staying Out of Their Debt

Crucially, as Voss argues, open-ended questions allow you to get information without then being obligated to reveal information. **Straight requests for information can lead to an unproductive tit-for-tat dynamic, where the other side expects some sort of reciprocity** (e.g., “I gave _you_ something, now you give _me_ something.”

A straight request for information is something that can either be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” or just a literal, minimal response. Questions like, “Does this apartment have a washer-dryer?” or “When were the windows in this apartment last cleaned?” yield nothing beyond the literal information requested (information that you can often obtain on your own without asking). Instead of putting your counterpart to work for you, writes Voss, **you’re setting up the expectation that you’ll pay _them_ back with information of your own**. And if your counterpart is really a savvy negotiator, they’ll ask for information that’s highly valuable to _you_.

Voss argues that open-ended questions free you from this dynamic because they come across as natural, normal, conversational questions instead of requests for information. “How can we get this to work?” doesn’t have the tit-for-tat feel. You’re asking without directly asking.

> **When Tit-for-Tat Works**
> 
> Other theorists of negotiation take the opposite assessment of Voss when it comes to “tit-for-tat” or mutual retaliation strategies. In _[The Evolution of Cooperation](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/robert-axelrod/the-evolution-of-cooperation/9780465005642/)_, author Robert Axelrod demonstrated that a tit-for-tat strategy was actually the most optimal in negotiating the classic “Prisoner’s Dilemma” game theory problem, with major ramifications for real-world negotiation strategy.
> 
> In the “Prisoner’s Dilemma,” two criminal accomplices are being interrogated by the authorities. The optimal outcome _for the pair_ is if neither one of them informs on the other. However, if one prisoner decides to give evidence against his accomplice (while the accomplice, meanwhile, says nothing), the turncoat does the best of all—receiving a light sentence, while his tight-lipped accomplice takes the full rap. However, if they _both_ finger each other for the crime, _each_ of them receive a worse outcome than they would have if they’d both stayed silent. The dilemma shows a scenario in which two parties acting purely in their self-interest do _not_ produce the optimal outcome.
> 
> After conducting a Prisoner’s Dilemma tournament with hundreds of contestants, Axelrod concluded that mutual cooperation at the outset followed by a tit-for-tat strategy produced the best outcome. The most successful contestants began with a mutual, cooperative strategy, but then made sure to properly match what their counterpart did at every turn (i.e., tit-for-tat). Thus, if one partner defected from the agreed-upon strategy by giving evidence to the police in Round One, the other’s best move was to respond with a defection of their own in Round Two.
> 
> Axelrod argued that this provided a model for how counterparts should behave in real-world negotiations—start off cooperating; be clear about your actions; “defect” (appropriately and proportionately) from the cooperative strategy when your counterpart does so; back off of your defection if and when your counterpart adjusts their behavior; and accept that there does not have to be a clear winner or loser in the negotiation (you “win” even if only _some_ of your needs are met and you’re better off than you were before, regardless of whether or not your counterpart got more).

### Stay In Control

With all of this focus on taking advantage of _your counterpart’s_ emotions, Voss cautions that you also must remember to regulate your _own_ emotions. **Don’t get angry**. Open-ended questions, reflecting back, labeling, anticipating accusations, and everything else will fail if you’re overly emotional. You’ll only heighten the emotional stakes of the negotiation and encourage your counterpart to respond in kind.

**Voss advises hitting the pause button if you feel yourself getting too emotional.** Let the passion dissipate. Don’t respond to your counterpart’s provocations with outbursts of your own. He warns that this may be part of a deliberate strategy on their part—trying to rattle you to force you into counterproductive moves. Don’t make the mistake of playing into their hands.

(Shortform note: Staying calm may have the added benefit of rattling your counterpart and increasing your power. In _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)_ (2000), author Robert Greene argues that everyone seeks power on some level and that if you’re not a power player, you’re simply a pawn in someone else’s game. He writes that since you can’t opt out of the competition for power, you’re better off becoming a master player by learning the rules and strategies practiced since ancient times. One of his laws is to rattle your opponents by always staying calm and objective. When you get angry, writes Greene, you’ve surrendered control. But if you can make your enemies angry, you gain the advantage.)
