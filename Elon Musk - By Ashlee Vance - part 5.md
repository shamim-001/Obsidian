## Part 5: Musk’s Traits

Musk’s unique combination of personal traits helped him build his companies. In this section, we’ll discuss the traits that helped Musk succeed, beginning with his future-oriented mindset.

### Future-Oriented Motivations

Vance believes Musk’s goals and actions are all motivated by the future. He puts present-day concerns aside to create a better future for humanity. Musk believes the survival of the human race depends on becoming a multiplanetary species—or living on Mars—and by creating sources of sustainable energy. The missions of Tesla and SpaceX are based on those two goals. Musk’s future-oriented mindset doesn’t prioritize his companies’ financial success over his goal to improve the future—to him, these aspects are inherently tied together.

In 2014, he revealed that Tesla would open-source all of its patents, meaning they’d be available to the public. This might seem like an unwise business decision, since Tesla would be giving competitors the blueprint to making great electric cars. But Musk believed it was the right thing to do. By sharing Tesla’s technology and ideas, it would speed up the process for other car companies to develop their own electric vehicles, thus encouraging consumers to transition away from fossil fuels. Musk believed moving to sustainable energy was more important for the future than hoarding valuable information for profit.

> **A Future Mindset Helps Musk’s Infinite Game**
> 
> In prioritizing the future, Musk is thinking of the “infinite game.” In _[The Infinite Game](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-infinite-game)_, Simon Sinek explores the differences between finite games—where players play to win—and [infinite games—where players play to survive, thrive, and keep playing the game](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-infinite-game#two-games-finite-and-infinite).
> 
> Sinek discusses Musk’s decision to release Tesla’s patents as a smart move for an infinite game. Musk saw his real competition not as other electric car _companies_, but as a lack of a full electric car _market_—so in releasing his technology, he hoped to create an industry and thus foster worthy rivals. Being the only player would have hurt him in the long run, as it wouldn’t have fostered innovation or competition. Worthy rivals help you focus on improving and the process, rather than winning and the outcome.
> 
> Tesla’s infinite-minded move aligns with Sinek’s concept of viewing competitors as worthy rivals, but with a caveat: While Musk sees other EV brands as worthy rivals, he views combustion-engine brands as rivals to beat. His sharing of patents is clearly aimed at putting EV engines in a stronger competitive position to combustion engines in a win-or-lose game. In this way, Musk seems to play both an infinite and a finite game at the same time. Yet this finite game also fits within Musk’s ultimate infinite game—humanity’s survival.

#### The Common Good vs. The Individual

Vance explains that Musk is more concerned about the future of humanity as a whole than about one person’s needs. While this belief affects Musk’s business decisions, it also directly impacts his work ethic, as well as his employees. Vance believes he puts humanity’s needs ahead of his own, driving him to work nonstop, sleep on couches, experience weight fluctuations due to stress, and rarely take vacations.

But his mentality doesn’t always leave a good impression on his employees, causing Musk to seem callous toward individual employees, and he has been accused of a lack of loyalty and a harsh leadership style.

For instance, Vance describes how one employee missed a Tesla event to witness his child’s birth. Musk expressed his disappointment and told this employee to consider where his priorities were. This incident demonstrates how his beliefs don’t favor the individual in a compassionate way.

(Shortform note: Following the book’s publication, [Musk denied this claim in a series of tweets](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-email-tesla-employee-2015-5), stating that the biography was never independently fact-checked and that he supports pregnancy-leave. Vance responded to Musk’s denial, saying he stands by everything he reported in the book.)

> **Should We Rely on Billionaire Philanthropy?**
> 
> While Vance argues that Musk is more concerned with the greater good than the individual, Musk’s status as [one of the richest people in the world might seem to inherently contradict this idea](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012715/5-richest-people-world.asp#toc-1-elon-musk). Some people point out that if he really was concerned about other people's well-being, [he could do much more than he currently does philanthropically](https://www.vox.com/recode/22221173/elon-musk-tesla-foundation-philanthropy-wealthiest-person).
> 
> To his credit, Musk seems open to the idea of using his wealth for a more tangible philanthropic mission than traveling to Mars. In 2021, he set up a [$100 million carbon-removal prize](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk).
> 
> But, other actions of his hint at less altruistic motives: that same year, the [UN challenged Musk on Twitter](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/elon-musk-un-world-hunger-famine/) to give $6 billion to stop world hunger. Musk said he would sell Tesla stock and donate the money if the UN could provide a detailed plan of how that money would be used. The UN eventually responded with a plan. Soon afterward, records revealed that Musk had indeed sold almost $6 billion worth of Tesla stock to donate it—but there was no evidence of where this money was donated. Experts believe [Musk may have placed it in a donor-advised fund](https://time.com/6148841/elon-musk-donation/) (or DAF)—not the UN—which is a kind of investment account where investors can claim an upfront tax deduction with the promise that the money will eventually go to charity.
> 
> This sequence of events [sparked a debate about philanthropy](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/elon-musks-5-7b-donation-sparks-questions-about-giving/) and led people to question how much of any billionaire’s donations—not just Musk’s—actually make it to the public.

### Desire to Improve

Vance believes that Musk is motivated by the idea that things and industries can be improved. He doesn’t accept anything as perfect or good enough. Instead he looks for innovative ways to enhance industries and products using new technologies.

On a large scale, Musk saw room for improvement in big industries that had stopped evolving.

- He saw flaws in the banking industry, since banks hadn’t adapted to the internet at the time. In response, he created X.com.
- He also believed American interest in space exploration had faltered, so he created SpaceX and built rockets.
- He recognized the limitations of gasoline cars and the automotive industry, so he worked to ensure Tesla succeeded with its electric cars.

Vance explains that Musk applies his mindset of improvement to how he runs his companies. Musk doesn’t believe in doing the bare minimum, and he seeks ways to improve the technologies he builds and how he builds them.

For example, Musk wanted SpaceX to use friction stir welding for rocket development. This is a process that joins pieces of metal, allowing for stronger and lighter metal bodies of the rockets. But before SpaceX, companies hadn’t tried this technique for rockets. Despite it adding an extra step to production, Musk saw ways to improve even basic parts of the rocket.

However, Vance notes that this trait can come across as perfectionism. Since Musk values every detail of his companies and products, his mentality often results in high standards for his employees. For example, employees who had typos in their emails were fired. While this trait benefits him in some ways, it makes Musk difficult to work for.

(Shortform note: Like Musk’s companies, many work cultures are characterized by perfectionism, which can stifle a work culture’s creativity and learning. In _[Dare to Lead](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, Brene Brown argues that these behaviors are toxic to the potential for innovation. The antidote to a stifled work culture is brave leadership, where leaders approach fear and uncertainty head-on, and they teach their teams how to do the same. Musk’s workplaces seem to function despite his perfectionism, and this may be due to his brave leadership—his perfectionism leads him to action, not inaction.)

> **Using an Eye for Improvement to Create a Blue Ocean**
> 
> Musk’s desire to improve seems crucial to his ability to create what authors W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne call [blue oceans, or an uncontested and innovative market](https://shortform.com/app/book/blue-ocean-strategy/part-1) (versus [red oceans](https://shortform.com/app/book/blue-ocean-strategy/part-1#the-problem-with-red-oceans), which are markets where there is fierce competition and a lack of innovation). His success lies in finding opportunities to make blue oceans out of red oceans, like the car, banking, and space industries.
> 
> In _[Blue Ocean Strategy](https://shortform.com/app/book/blue-ocean-strategy)_, the authors explain that markets are dynamic, demand-driven, and can often be reshaped by market players—like Tesla or SpaceX—to expose new demand. If a company can create new market sectors for itself, it can profit from them without having to displace a competitor. They believe blue ocean strategy focuses on creating new demand in uncontested market spaces, leading to profitable growth—in Musk’s case, he was able to do this with his companies.

### Ability to Handle Stress

Vance explains that one of Musk’s most distinct traits is his ability to handle extreme amounts of stress. He perseveres even when a situation gets difficult. Musk credits this ability to having a rough childhood and learning to endure hard circumstances.

He frequently used this ability, given the high-stakes nature of his businesses. But on top of the stress of his financial situation and companies, Musk experienced stress from the death of his first child, the scrutiny of the press, and his divorce. Most of these incidents happened in 2008, when both SpaceX and Tesla faced bankruptcy. While most people would have broken down from this amount of stress, Musk kept moving forward.

> **Practice Stress Exposure Training**
> 
> Vance argues that Musk has an innate ability to handle high amounts of stress, unlike most people. If you’d like to build your stress tolerance, research shows that forms of “[stress exposure training](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-06532-007)” or “stress inoculation” methods can help with this and is shown to help athletes, military personnel, surgeons, and others perform better in stressful situations.
> 
> [Formal stress exposure training](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Szalma/publication/242493355_Efficacy_of_Transfer_in_Simulation-Based_Training_Implications_for_Stress_Exposure_Training/links/02e7e52d9683276b1a000000/Efficacy-of-Transfer-in-Simulation-Based-Training-Implications-for-Stress-Exposure-Training.pdf) is usually a three-phase program: First, instructors teach you about the psychological and physiological effects of stress. Then, they teach you coping mechanisms to deal with the stress in the situations you are likely to encounter. Finally, they try to simulate the stressful situation in question so you can practice under realistic conditions.
> 
> However, you don’t need a formal training program to practice handling stress. In _[A Mind For Numbers](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-mind-for-numbers)_, Barbara Oakley suggests [putting yourself in everyday situations that are mildly stressful to you](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-mind-for-numbers/part-8#study-with-groups), such as giving a speech or taking on a challenging task at work, so you can practice handling stress and build up your tolerance for it.

### High Risk Tolerance

Musk’s ability to handle stress complements his high risk tolerance. This means he doesn’t create any safety nets for himself should he fail. This mindset has given him an edge in his professional life. He’s willing to risk everything—his money, his possessions, his health, and so on—to make his vision a reality. Most people would find this level of risk extremely stressful, but Musk sees it as necessary in order to achieve his goals. He’s willing to invest all of his time and money into his businesses for the possibility of even bigger gains.

When starting his companies, he invested almost all of his money into his ventures. When both SpaceX and Tesla had financial problems in 2008, Musk sold his car and other possessions for extra money so he could keep the companies afloat. While Musk faced the possibility of losing everything, his hard work paid off, and he has seen a great reward from the risks he took.

> **Develop Your Risk Tolerance**
> 
> While Musk believes in and encourages others to take risks—especially when they’re young—not everyone has his natural high level of risk tolerance. In _[Who Will Cry When You Die](https://shortform.com/app/book/who-will-cry-when-you-die)_, Robin Sharma notes that [taking risks is beneficial in life](https://shortform.com/app/book/who-will-cry-when-you-die/tactic-2#strategy-3-take-risks-and-seek-adventure) as well as business, since you’ll experience more of life and live with fewer regrets.
> 
> You may struggle to take more risks and be more adventurous if you’re naturally risk-averse. While you can’t eradicate your risk aversion, you can hone your risk-taking skills so that, moving forward, you build up your risk tolerance:
> 
> - Practice with low-risk and low-pressure decisions. Take the risk of purchasing a new toothpaste brand, for instance.
>     
> - Create a pros and cons list and weigh them against each other.
>     
> - Don’t fixate on the worst-case scenario. This may stymie you, and the worst-case scenario is unlikely to occur.
>     
> - Think like someone else. Limit your natural risk aversion by adopting a persona when making decisions. Approach decisions as a world-famous rock star, for instance.
>     

### Ability to Situate the Details Within the Big Picture

Musk often thinks in terms of the big picture, such as changing the aerospace industry or revolutionizing clean energy. He sets large goals for himself and his businesses. But while Musk is a big picture thinker, he also doesn’t underestimate the importance of small details, which enhance his end product. He knows that small parts make up the larger whole. By perfecting all of the details, Musk built better overall products.

For example, at Tesla, Musk wanted to build a great car, not just a functional electric car. To him, this meant perfecting the electric car technology, as well as adding other new features that would improve a car. He wanted hidden door handles that emerged when the driver got close to the car, and he worked on new, distinct designs for the body of the car. Musk’s attention to detail and commitment to big goals pushed the company to success.

> **Navigate the Levels of Detail**
> 
> Musk’s ability to situate details into the bigger picture may stem from an [ability to understand situations and decisions at multiple levels of detail](https://shortform.com/app/book/principles-life-and-work/chapter-11#understand-the-situation). In _[Principles: Life and Work](https://shortform.com/app/book/principles-life-and-work/1-page-summary)_, Ray Dalio explains that there is a top level of the most important points, as well as lower levels of supporting detail. Whenever you make a decision, you should be clear about what level of detail you’re on. For example, here are levels of detail for someone who’s deciding about a career:
> 
> **High level, big picture**: I want to do work that provides personal meaning and lets me engage directly with people.
> 
> **Supporting picture**: I want to become a doctor.
> 
> **Subpoint**: I need to get into medical school.
> 
> **Sub-subpoint**: I need to get a good GPA in college.
> 
> **Sub-sub-subpoint**: I shouldn’t go out and party tonight; I should study.
> 
> The lower levels of detail support the higher levels and form a complete logical picture. It’s important to see these different levels, rather than seeing all the points as a random pile of facts with no greater logic. Musk balances these levels of details efficiently when making decisions for his companies.

### Desire to Learn

According to Vance, Musk embraces being a lifelong learner. He is curious about the way things work, which makes him willing to learn new, complex subjects. His willingness to learn new subjects enables him to enter a complex industry or topic without any background knowledge.

Musk exhibited a desire to learn with all of his businesses. He learned about finance with X.com, rocket engineering with SpaceX, and electric cars with Tesla. Consequently, Musk has a deep understanding of these industries, of how his products work, and of almost every aspect of his companies.

Musk has found a way to learn subjects quickly, without taking courses or hiring tutors. He believes asking the right questions to the right people is more important than having the right answer. By asking people the right questions, Musk gets to the heart of issues and topics, allowing him to learn what the other person knows.

Musk’s employees explained that Musk would ask them questions and have them explain how something worked. At first, this made the employees nervous that Musk was testing them. But after time, they realized that he was trying to absorb the knowledge they had so he could understand what they were working on. This approach allows him to fill in the gaps of his knowledge and learn from people who know more about a subject than he does. By doing this, Musk gained a holistic understanding of his companies and products.

> **Musk: An Ultralearner**
> 
> Like Musk’s style of self-directed learning, Scott Young presents his idea of ultralearning to master any skill, advance your career, or stay relevant in your field. In _[Ultralearning](https://shortform.com/app/book/ultralearning)_, he defines [ultralearning as a strategic approach to learning that is intensive and self-directed](https://shortform.com/app/book/ultralearning/chapters-1-3), meaning you should take a disciplined approach to learning as deeply as possible at an accelerated pace. Ultralearning should also be tailored to you and your own learning style.
> 
> There are many variations of ultralearning, but ultralearners share several characteristics:
> 
> - They work independently (but not necessarily alone). Musk often works with and manages his teams, but he always works as a capable unit within that team.
>     
> - They’re obsessive about improving their learning process. Musk found new ways to expand his knowledge, including asking his employees to explain things to him.
>     
> - They’re motivated primarily by a love of learning, not by the prestige of credentialed achievements.
>     
> - They constantly push the limits of their intellectual comfort zones. Musk took on increasingly more difficult topics, from banking regulations to rocket science.
>     

### DIY Work Ethic

Musk has a do-it-yourself attitude toward his work, meaning that if he wants something done and he knows how to do it, he’ll do it himself. As part of his DIY mentality, Musk learned to take on many different roles in each of his companies. Even if a task isn’t one typically done by a CEO, he’ll complete it. His job is to fulfill the company’s mission, not be confined by roles.

Musk thinks it’s important that his employees know that he’s working just as hard as he expects them to work. His work ethic is a testament to his belief in their mission. This effort has paid off, because his employees and people close to him note that he’s an extremely hard worker. They admire that he’s not afraid to do any job, even working on the factory floor to test a valve seal.

However, not everyone appreciates this approach. Some employees find this tactic abrasive. For example, employees at Zip2 would return to their work to find that Musk had gone in and changed their code while they were gone. To them, this was rude and made their effort feel like a waste of time. To Musk, this was the quickest fix to the problem he’d noticed. He knew he could fix it and didn’t consider how it would make his employees feel.

> **Honoring the Technician Role**
> 
> Musk’s DIY work ethic is reminiscent of Michael Gerber’s idea of the _technician_ in _[The E-Myth Revisited](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-e-myth-revisited)_. The technician is an individualist and a doer who produces the product or service, taking a tactical approach focused on the work that needs to be done. Experts echo the importance of Gerber’s idea of the technician role—which often goes overlooked once the company starts succeeding—noting that [a good business leader can complete any job in the company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90283073/four-reasons-leaders-shouldnt-be-scared-to-do-dirty-work). Musk doesn’t slack in his technician role, despite his business’ success.
> 
> Gerber explains the [three roles or mindsets every business owner needs to cultivate to run a successful business](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-e-myth-revisited#three-roles). A business won’t succeed if its leader fulfills just one role—it takes all three to succeed: creating a vision (entrepreneur), translating your vision into action through systems and processes (manager), and getting the work done (technician). As in the case of Musk, when all three roles are balanced, the business can succeed.
