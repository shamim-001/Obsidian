## Chapter 6: Predicting the Past

Through the limitations of inductive reasoning as illustrated by the turkey anecdote, as well as the distortions of the narrative fallacy and silent evidence, we’ve seen how problematic the past is vis-à-vis prediction. **But because of these phenomena and others, the past _itself_ is as unknowable as the future**.

One of the major obstacles that prevents us from knowing the past with certainty is the impossibility of reverse engineering causes for events. That is, there’s no way to determine the precise cause of an event when we work backward in time from the event itself.

An example should help illustrate.

Think of an ice cube sitting on a table. Imagine the shape of the puddle that ice cube will make as it melts.

Now think of a puddle on the table and try to imagine how that puddle got there.

The second thought experiment is much harder than the first. With the right physics know-how and ample time, one could model exactly what kind of puddle will result from the melting ice cube (based on the cube’s shape, the environmental conditions, etc.). In contrast, it’s nearly impossible to reverse engineer a cause from a random puddle (because the puddle could have been caused by any number of things).

When historians propose causes for certain historical events, they’re looking at puddles and imagining ice cubes (or a spilled glass of water, or some other cause). The problem is that the sheer number of possible causes for a puddle—or a historical event—render any ascription of cause suspect.

Poincaré’s nonlinearities too help illustrate this problem. Again, with the right tools and time, one might be able to observe how the flutter of a butterfly’s wings in India causes a hurricane in Florida, **but it would be impossible to work backwards from the hurricane to that cause—there are just too many _other_ tiny events that may have played a part**.

### Our Information Is Always Incomplete

Mathematicians and philosophers draw a distinction between “true randomness” and “deterministic chaos.” A “random” system is one whose operation is always and forever impossible to predict. A “chaotic” system is one whose operation _could_ be predicted, but whose complexity makes prediction so difficult that it’s effectively impossible. That is, if we had the right information, we would be able to make sense of “chaos.”

Taleb notes that, for normal people trying to make predictions about their stock portfolio, for example, or the appreciation of the value of their house, there’s no difference between “true randomness” and “deterministic chaos.” **That’s because when we’re faced with a dynamical system, we _always_ lack the necessary information to decide whether it’s truly random or simply chaotic.**

Such is the case with history as well: Perhaps each major historical event conforms to some incredibly complex plan—that is, perhaps history is just chaotic, not random—**but we’ll _never have enough information_ to discern that plan**.

### The Proper Use of History

Historical narratives are harmless if understood properly: as windows on to how human beings used to live and think rather than a source of actionable knowledge.

When we platonify history by treating it systematically, we let ourselves in for trouble. **We must be forever vigilant against (1) isolating causes for particular events and (2) using the past events and outcomes to guide our present and future choices.**
