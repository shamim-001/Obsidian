## Chapter 2: Working With Great People

Starting from just Dalio, Bridgewater grew to 738 employees by 2008. Dalio says that this growth presented a dilemma: On one hand, it gave them a greater advantage with more talent. On the other hand, the influx of large numbers of new team members threatened their culture—there was reduced openness and engagement because it wasn’t possible for everyone to attend every meeting. Having to oversee more people also distracted the managers from the firm’s actual work.

(Shortform note: As Bridgewater’s example shows, growth has its pros and cons. Small businesses can [manage the possible drawbacks of this growth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/03/19/five-basic-strategies-to-manage-business-growth/?sh=817df89174c5) in three ways: first, by hiring people who reflect the company’s vision and values; second, by re-evaluating your finances and budget plan; third, by using data to determine your strengths and leverage them; and fourth, by adjusting practices and processes to meet new demands.)

### Innovations in Management Tools

To preserve the Bridgewater culture as the firm grew, Dalio introduced five management tools:

#### Management Tool #1: Public Work Principles

Dalio kept careful notes of his principles and added more as he encountered new management situations. These included perspectives on hiring, firing, and compensation. Dalio shared these principles with Bridgewater managers, asking them to test them and refine them over time. With a large enough list of principles, no work situation was novel, and managers could make decisions without asking Dalio for advice.

New hires were given the principles and acclimated to them over 18 to 24 months. The principles enabled management at scale—anyone who had good character traits and followed the principles could be granted a large amount of autonomy and be trusted to make the right decisions.

> **Successful Companies Have a Cult-Like Culture**
> 
> While this strict adherence to the principles has [led some to describe Bridgewater as a cult](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/ray-dalio-is-bringing-his-cult-to-silicon-valley), extreme measures to ensure employees are fully aligned with the company culture aren’t unusual in business. In _[Built to Last](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last)_, Jim Collins describes the [cult-like practices and characteristics of successful companies](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last/chapters-6-7):
> 
> - They have a tough screening process to ensure that new recruits are a seamless fit.
>     
> - They indoctrinate employees by requiring them to attend orientation seminars.
>     
> - They try to make employees feel like they’re part of an elite group.
>     
> 
> Successful companies do all this not to turn people into robots, but to ensure that employees strongly adhere to the company’s core philosophy and can thus be trusted to work autonomously.

#### Management Tool #2: Recording All Meetings

A key element of Bridgewater’s culture is extreme transparency (what Dalio calls “radical transparency”): Everyone should know how everyone else feels about everything.

When Bridgewater was small, this was easy to manage. But as the company grew, it was impossible to attend all the meetings and listen to all the informal conversations. This threatened extreme transparency because private conversations and office politics could skew the message.

To counter this, Dalio mandated that all meetings be recorded and accessible to anyone who wanted to listen to them. The only exceptions were personally sensitive meetings or confidential proprietary information. Having all meetings accessible allowed people to review why others made the decisions they did and formed valuable case studies for training new employees.

> **When Extreme Transparency Is Not Ideal**
> 
> Other companies also employ some form of extreme transparency. For example, [Patagonia practices “brand transparency](https://www.fastcompany.com/1749656/patagonia-power-brand-transparency)”, allowing customers to access slides and interviews that discuss both good and bad qualities of their products. However, a high level of transparency is not appropriate for every situation (as even Dalio concedes). There are [three areas where transparency can create problems](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-dark-side-of-transparency):
> 
> - Day-to-day activities where getting more people to weigh in isn’t only unnecessary but may also bog down decision-making
>     
> - Salary information, which could breed resentment if pay isn’t clearly connected to employees’ performance
>     
> - Creative work, where privacy can actually help improve performance—a communications agency found that bringing in clients early in the process for the sake of transparency can disrupt idea generation
>     
> 
> Before introducing more transparency into your team’s workflow, carefully consider the impact. Ask yourself: How could this change slow down productivity or create negative feelings? Do the benefits of this transparency outweigh the costs?

#### Management Tool #3: Psychometric Testing

Dalio says that people think and behave in very different ways. Understanding what type of person you are, and what type of people your co-workers are, is critical to working well together.

To determine potential employees’ personality types, Bridgewater has them undergo psychometric assessments, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The information allows the firm to determine which jobs are best suited to the applicants.

(Shortform note: [Eighty-nine of the Fortune 100 companies use the Myers-Briggs test](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/10/30/myers-briggs-system-evaluate-employees/), whether during the hiring process or in training. But [experts have disregarded this test](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless) for several reasons. Apart from being developed by people who had no formal training in psychology, it’s also based on untested theories, produces inconsistent results, and [relies solely on binary outcomes](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific)—you’re either introverted _or_ extroverted, feeling _or_ thinking, nothing in between.)

#### Management Tool #4: Personality Profiles

Dalio found that just knowing employees’ personality types wasn’t enough to form a clear picture of what they were like. People would enter meetings and ignore each other’s personality differences, assuming everyone was equally good at all tasks and assigning jobs to people who didn’t have the right skills. For example, someone who didn’t care about details might be given detail-oriented tasks.

To make the differences between his people’s skills and abilities more explicit, Dalio started making personality profiles (what he called “baseball cards”) that showed each person’s strengths and weaknesses, along dimensions like inquisitiveness, outgoingness, conflict resolution ability, and assertiveness. He’d compare data from the personality profiles with the key qualities necessary to different tasks to decide which people were best suited for which jobs.

This level of transparency met with resistance at first because people were afraid that their profile would misrepresent or pigeonhole them. However, over time the Bridgewater team found it freeing because they could be true to themselves and not have to hide their weaknesses.

(Shortform note: While Dalio believes that showing and discussing weaknesses is important, a study suggests that [being vulnerable can undermine your credibility](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/workplace-vulnerability-leaders-lose-authority.html#:~:text=As%20she%20argues%2C%20allowing%20ourselves,re%20in%20a%20leadership%20position.) if you’re in a leadership position. So, instead of showing everyone how vulnerable you are, author Brené Brown suggests [having a small group of people that you can confide in](https://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/leadership-why-the-best-leaders-are-vulnerable.html). That way, you still reap some benefits of showing weaknesses, but you protect your wider reputation.)

#### Management Tool #5: Using Algorithms for Management

Dalio aims to automate Bridgewater’s management system just as he did their investment system. He writes that they still have a long way to go, but they’ve started with tools like an app that all employees run on their iPads, allowing them to rate other employees in real time during meetings. They rate attributes such as expertise in the topic area, creativity, and open-mindedness. Over many meetings, the app collates these ratings to create a clear representation of each person’s strengths and weaknesses, showing which persons are most credible in specific areas.

(Shortform note: Some companies have taken management automation a step further, [replacing human managers with artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon) to optimize productivity. AI can measure everything from productivity to empathy, as in the case of call center workers who are rated based on the emotions they exhibit during a call. The main concern with this method is that robot managers try to create “robot employees”—that is, they try to make workers keep up an untenable pace, require them to display just the right amount of emotion dictated by an algorithm, and subject them to injury, burnout, and a loss of autonomy in the quest for hyper-efficiency.)
