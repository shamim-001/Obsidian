# Why We Sleep

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Part 2: The Importance of Sleep | Chapter 6: How Sleep Benefits the Brain

Walker says that getting good sleep improves your brain in three ways:

#### 1) Sleep Improves Long-term Factual Recall

Your brain stores different memories in different places. The hippocampus stores short-term memory with a limited capacity; the cortex stores long-term memory in a large storage bank.

The slow-wave, pulsating NREM sleep moves facts from the hippocampus to the cortex. This has two positive effects: 1) It secures memories for the long term, and 2) it clears out short-term memory to make room for new information, improving future learning.

Have you ever woken up recalling facts that you couldn’t recall before sleeping? Walker says this happens because sleep may make corrupted memories accessible again.

(Shortform note: Sleeping for _too_ long may have an interesting effect on memory, as in the case of a [man from North London who was in a coma for three weeks](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2016/07/09/the-man-with-made-memories/1bXr53yLgye88yCJ859dqN/story.html#comments). He woke up with memories of things that didn’t really happen—going on an interview with MI6, owning a private plane, and expecting twins with his girlfriend. One possible theory is that his brain was trying to fill that three-week gap with made-up memories based on real memories that he had stored, such as a plane he saw in a movie and friends having twins.)

#### 2) Sleep Prunes Memories Worth Forgetting

Sleep doesn’t preserve all memories equally strongly—Walker says that somehow, the brain knows which memories are useful and worth preserving, and which ones are useless and discardable.

This has been shown in experiments where subjects are given a list of words and instructed which words to remember and which to forget. Students who get to take a nap show stronger memories for the appropriate words, compared to students who don’t nap.

(Shortform note: A 2019 study on mice found that [melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons helped the brain forget unimportant information](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/brain-may-actively-forget-during-dream-sleep) during REM sleep. This could help researchers better understand—and possibly come up with treatments for—memory-related diseases and disorders.)

#### 3) Sleep Increases “Muscle Memory” or Motor Task Proficiency

You might struggle with a motor task (like playing a tough sequence on a piano), but after sleeping, be able to play it flawlessly. Sleep seems to transfer motor memories to subconscious habits.

- Motor memory is associated with stage 2 NREM, which is concentrated in the last cycle of sleep.

(Shortform note: While Walker writes that motor memory is connected to NREM sleep, the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard School suggests that [motor learning is linked to REM sleep](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory). They acknowledge that researchers have varying views when it comes to the sleep stages linked to memory, but that the overall evidence suggests that sleep in general is important for memory and learning.)

### Potential Forms of Sleep Therapy

Now that we understand the impact of sleep on the brain, Walker urges us to imagine how we can **apply this knowledge to the creation of useful therapies**:

- Modifying sleep to selectively control what to remember from the day—like remembering content for an upcoming test and a happy moment, while decreasing memories of unpleasant moments. (This might lead to the side effect of having a distorted memory of life.)
- Using sleep to delete traumatic memories (for PTSD) or train away bad motor habits (like substance abuse).
- Finding ways to augment the natural abilities of sleep, like with electrode stimulation of the brain, pulsing sound in sync with brain waves, or rocking the bed rhythmically.

> **The Sleep Research Revolution**
> 
> While conducting tests in a lab enables researchers to more closely observe patients and reattach wires that fall off during sleep, [new at-home methods of sleep tracking](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-future-of-sleep-studies) are helping researchers more extensively study sleep orders and come up with more useful therapies. Some of the new approaches to testing are:
> 
> - **Portable devices**—much like lab equipment, these can monitor sleep brain wave activity, leg movements, and breathing.
>     
> - **Wearable tech**—research published in 2021 suggests that [consumer sleep trackers may be just as accurate as comprehensive lab tests](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/44/5/zsaa291/6055610#247740733).
>     
> - **Telehealth**—video calls allow doctors to reach more patients who may not have access to medical centers.
