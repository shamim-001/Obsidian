## 1-Page Summary

Elon Musk is simultaneously one of the most controversial figures of the modern age and one who’s done more than almost anyone else to push technology into the future. Spurred by childhood dreams of saving the planet while propelling humans into space, Musk made commercial spaceflight into a viable business, brought electric vehicles into public awareness, and promoted a path to make artificial intelligence a benefit to the human race.

However, the way that Musk presents himself in the business world and the public sphere has led many to see him as irresponsibly disruptive toward society. His path to success has alienated colleagues and competitors, his intense drive and lack of empathy have routinely stirred up chaos in the companies he owns, and his need to control every aspect of his businesses has silenced productive criticism that may have benefitted Musk’s overall goals.

For his [book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Elon-Musk/Walter-Isaacson/9781982181284) on Musk, Walter Isaacson followed Musk for two years, gaining intimate access to his thoughts and activities and interviewing those closest to him, including people now cut off from Musk’s circle. Musk exerted no editorial control, letting Isaacson draw his own conclusions.

Isaacson is a renowned biographer known for his works on [Albert Einstein](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Einstein/Walter-Isaacson/9780743264747), [Benjamin Franklin](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Benjamin-Franklin/Walter-Isaacson/9780743258074), and [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/leonardo-da-vinci/1-page-summary). In 2011, Isaacson published a definitive biography of Apple co-founder [Steve Jobs](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/steve-jobs/1-page-summary), for which he was similarly given access to Jobs’s life, family, friends, and colleagues.

In this guide, we’ll follow Musk’s journey from a traumatic South African childhood, through his early successes to his establishment of SpaceX and Tesla, the companies that would define him. We’ll look at Musk’s complicated family life and his takeover of Twitter, an act that’s shaken Musk’s public perception. Because Musk is such a divisive public figure, we’ll compare the views of his supporters and detractors on the various milestones he’s achieved over the years. This guide will give context to Musk’s innovations and business decisions and will look at how Musk’s constant push for innovation is affecting the trajectory of technological progress.

### Elon Musk’s Beginnings

The insightful yet combative nature that would come to define Musk later in life had its roots in his early upbringing. Musk’s childhood was shaped by early trauma, compounded by the difficulties caused by his neurodivergence. Isaacson describes the abuse Musk suffered at home and at school, and how he was only able to escape through his love of science fiction and computing, the latter of which would enable him to start a new life on the other side of the world.

Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, on June 28, 1971. Because he was unusually smart as a child, he started school a year early, perhaps to his disadvantage. **Musk had trouble making friends, in part due to his difficulty interpreting emotions and personal cues**—a trait which Musk would later identify as a symptom of Asperger's syndrome. Musk was regularly beaten at school, and at home, both he and his mother endured Musk’s father’s relentless verbal assaults. Musk’s parents divorced when he was eight years old, and because his mother worked long hours to support them, he and his siblings had to fend for themselves.

(Shortform note: [Asperger’s syndrome is a form of autism](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/Asperger-Syndrome) in which a person has difficulty mastering interpersonal skills, but language skills and intellectual development are otherwise unimpaired. Asperger’s is diagnosed mainly by observation—people living with Asperger’s might exhibit traits such as [obsessive behaviors, hypersensitivity, and difficulty understanding other people’s perspectives.](https://www.healthline.com/health/aspergers-symptoms-in-adults) Children with Asperger’s and other autism spectrum disorders are [especially vulnerable to bullying and abuse](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-015-0052-y), such as what Musk experienced growing up.)

Isaacson writes that at the age of 10, Musk decided to live with his father, despite the nonstop verbal abuse, out of guilt that his father was living alone. Musk endured this period of his life by retreating into science fiction books and comics, in which **he met characters out to save the world and started to dream about going to the stars.** At this time, Musk also discovered video games and computers. He taught himself to write programs so well that by the age of 13, he was designing his own video games and selling them to computer magazines.

(Shortform note: As an innovator inspired by science fiction, Musk is in good company. The father of rocketry himself, [Robert Goddard](https://www.famousscientists.org/robert-goddard/), became fascinated by the possibility of flight beyond the Earth after reading H.G. Wells’s _[The War of the Worlds](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/188559/the-war-of-the-worlds-by-h-g-wells/)_. [Simon Lake](https://jerseyshorescene.com/the-jules-verne-of-atlantic-highlands-the-simon-lake-story/), a pioneer in the design of submarines, incorporated real-world elements that were first described by Jules Verne in _[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/531358/twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-sea-by-jules-verne-translated-with-an-introduction-and-notes-by-david-coward/9780141394930/)_. More recently, Microsoft founder [Bill Gates](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates) has credited [the novels of the author Robert A. Heinlein](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/bill-gates-says-this-sci-fi-book-helped-him-develop-mindset-for-success-experts-say-hes-onto-something.html) for broadening his ability to envision the future.)

As Musk neared his high school graduation, he knew he had to leave his abusive father behind. Isaacson suggests that, unfortunately, **Musk had developed some of his father’s traits**—such as swinging rapidly toward dark moods with little warning and expressing his anger in vicious verbal tirades. Still, he wanted to spare himself and the rest of his family from his father’s influence. He moved to Canada with $4,000, where he worked on farms and lumber yards as he paved the way for his mother and siblings to join him. Once they were all reunited in Toronto, Musk took a job as a Microsoft intern and began his college career.

(Shortform note: Many people who experience childhood abuse find themselves taking on traits of their abusers. In psychology, this is known as [repetition compulsion](https://www.simplypsychology.org/repetition-compulsion.html), in which someone tries to control their past trauma by replaying and mastering it in the present. Usually, [this process is completely unconscious](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-repetition-compulsion-7253403) and can only be addressed through therapy and self-work. In Musk’s case, Isaacson stops short of making a psychological evaluation, but he points out the telling similarities between Musk’s behavior and his father’s.)

#### Early Ventures

From the start, Musk intuited a path that would align his skills and interests with his later successes in life. Musk used a solid educational grounding to create not one, but two successful software companies that propelled him to millionaire status. Isaacson shows that by combining software engineering with business in college, Musk was able to get an early edge in two growing markets—online business databases and Internet banking.

Though he considered pursuing a Ph.D. after graduating college in 1995, **Musk worried he might miss the rising Internet boom and decided to go into business instead.** With $40,000 in financial support from his parents, Musk and his brother Kimbal designed an online business database that they merged with mapping software, creating the first program where users could look up a business’s address and see it displayed on a map. Dubbed “Zip2,” their company consisted of a small team of engineers whom Musk drove hard to work long hours, setting an example by also driving himself nearly to the point of exhaustion. In 1999, Compaq bought Zip2 for $300 million, planting the seed of Musk’s next fortune.

(Shortform note: 1995 was a bumper year for the internet and the computer industry. [The global market for personal computers had grown by 25%](https://www.tech-insider.org/statistics/research/1996/0126.html), with Compaq and IBM in the lead. Microsoft released its landmark [Windows 95](https://www.theverge.com/21398999/windows-95-anniversary-release-date-history) operating system, as well as the first version of [Internet Explorer](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2972589/up-down-out-20-years-microsoft-internet-explorer.html). Intel released its groundbreaking [Pentium Pro](https://www.pctechguide.com/pentium-cpus/pentium-pro) central processing unit, and several new scripting languages made their debut, such as [Java](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/j/java.htm), [Javascript](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/j/javascript.htm), PHP, and [MySQL](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mysql.htm). That year also saw the debut of the first fully computer-generated motion picture, _[Toy Story](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/toy-story-turns-20-changed-animated-films-forever/story?id=35281890)_. Musk was correct to sense that the time was ripe for computer innovation.)

Musk’s next goal was to start an online bank, which he launched as X.com. Musk and his rival, PayPal, flourished because the auction site eBay created the need for online payment platforms. However, X.com and PayPal both suffered during the dot-com crash, and Isaacson writes that to avoid a war of attrition, **Musk and PayPal’s founders merged their companies into one bank** that was X.com at its core, operating under the PayPal name. However, because Musk ignored warnings that PayPal was being used as a platform for financial fraud, the board removed Musk from his position of power. He still benefited to the tune of $250 million when eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002.

(Shortform note: Before Musk’s involvement, PayPal grew out of a product created by the Internet startup [Confinity](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confinity), which was designed to facilitate payments on [Palm Pilots](https://history-computer.com/palm-pilot-guide/), the precursor to modern-day smartphones. In _[The Founders](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Founders/Jimmy-Soni/9781501197260)_, Jimmy Soni explains that Confinity originated the concepts of [digital wallets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-wallet.asp) and [email money transfers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/email-money-transfer.asp), while Musk’s X.com focused on building a more general-purpose online bank. Before the merger of X.com and PayPal, both of the companies were aware of the other’s developments, and each believed their competitor was pursuing the wrong business strategy.)

#### Rules for Business

By the time Musk started his next business venture, his management style was firmly established. Isaacson asserts that Musk’s leadership mindset is entirely mission-focused with an emphasis on challenging workers rather than nurturing them in any way. Central to Musk’s process is the creation of high-intensity work environments, a system for streamlining everything a business does or creates, and an outright denial that human empathy has any place in the pursuit of innovation.

##### High-Intensity Work Environments

According to Isaacson, Musk thrives on intensity and chaos and sees bringing that energy to his companies as a net positive. He achieves this by setting very tight and seemingly arbitrary deadlines for project objectives. To meet these deadlines, **Musk encourages his teams to experiment, fail, and try something new,** without being afraid to jury-rig solutions to problems. Musk’s deadlines force his managers and engineers to think creatively and simplify projects down to their basic principles, but they can also be demoralizing in the extreme, especially when team members believe Musk asks for things that are impossible to achieve.

(Shortform note: In technology journalist Ashlee Vance’s 2015 biography _[Elon Musk](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk)_, he paints [Musk’s insistence on astonishingly tight deadlines](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-6#ambitious-deadlines) in a more positive light. Vance suggests that Musk’s employees understood that Musk’s most extreme deadline expectations had to be taken with a grain of salt. Vance highlights the positive outcomes of Musk’s ambitious scheduling, such as beating industry expectations if not living up to Musk’s own. Isaacson acknowledges this as well while drawing attention to the mental and physical toll of round-the-clock work.)

##### Streamlined Systems

Isaacson writes that **Musk’s workers often find that his high-speed deadlines are in fact achievable** via Musk’s method for streamlining systems. First, he demands that engineers and designers question each supposedly necessary mandate, such as what materials to use, how many lines of code a program needs, or even what safety measures should be followed. Next, Musk demands that any process or component of a system that can be deleted _should_ be. Once that’s been done, whatever’s left in a product or procedure should be optimized and accelerated.

(Shortform note: In _[Think Like a Rocket Scientist](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist)_, Ozan Varol takes Musk’s concepts of first-principles thinking and simplification and shows how to apply them to any type of business. To do so, you must [focus on subtracting whatever you can](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist#how-you-can-use-first-principles-thinking) from a system to increase efficiency while viewing your business as a competitor would, looking for weaknesses to be eliminated. You will often have to [reframe your basic problems](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist#how-you-can-reframe-a-problem), forgetting about the process entirely and determining what your actual goal is. Musk did this with PayPal when he realized that his goal was to _simplify_ online banking rather than duplicate traditional banking in the digital world.)

##### No Room for Empathy

The third component of Musk’s management style, and the one that does perhaps the most to alienate the people Musk works with, is that **Musk rejects human empathy as a valuable leadership skill.** Musk has often said that managers who are friends with their workers can’t be good managers—they won’t be able to challenge their workers and give harsh, if necessary, feedback and criticism. Isaacson says that in Musk’s view, there’s a binary choice between protecting colleagues’ feelings and achieving goals. Musk himself has never been shy about confronting others in hard, unfiltered language, and while he’s used that to his advantage, those closest to him claim it’s a facet of Musk’s personality that he learned from his abusive father.

(Shortform note: Musk isn’t alone in suggesting that empathy is overrated. In _[Against Empathy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/against-empathy)_, Paul Bloom argues that decisions based on empathy are often counterproductive. While empathy increases our short-term kindness, [it leads to making irrational choices](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/against-empathy#whats-wrong-with-empathy) with negative long-term consequences. In place of empathy, Bloom recommends practicing [reasoned compassion](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/against-empathy#what-is-reasoned-compassion), which he describes as an intellectual focus on other people’s overall welfare rather than their feelings in the moment. Given Musk’s stated concern for the well-being of the whole human race, it might be argued that he’s attempting reasoned compassion on a grand scale.)

#### Musk’s Troubled Nature

Isaacson writes that Musk’s intense drive and sweeping accomplishments come at a personal cost, a fact that Musk freely owns up to. The psychological challenges Musk struggles with don’t determine every aspect of his personality, but they strongly color how other people view him. Among these are his difficulties understanding other people’s emotions and his need for constant, intense stimulation as a means to ward off depression.

Isaacson hints that **Musk’s emotional development was stunted in childhood as a result of his father’s abuse**—to survive, Musk learned to shut down his feelings. This, in combination with his Asperger’s traits, taught Musk to interpret emotions differently than those without such harsh backgrounds. Musk’s closest friends describe his childlike joy when he’s enthused by new ideas or projects, as well as his deep well of feeling for his family and loved ones. However, Musk has trouble with the feelings of others, which he approaches from an intellectual standpoint. Isaacson writes that when Musk feels threatened, he still shuts his feelings down in a heartbeat while using shows of anger to deflect the threat.

(Shortform note: In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence)_, psychologist Daniel Goleman identifies [repressing emotions](https://shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2#repressing-emotions) as a defense strategy that, while not necessarily negative, can blind a person to the very real physiological side effects of the emotions they’re hiding from themselves. Success guru Tony Robbins rejects the idea that repressing negative feelings is ever helpful. In _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within)_, he argues that [emotional avoidance and denial are disempowering](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-8#reject-disempowering-ways-of-addressing-your-emotions) because even negative feelings have value as warning signs that something needs to be addressed.)

While shadowing Musk to research his biography, Isaacson noted that Musk doesn’t handle success very well. Instead of relishing his achievements, **Musk craves crisis and thrives when he’s fighting for survival.** This need is so strong that Musk will manufacture crises for his companies, such as setting arbitrary demonstration deadlines for products that aren’t yet finished. As mentioned before, these deadlines generate bursts of productivity, but they also force Musk and his teams to work round-the-clock shifts in a state of constant panic. Often, these periods of intense concentration are the only way for Musk to stay engaged and motivated without sliding into depression or risk-seeking behavior.

(Shortform note: In _[The Body Keeps the Score](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score)_, psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk offers a possible explanation for the behavior of people like Musk who seem to deliberately instigate their psychological stress. Van der Kolk explains that the body and mind can become addicted to any kind of stimulation, including the endorphins released in stressful situations. In this sense, [some trauma survivors can become addicted to trauma itself](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/chapter-2#addiction-to-trauma). For these people, periods of calm cause physical withdrawal from the endorphins they depend on, so they’ll actively seek out stressful situations to relieve the discomfort of their anxiety and boredom.)

> **Musk’s Positive Side**
> 
> [Musk’s 2015 biography](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk) by Vance placed more of an emphasis on Musk’s strengths. These begin with [his future-oriented mindset](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-5#future-oriented-motivations), which puts the long-term good of the human race above any personal considerations. Following that is Musk’s conviction that [businesses and industries can always be improved](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-5#desire-to-improve) and that it’s his duty as a person of influence to encourage and facilitate that improvement. Musk backs up this conviction with [a lifelong love of learning](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-5#desire-to-learn), improving his understanding of new, complex subjects on a regular basis.
> 
> What Isaacson portrays as Musk’s compulsive need for chaos, Vance depicts as [an ability to persevere](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-5#ability-to-handle-stress) through times of great stress, as well as [a high tolerance for risk](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-5#high-risk-tolerance) that gives him an edge over his business competitors. Vance says that what also makes Musk stand out is the way [he integrates technical details with big-picture thinking](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/elon-musk/part-5#ability-to-situate-the-details-within-the-big-picture) so that while he’s solving individual problems he can keep his focus on his overall motivation.

### Musk the Pioneer

Despite his demons, or perhaps because of them as Isaacson sometimes suggests, Musk has arguably pushed technology forward more than any other living person in the modern age. In a way, **Musk has made it his personal mission to bring human civilization to other worlds** via his company SpaceX, while weaning us away from fossil fuels by developing electric vehicles through Tesla.

Musk fears the consequences of humanity being trapped on a single, fragile planet that’s endangered by the technology that we’ve used to advance ourselves. Isaacson writes that he’s also motivated by a sense of grandiosity—after all, who else will save the world if he doesn’t? In this context, Musk is driven by his mission. How to make that mission profitable is something he considers after the fact. Nevertheless, both SpaceX and Tesla have proven to be great financial successes, and while either business would be a crowning achievement, Musk believes in both so strongly that he can’t devote his attention to only one. As a technologist out to save the world, Musk served in part as the inspiration for the movie version of the superhero Iron Man.

(Shortform note: The [Iron Man](https://www.marvel.com/characters/iron-man-tony-stark) character that Isaacson says Musk inspired first appeared in 1963’s _[Tales of Suspense #39](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/11280/tales_of_suspense_1959_39)_, written by Stan Lee’s brother [Larry Lieber](https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lieber_larry.htm), who modeled him after the famed inventor and industrialist [Howard Hughes](https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/howard-hughes). When developing the first _[Iron Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/)_ motion picture, screenwriter Mark Fergus says the writers drew on several sources such as [Musk, Donald Trump, and Steve Jobs](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/tony-stark-elon-musk-donald-trump-steve-jobs.html).)

#### SpaceX

After selling PayPal in 2002, Musk turned his thoughts to putting his fortune to the eventual goal of colonizing Mars, with the thought that humanity’s chances of survival would be increased by spreading out to other worlds. He founded SpaceX to take the incremental steps needed for that goal—building a reusable launch vehicle, proving that commercial spaceflight is a viable business, and designing rockets large enough to carry heavy payloads beyond the Earth’s orbit.

**Musk’s first step was to build a reusable rocket that could launch satellites into orbit.** Right away, Musk set unfeasible deadlines for a rocket launch in 2003 and an unmanned Mars mission in 2010. Neither of those goals were met, but in 2003, Musk presented his Falcon 1 rocket design and SpaceX was awarded its first government contract. Isaacson recounts how that wasn’t enough for Musk, who knew that most space industry companies received noncompetitive no-bid contracts for their work regardless of how well they performed. Musk sued NASA, arguing that no-bid contracts stifled innovation while propping up failing aerospace companies. Musk’s suit opened the door to competitive private bidding for space projects.

(Shortform note: While Isaacson presents Musk’s reasons for fighting against government no-bid contracts, there are [several arguments in their favor](https://www.visioneerit.com/blog/no-bid-contracts-government-contracting-process). The process itself for soliciting bids can be time- and cost-prohibitive, especially in [emergency situations](https://www.fema.gov/grants/procurement/understand-exception) when a government agency may need a service quickly, such as in response to a natural disaster. In other cases, an agency may need a specific set of skills or subject expertise that [only one contractor can provide](https://www.american.edu/finance/procurement-contracts/sole-source-purchasing.cfm). Because [no-bid contracts have often been wastefully exploited](https://www.bettergov.org/2015/11/15/no-bid-contracts-invite-government-corruption/), there has been [substantial pushback against them](https://www.bidnet.com/resources/business-insights/how-no-bid-contracts-are-interfering-with-competitive-bidding-en.jsp) such as the lawsuit Musk brought against NASA.)

After that, the history of the Falcon 1 was a string of lessons learned from mistakes. The first three Falcon 1 flights exploded shortly after liftoff, but **each failure gave SpaceX more information about what worked and what didn’t in their design.** The fourth SpaceX flight was successful, proving that a private company could send payloads into space at a fraction of the cost and manpower employed by enormous government contractors. In 2008, SpaceX won a $1.6 billion contract to ferry cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS).

(Shortform note: Learning from failure is an essential strategy taught by management and self-help experts alike. In _[Dare to Lead](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, Brené Brown insists that [positive ways to turn failure into an advantage](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-4) should be included as part of an organization’s onboarding process. Likewise, in _[The Art of Learning](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-learning)_, chess master Josh Waitzkin suggests that you should [actively seek out opportunities to fail](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-learning/chapter-5#actively-seek-out-challenges) because the faster you make mistakes, the faster your knowledge will grow. While those mistakes come at a low cost when learning to master a skill like playing chess, it takes courage to risk mistakes when launching spacecraft that cost millions of dollars.)

Fulfilling SpaceX’s new contract required a much bigger rocket. The result was the Falcon 9 and its recoverable capsule, the Dragon. The Falcon 9’s inaugural flight set the record for the largest rocket ever safely landed—those designed by rival aerospace companies were made to burn up in the atmosphere after use. Making the Falcon 9 successful required last-minute fixes and patches that would have caused NASA weeks of delays. Isaacson says that **Musk’s tolerance for risk enabled SpaceX to solve problems quickly** in ways that cumbersome organizations couldn’t. The Falcon 9’s success culminated in its 2020 flight of two astronauts to the ISS, the first manned American launch since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.

(Shortform note: Reusable rockets weren’t invented by SpaceX. The [Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs)](https://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/system/system_SRB_prt.htm) used to launch the Space Shuttle into orbit were designed to gently splash down at sea, where they could be recovered and reused in future missions. Likewise, a rocket that could land vertically under its own power formed the basis of the [Apollo Lunar Module](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059C). However, no components of the Apollo mission were reusable. [SpaceX’s Falcon 9](https://youtu.be/rHvUpZR72bw?si=L_f8HOaX_wCuHR2l) and [Blue Origin’s New Shepard](https://youtu.be/81kZDxL_N_o?si=B_J17HzwzdmiR4i5) were the first reusable launch vehicles that could both take off and land successfully.)

##### Starlink

Funding an aerospace company isn’t easy. To do so, Musk launched Starlink, a satellite-based internet service provider. Though he never meant for Starlink to be used for military purposes, in 2022 Musk donated thousands of Starlink terminals to help restore Ukraine’s communication network during the Russian invasion. This he did for humanitarian reasons, and Starlink proved vital to holding back Russia’s advance, but Isaacson writes that Musk deactivated part of Ukraine’s Starlink access when they planned to use it in a counterattack. Musk feared that an escalation in the war might trigger a Russian nuclear response and decided that Starlink should only be used for purely defensive operations.

(Shortform note: Days before the publication of this book, [Isaacson posted a retraction and clarification](https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2023/09/12/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-ukraine/) about his reportage on Musk disabling Starlink. According to Musk, Starlink had long been disabled in the region where Ukraine planned their offensive. Instead of deactivating Starlink at the time of the attack, a move that would have actively supported the Russian position, Musk simply denied Ukraine’s request to extend Starlink coverage into the contested region. [Isaacson accepted Musk’s correction of his timeline](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/12/elon-musk-biographer-admits-suggestion-spacex-head-blocked-ukraine-drone-attack-was-wrong) and acknowledged that Musk’s policy of restricting Starlink’s use to defense had been established before the planned attack.)

#### Tesla

Musk’s other dream besides leaving the Earth was _saving_ the Earth by ending society’s fossil fuel addiction. Musk believed an energy-efficient future was just as vital to humanity’s survival as space exploration, and he chose to make an impact by bringing electric cars into the mainstream. Isaacson details how Musk entered the automotive industry with Tesla, based all of its production inside the US, and pushed its technology in the direction of fully automated, self-driving cars.

In 2003, Musk began meeting with entrepreneurs in the electric car industry. Tesla was the brainchild of Martin Eberhard, who’d licensed an electric motor for a high-end sports car that he didn’t have the funding to build. Musk provided the money and took charge of many of the car’s technical details. Tesla came together with Musk as the board chair and Eberhard as CEO, but clashes began because **Eberhard and Musk each thought of himself as Tesla’s founder.** Isaacson writes that Musk was incensed when the press painted him as a “mere investor,” so he took it upon himself to proselytize the company’s mission—disrupting the gas-guzzling automobile market with affordable, high-quality electric vehicles.

(Shortform note: Decades after the clashes between Eberhard and Musk that Isaacson describes, Musk continues to face allegations that [he unfairly stole Tesla from Eberhard](https://www.fastcompany.com/90563199/did-elon-musk-steal-tesla-heres-why-the-ceo-is-rebutting-long-time-allegations-on-twitter). [Eberhard still owns a portion of the company](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/11/10/tesla-had-5-founders-only-two-got-really-rich/?sh=38c02066f462), but in interviews, he declines to reveal the size of his share in the business. When asked what he would have done differently from Musk, Eberhard says that [he would have pushed back against Tesla’s investment in solar power](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cofounder-martin-eberhard-interview-history-elon-musk-ev-market-2023-2) and that he would have worked to promote a friendlier working environment for employees.)

Musk took a more active role in managing Tesla’s production process, and he found that the company’s supply chain was a disaster. Its parts were manufactured all over the world, and then shipped from country to country as the car’s components were assembled piecemeal. When Musk calculated how much each car cost, factoring in worldwide shipping and assembly, he realized that Tesla would quickly go bankrupt. He quickly moved to have Eberhard fired and eventually took over as CEO himself. Isaacson says that **Musk’s primary focus was to centralize production** so he could control the process from start to finish, going so far as to sleep on the factory floor as he stayed day and night to solve production problems.

(Shortform note: While centralizing production under one roof can bring down supply chain costs and increase efficiency, as Isaacson suggests, it also comes with several hazards. Such integration requires [high up-front costs](https://www.inboundlogistics.com/articles/vertical-integration/), such as building new facilities or buying controlling shares in suppliers. The added weight of taking on all production can also [hamper a company’s ability to pivot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) if the nature of its industry rapidly changes.)

To bring about the future he imagined, Musk didn’t only want an electric car, but one that could drive itself. In tune with Musk’s habit of setting aggressive deadlines, Isaacson writes that for over a decade, **Musk has publicly declared that self-driving cars are a year or two away**, and advances in machine learning are close to fulfilling Musk’s ambitions. Instead of driving based on preprogrammed “rules of the road,” new systems learn by observing the best human drivers and how they react in all situations. As a result, in 2023, Musk rode a self-driving Tesla on a 30-minute trip around Palo Alto without ever touching the steering wheel or brakes.

(Shortform note: The Autopilot test that Isaacson describes didn’t take place until 2023, but Tesla had already [promoted a video in 2016](https://www.tesla.com/videos/full-self-driving-hardware-all-tesla-cars) suggesting that full self-driving capability was already available on all Tesla models. In 2023, a Tesla engineer testified in court that [the video had been staged](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/) using a preprogrammed route rather than making use of a Tesla’s actual capabilities. Apple co-founder [Steve Wozniak expressed outrage](https://fortune.com/2023/02/09/steve-wozniak-says-dishonest-elon-musk-cheated-tesla-buyers/) at Tesla’s misrepresentation of its self-driving features, criticizing the low quality of his personal Tesla’s autopilot system.)

### Musk’s Family Life

The energy, passion, and frustration Musk expresses in the boardroom and on the factory floor are matched by the tumult he also brings into his private relationships. Isaacson says that just as in business, **Musk seeks out intensity and chaos in his personal life.** Musk has had turbulent relationships with the author Justine Musk (_née_ Wilson), the actress Talulah Riley, and the musician Grimes, and has fathered 11 children whom he dotes on save for one from whom he’s publicly estranged.

Justine and Musk were acquainted in college, but they reconnected and married around the time of the sale of Musk’s first business. According to Isaacson, **Justine was attracted to Musk because he was passionate about solving problems** more than making money. She enjoyed fighting as much as Musk did, but after the sudden death of their infant son, Musk shut down all displays of emotion and berated Justine when she expressed hers. The couple had five more children through in vitro fertilization, but over time Justine felt that Musk used their fights as a substitute for personal connection, and she filed for divorce in 2008.

(Shortform note: Isaacson barely mentions Justine Musk’s career. [Justine is the author of several novels](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30036.Justine_Musk), including [the BloodAngel fantasy series](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/AMQ/bloodangel) and the young adult thriller _[Uninvited](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Uninvited/Justine-Musk/9781416538271)_. [Writing about their divorce in 2010](https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5380/millionaire-starter-wife/), Justine said that Musk’s attitude toward marriage had been influenced by his upbringing in male-dominated South African culture. She described herself as a “[trophy wife](https://www.marriage.com/advice/relationship/trophy-wife/)” who’d sacrificed much of her self-image to live up to Musk’s expectations.)

Shortly after his first marriage ended, Musk met the actress Talulah Riley, and within two weeks they were engaged—though they wouldn’t marry for two years. Isaacson says that Musk was self-aware enough to let Riley know that life with him would be hard. Nevertheless, while their marriage lasted, it was one of the few stable things in Musk’s life. Despite Musk’s often unfeeling exterior, Riley says that inside, **Musk feels things quite strongly and retains a boyish excitement** for the things that bring him joy. Their first marriage lasted until 2012, but they quickly remarried and stayed together until 2015, when they split for good.

(Shortform note: Though Isaacson suggests that Riley put her acting career on hold during the time she was married to Musk, [she played many supporting roles in those years](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1506908/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_1_nm_7_q_talulah), including appearances in _[Thor: The Dark World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981115/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_10_act)_ and the television series _[Doctor Who](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0)_. During this time, she also directed and starred in the movie _[Scottish Mussel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4194108/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_1_dr)_, which was nominated for the Audience Award at the [Edinburgh International Film Festival](https://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/edinburgh-international-film-festival). Since her split with Musk, Riley has landed recurring roles in the TV series _[Westworld](https://www.hbo.com/westworld)_ and _[Pistol](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/pistol)_.)

During 2018, which was a rough year for all of Musk’s business ventures, he met the musician Claire Boucher, known as Grimes. The two shared many common interests, and like Musk, Grimes was attracted to chaotic relationships. However, Isaacson writes that **Grimes possesses a streak of kindness that had long been missing from Musk’s life.** Though the two ended their romantic relationship in 2021, they remain involved with each other as friends and co-parents of their children.

(Shortform note: Though Isaacson doesn’t cover her career in detail, Grimes is perhaps the most professionally accomplished among those with whom Musk has been romantically involved. Her 2012 album _[Visions](https://4ad.com/releases/574)_ received acclaim from _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/arts/music/reviews-of-albums-from-grimes-galactic-and-tyga.html)_ and _[NME](https://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews-grimes-12833-320007)_, while also winning the [Juno Award](https://junoawards.ca/) for Best Electronic Album of the Year. Grimes is known for speaking openly about her struggles with [mental health and social anxiety](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/05/grimes-hospitalized-panic-attack-after-saturday-night-live-appearance-elon-musk). In 2022, she announced on Twitter that like Musk, [she’s on the autism spectrum](https://www.newsweek.com/grimes-tweet-people-hate-correct-type-neurodivergent-statement-1742350) and has difficulty reading other people’s emotions.)

#### Musk’s Children

In total, as of this book’s publication, **Musk has fathered 11 children**—six with his first wife, Justine Musk, three with his partner Grimes, and two with business executive Shivon Zilis for whom he served as a genetic donor. His first child, Nevada, died in 2002 from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. His first child with Grimes—a boy named X—was born in 2020 and was almost inseparable from Musk during the time that Isaacson spent with him. According to Isaacson, Musk is very vocal about the need to keep population numbers up to preserve human consciousness in the face of growing artificial intelligence, and that he’s just doing his part to maintain the species.

(Shortform note: Isaacson doesn’t present the counterpoint to Musk’s fears—namely, that population growth is unsustainable. In _[Thank You for Being Late](https://shortform.com/app/book/thank-you-for-being-late)_, Thomas Friedman explains that population growth is a driver of climate change and poverty, as more and more people consume even more resources while [the global economy can’t provide enough jobs](https://shortform.com/app/book/thank-you-for-being-late/chapter-6#population-and-globalization) to keep up with demand. In _[Apocalypse Never](https://shortform.com/app/book/apocalypse-never/1-page-summary)_, Michael Shellenberger offers the optimistic prospect that advances in energy technology, such as those that Musk is working on, will allow populations to [urbanize, stabilize, and hopefully recede](https://shortform.com/app/book/apocalypse-never/1-page-summary#reasons-for-optimism) to a healthy, sustainable level. Whether Musk would see that as a good thing is questionable, given how Isaacson frames Musk’s population fears.)

The only child with whom Musk’s relationship is strained is his transgender daughter Jenna, who Isaacson reports has disavowed her connection with Musk due to her perception of his anti-transgender views and because of her anti-capitalist political beliefs.

(Shortform note: Jenna legally changed [her name and gender](https://www.eonline.com/news/1335630/judge-approves-name-change-for-elon-musks-daughter-vivian-jenna-wilson) in June 2022, when she also took her mother’s maiden name Wilson to further disassociate herself from her father. Jenna’s mother, Justine, [came out in support of her daughter’s transition](https://www.yahoo.com/video/elon-musk-ex-wife-very-161546020.html) on Twitter shortly after. According to the Pew Research Center, [a majority of Americans support transgender rights](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/), especially those in younger demographics. Likewise, polls show that [Millennials and Jenna’s cohort, Gen Z](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/), hold [increasingly negative views of capitalism](https://fortune.com/2021/03/29/capitalism-gen-z-poll-views-capitalist-society/), more so than those of Musk's generation and before.)

### The Twitter Saga

As Jenna became vocal about her left-leaning political views, the 2020s marked an apparent shift in Musk’s politics toward a strongly conservative stance. An avid user of the Twitter platform, Musk began to feel that its policies for banning users and promoting certain messages were skewed by a heavy liberal bias. To resolve this, Musk decided to get involved himself, first by influencing Twitter by investing, and then later by buying it outright. Isaacson describes Musk’s early interactions with Twitter’s board of directors, his rapid decision to purchase the entire platform, and his last-minute cold feet about closing the deal.

Isaacson theorizes that part of the reason behind Musk’s interest in Twitter was the unrivaled success that Tesla and SpaceX were experiencing in 2022. The calm and ease that came with success didn’t sit well with Musk’s disposition, but instead of igniting new projects at those companies, he dove into Twitter instead, encouraged by a circle of libertarian friends who, like Musk, wished to see Twitter’s content policies relaxed. Based on the size of his investment in the company, **Musk approached Twitter about membership on the board** but quickly realized that sharing power that way wouldn’t allow him to make sweeping changes.

(Shortform note: The idea that Twitter even _had_ content moderation for Musk to worry about may come as a surprise to some users. The platform became notorious for its role in [spreading misinformation during the 2016 US presidential election](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-twitter-affected-2016-presidential-election). The same period saw [a rise in tweets employing hate speech](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/10/21/massive-rise-in-hate-speech-twitter-during-presidential-election-donald-trump/92486210/) targeted at a plethora of groups. A review by Amnesty International charged that Twitter was failing in its civic duty to curtail [abusive and violent content targeting women](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/03/online-violence-against-women-chapter-1-1/). In 2017, [Twitter enacted new policies](https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0207/Twitter-takes-further-steps-to-crack-down-on-hate-speech) to block hate speech and ban abusers who hid behind multiple accounts. By Isaacson’s timeline, this may have been the pendulum swing that Musk believed went too far in the other direction.)

Isaacson writes that rather than joining the board, Musk offered to purchase Twitter for $44 billion. Musk believed he could make Twitter profitable by offering validated user accounts for a monthly fee, as well as turning Twitter into a financial platform on which artists and creators could get paid for work they posted. Musk also wanted to democratize Twitter by removing all censorship and making its algorithm for content promotion open source and available to the general public. Beyond that, **Twitter was something Musk loved as an arena for dramatic, unfiltered expression.**

(Shortform note: Twitter’s creator Jack Dorsey originally envisioned the platform as [a tool to send brief texts to groups of people](https://penningtoncreative.com/the-origins-of-twitter/). Usage exploded from 20,000 tweets per day in 2006 to 500 million per day in 2017. Some features, such as hashtags and the @ symbol, grew out of the linguistic shorthand that developed as [people tried to squeeze their thoughts into 140 characters per tweet](https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-twitter-3288854). Politics entered the Twitter fray with Barack Obama’s US presidential campaign and [the rise of the Tea Party in 2008](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/twitter-politics-last-decade/475131/). Twitter also became a journalistic tool as users tweeted breaking news about the [2010-11 Arab Spring uprisings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/25/twitter-facebook-uprisings-arab-libya) and the [2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/14/7539649/ferguson-protests-twitter). As an outlet for the power and drama of speech, Twitter’s appeal to Musk can’t be doubted.)

However, after Musk had time to think about the deal, he started to feel that he was overpaying. Isaacson says that one crucial point was the number of fake Twitter accounts, which Musk believed the company severely undercounted. Musk had analysts comb through Twitter’s data to find out how many of the accounts were real, and when they couldn’t make a determination, Musk tried to back out or at least drop the price. Twitter sued to make Musk follow through on his agreement, but Musk got in the last twist of the knife by closing the deal a day sooner than expected and firing Twitter’s executives before they could use their stock options. **Musk believed they’d misrepresented Twitter’s value,** and therefore his actions were justified.

(Shortform note: Musk may not have had the last laugh on the issue of his Twitter takeover. The law firm of [Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz](https://www.wlrk.com/), who were employed by Twitter’s board to force Musk to complete his Twitter purchase, [charged the company a $90 million success fee](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/technology/twitter-sues-wachtell-lipton.html). Twitter’s board approved the transfer of funds 10 minutes before Musk finalized his purchase. In July 2023, [Musk sued the firm](https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-musk-sues-wachtell-law-firm-recoup-fees-twitter-buyout-2023-07-07/) to recoup that fee, but as of this writing, the case has yet to be heard in court. Meanwhile, Twitter (now X Corp) faces [a multitude of lawsuits from former employees](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/x-corp-agrees-to-try-to-settle-lawsuits-over-mass-layoffs-1) charging that the company owes them severance pay.)

#### The Challenges of Twitter

By taking over Twitter, Musk triggered a seismic shift in the social media landscape. The culture at Twitter and Musk’s leadership style were diametrically opposed in almost every way, resulting in a clash of ideals that upended the character of the social media platform. Musk disrupted the Twitter status quo by laying off the majority of its staff, reframing its content and account-holder policies, and reinstating many banned accounts that had been blocked for violating Twitter’s previous rules.

Isaacson explains that prior to Musk’s takeover, **Twitter’s culture emphasized inclusivity, caring for employees, and psychological safety in the workplace**—all of which went against Musk’s crisis-based, aggressive management style. The first thing Musk did was to have teams from SpaceX and Tesla evaluate Twitter’s software engineering department with an eye toward reducing the company’s size. Layoffs targeted inefficient coders, staff who were potentially disloyal to Musk, and anyone who wasn’t willing to maintain the frantic pace of work that Musk preferred. The latter round of layoffs was self-driven—Musk explained his workplace expectations and gave Twitter’s remaining staff the option to “opt in” or take severance.

> **Different Takes on Workplace Culture**
> 
> Management literature is divided on how much psychological care and concern a business should devote to its workforce. In _[No Rules Rules](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules)_, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings backs up Musk’s position that [employees should be treated as team members, not family](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-2#think-of-the-company-as-a-team-not-a-family), and that workers who are merely “good enough” [should be fired to make room for even stronger replacements](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-2#fire-any-employee-you-wouldnt-fight-to-keep). In Isaacson’s biography of [Steve Jobs](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/steve-jobs/1-page-summary), he describes how the former Apple CEO managed from a similar mindset—he only wanted to employ top-tier talent who could [keep up with his demanding nature](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/steve-jobs/1-page-summary#a-tyrannical-taskmaster) while offering pushback on himself and their colleagues.
> 
> The other side of the debate argues that security and empathy are needed for workers to safely give feedback and collaborate. In _[The Unicorn Project](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-unicorn-project/1-page-summary)_, Gene Kim describes workplaces such as the ones Musk creates as [toxic and detrimental to productivity](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-unicorn-project/1-page-summary#symptoms-of-a-toxic-workplace), while establishing [psychological safety—the freedom to admit mistakes and fix them without blame or humiliation](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-unicorn-project/1-page-summary#candor-and-safety)—as an essential cornerstone for collaboration and creativity. In _[Dare to Lead](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, Brené Brown agrees, stating that [building trust and connection with your workers](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead#skill-3-build-trust-and-connection) prevents defensive responses to criticism and encourages workers to grow and do better. Musk’s path is quicker—fire those who don’t perform and replace them as needed.

Musk’s next move was to halt what he saw as Twitter’s censorship of free speech, but Isaacson says that Musk quickly learned that “free speech” isn’t a simple issue. **As soon as Musk took over the platform, it was swarmed by online bots posting offensive content,** testing the limits of what Musk would allow. Musk had his staff shut down the attack while he leaned into creating paid, verified accounts as a means to filter out bad-faith actors, but that strategy also proved problematic—users could pay for a verified account, then change their account after the fact to impersonate another person or business.

(Shortform note: Musk himself became the target of many of these impersonation attempts. Isaacson mentions one impersonation that was merely a parody stunt, but many other fake Twitter accounts used Musk’s name to trick unsuspecting victims into [fraudulent cryptocurrency deals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/01/31/25-elon-musk-impersonator-scams-on-social-media-people-actually-fell-for/?sh=5c8fc6ba57f8). One Florida school principal was almost bilked out of [$100,000 in school funds](https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-principal-sent-100k-in-school-funds-to-elon-musk-impersonator/) by one of these Musk impersonators. A second round of impersonators [flooded Twitter in April 2023](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twitter-impersonators-elon-musk-verification-system-1234720892/) when Musk introduced [Twitter Blue (now X Premium)](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-x/x-premium), replacing the previous identity verification system. Some impersonators are merely pranksters, while others are actively malicious.)

#### Addressing Twitter Censorship

Musk still believed that Twitter’s old content policies had gone too far in response to such misuse of the site. To prove it, he invited journalists to pore through Twitter’s moderation policies and records. They discovered that not only did Twitter have a left-leaning bias, **it had worked with the FBI to decide what information should be blocked or hidden.** In some cases, Isaacson reports that this had gone beyond barring hate speech and misinformation to the outright silencing of voices that didn’t agree with mainstream thought.

(Shortform note: Twitter’s cooperation with the FBI is hardly an isolated incident, though the concern that many people voice is that of [unwarranted government access to their personal information](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/) rather than censorship. A report made public in 2023 confirms that [government agencies frequently buy users’ personal data](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-us-government-purchases-your-user-data-heres-what-it-does-with-it/) from the same third-party dealers that collect information for marketing purposes. Nor is Twitter alone in being asked to block content. Google receives so many government requests to remove content from its apps that [it publicly reports how many it receives](https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/overview?hl=en) and its policies for dealing with them case-by-case.)

Isaacson writes that in November 2022, Musk began reinstating accounts—both conservative and progressive—that had been banned by Twitter’s previous management, including that of former president Donald Trump, of whom Musk wasn’t a personal fan. An unintended consequence was that **advertisers started leaving the platform,** cutting into Twitter’s bottom line. Musk didn’t help matters by making impulsive tweets of his own, some of which amplified conspiracy theories or targeted former Twitter employees. The damage done to Twitter’s brand started to spread to Musk’s other companies and his reputation. Musk realized that dealing with Twitter was negatively impacting his mental state, and buyer’s remorse began to set in.

(Shortform note: Branding experts argue that Musk’s most damaging act is [his decision to change the name “Twitter” to X](https://fortune.com/2023/07/24/elon-musk-twitter-x-brand-value/). The move can’t be completely surprising, as Isaacson repeatedly calls attention to Musk’s fondness for the letter X—as in X.com, SpaceX, and his son named X. However, Twitter’s branding and associated words such as “tweet” have entered the common vocabulary. Sometimes brands change their names [to distance themselves from negative associations](https://mashable.com/article/companies-that-changed-their-names); however, if customers’ emotional attachment to a brand isn’t taken into account before the change, [the business can suffer as a result](https://www.theuptownagency.com/blog/watch-for-these-mistakes-when-renaming-your-brand).)

In Isaacson’s first-hand analysis of the Twitter takeover and its fallout, he suggests that **Musk’s fundamental mistake was treating Twitter as a technology platform, rather than a network for leveraging emotion.** Musk tried to rebuild Twitter the way he’d design a rocket or a car—by cutting pieces off, seeing if it explodes, putting it back together, and trying again. This strategy worked well in Musk’s previous endeavors, but not so much in the realm of social media. And yet, though many outside observers have repeatedly predicted Twitter’s collapse, as of the time of this book’s publication, that still hadn’t come to pass.

(Shortform note: While Isaacson may be correct that Twitter’s collapse isn’t imminent, the Pew Research Center [tracked several trends during Musk’s retooling of the company](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/26/8-facts-about-americans-and-twitter-as-it-rebrands-to-x/), such as the fact that 60% of US users planned to take a hiatus from the platform and questioned if they’d ever return. Those who remained Twitter users under Musk tended to use it less frequently than before, and partisan divides between users have grown wider. [Quarterly revenue continued to drop](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics/) through the first half of 2023, but despite the loss of advertisers, total revenue remained higher than it was before 2020.)

### Musk and the Future

Despite the distractions and disruptions at Twitter, Musk’s other companies have still been working hard to constantly push technology forward. Isaacson insists that Musk still views bringing about a positive future for humanity as his primary mission in life. To achieve this, his teams have been developing computer chips to enhance human brains, AI-driven robots to perform manual labor, and a spacecraft capable of taking astronauts to Mars.

In 2012, Musk began to ponder the threats represented by unchecked artificial intelligence. To keep AI aligned with human values and progress, and so it can enhance us rather than replace us, Musk created **Neuralink, a company to research and design computer chips to directly connect the human mind to computers.** Isaacson explains that the immediate benefits would be to help people with neurological disorders regain control of their bodies. However, Neuralink’s end goal is still to create a seamless mind-machine interface so that AI can add to human consciousness. As of 2023, thanks to its progress—such as [enabling a macaque to play video games with its mind](https://youtu.be/2rXrGH52aoM?feature=shared)—Neuralink’s technology has been approved for human trials.

(Shortform note: As impressive as Neuralink’s accomplishments are, they aren’t the only bioscience company working toward a brain-computer interface (BCI). In 2021, [Synchron Inc.](https://fortune.com/2021/07/28/synchron-elon-musk-neuralink-fda-trial-brain-computer-implant/) received FDA approval to perform human trials ahead of Neuralink reaching that goal. In 2022, [Blackrock Neurotech](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/record-set-for-implantable-brain-tech-blackrock-neurotech-celebrates-30-000-patient-days-301576994.html) reported that it had reached 30,000 days of having its devices implanted in patients to research their effectiveness. In 2023, [Precision Neuroscience](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/23/precision-a-neuralink-competitor-conducts-its-first-clinical-study.html) began using BCIs to map the human brain itself. Though Musk is an active participant in this race, as Isaacson makes clear, many other businesses and researchers are working to push the technology further.)

Another AI-based project Musk’s taken on is **the Optimus project to build human-friendly robots capable of performing any physical task.** Isaacson says that Musk sees such robots as a benefit to society—they could remove the drudgery of human labor, allowing people to spend their time pursuing educational and creative projects. By giving AI a physical presence, rather than disembodied language programs such as ChatGPT, Musk believes humanoid robots are a necessary step in the next level of AI development, one that will align AI’s interests with those of the physical world.

(Shortform note: As with Neuralink and brain-computer interfaces, Tesla’s Optimus is far from the only humanoid robot currently in development. Another is [Hanson Robotics’ Sophia](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/), which incorporates advances in language learning and emotional perception as well as articulated motion. [Boston Dynamics’ Atlas](https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/), while deviating from a strictly human form, displays a wide range of athletic abilities and agile motion in real-world environments. Though the early Optimus models that Isaacson describes weren’t as jaw-dropping as some of Musk’s competitors, demonstrations in 2023 show [great improvement in Optimus’s design](https://electrek.co/2023/05/16/tesla-bot-sideshow-new-footage-robots/), especially in terms of hand articulation and environmental perception.)

Lastly, Musk has never wanted to be stuck in only one world. Colonizing Mars has always been his highest goal, and the next step in achieving that ambition is **SpaceX’s Starship rocket, a reusable spacecraft larger than the Saturn V** that launched Apollo to the moon. The first Starship test flight took place in April 2023. The rocket cleared the launchpad and almost made it into space before an engine problem aborted the mission. Isaacson makes it clear that Musk and his staff didn’t see this as a failure but as a learning success. Data taken from this initial flight will be used to improve future Starship rockets, perhaps one day sending astronauts back to the moon and beyond.

(Shortform note: Isaacson illustrates that when it comes to testing new projects, Musk prefers to try and try again as quickly as his teams can prepare them. In the case of Starship, Musk’s major hurdles are regulatory instead of technical. After the first Starship test exploded, [SpaceX faced a milieu of routine evaluations](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-is-frustrated-about-a-major-spacex-roadblock-) by a variety of government agencies. The [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/) wrapped up its findings in September 2023, but the [US Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/) had not yet completed its review of the Starship launch’s environmental impact. Musk, of course, [voiced impatience on Twitter](https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/09/34776307/elon-musk-expresses-frustration-at-fish-and-wildlife-agency-induced-delay-in-starships-second-flight), since the Starship itself was ready to fly.)
