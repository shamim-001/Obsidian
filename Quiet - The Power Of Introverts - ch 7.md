## Chapter 7: Introverts and Extroverts Think Differently

**Introverts and extroverts think differently when it comes to making decisions, taking chances, recognizing and heeding warning signs, and solving complex problems.** Both have strengths that they can leverage to their benefit when they also mitigate the downsides of their way of thinking. Companies can benefit by making sure both kinds of thinkers are involved in key decisions.

### Reward Sensitivity

**A big difference between introverts and extroverts is how they view potential rewards** or benefits they might get from taking certain actions. Extroverts are often reward-sensitive, meaning they’re highly motivated to seek rewards, whether job promotions, gambling winnings, or goals such as money, social status, sex, and influence. In contrast, introverts are better at controlling their emotional response to potential rewards and delaying gratification.

Some researchers believe the tendency to seek rewards—from alpha status to money and sex—is a key characteristic of extroversion. Reward-seeking drives them to be more ambitious and social than introverts. **Extroverts get a “high” (pleasure and excitement) from pursuing and reaching their goals**. This takes the form of a jolt of dopamine (a chemical response) in the brain. Introverts don’t experience a high as easily.

Reward-seeking gives extroverts the courage to take chances and take on challenges, but it can also get out of hand. **An obsession with a big payoff can drive people to act irrationally and ignore clear warning signs.**

Janice Dorn, a “financial psychiatrist” who studies reward sensitivity, has seen the downside first hand. She recalled counseling an investor who kept buying and selling stock despite continuously losing money in 2008 (the year of the big market crash)—to the point of ultimately losing $700,000. He was so excited at the possibility of ultimately making a lot of money that he ignored the warning signs to slow down and actually escalated his buying when he shouldn’t have. According to Dorn, the extroverted traders she works with are more likely to get carried away by potential rewards, while introverts heed warning signals and are more able to control their emotions.

Similarly, company directors buying other companies can get so caught up in beating other bidders that they pay more than the target company is worth. Behavioral economists call this phenomenon “deal fever,” and its result the “winner’s curse” (the consequences of a bad deal). The AOL-Time Warner merger in 2000 is an example: Time Warner’s directors approved the deal despite signs that AOL’s stock was overvalued. Time Warner shareholders lost $200 billion.

Further, University of Wisconsin researchers found that when reward-sensitive extroverts run into roadblocks or warning signs while pursuing a goal, they press ahead even harder without considering the warning signs. In contrast, introverts stop, question themselves, and become more vigilant. **Because they stop and reassess, introverts are better able to learn from setbacks or mistakes and to foresee future problems.**

### Risk-Taking

Along with making risky investment decisions, extroverts are prone to downplay or ignore danger in other areas. For instance, extroverts are more likely than introverts to:

- Be killed while driving
- Be hospitalized due to injury
- Smoke
- Have risky sex
- Be unfaithful
- Participate in high-risk sports
- Be overconfident

All this suggests that **when it comes to making group decisions, extroverts would do well to listen to introverts, especially when introverts see problems ahead.**

Genetics may be a factor in risk-taking. One researcher found that extremely reward-sensitive extroverts who have one variant of a dopamine-regulating gene are more likely to take financial risks. However, introverts who have another gene variant—of a serotonin-regulating gene—take 28% less financial risk. These introverts outperformed others at complicated gambling games. In another study, of traders at a large investment bank, the best performers were even-keeled introverts.

**Introverts also may be better at delaying gratification**—in studies where participants had a choice of an immediate reward or a larger one later, extroverts tended to go for the immediate reward, while introverts waited for the larger one.

Looking back at the 2008 financial crisis where financial institutions made risky loans, some analysts contended a major cause was that aggressive risk-takers dominated the decision-making process and pushed more cautious people aside.

A similar thing happened at Enron in 2001. The energy company’s business culture favored risk-taking extroverts, who ostracized introverts and pushed for reckless business deals that ultimately led to bankruptcy.

### Learning and Thinking

Besides helping them avoid financial disaster, **introverts’ caution and reflectiveness can help them excel academically and solve complex problems**.

In elementary school, extroverts get better grades, but in high school and college, introverts surpass them. In college, introversion is a more accurate predictor of academic performance than is cognitive ability. A disproportionate share of graduate degrees and Phi Beta Kappa keys are earned by introverts. They surpass extroverts on a critical thinking assessment often used by businesses in hiring. Introverts are good at what psychologists call “insightful problem-solving.”

Here are some ways the two groups differ in processing information:

- **Extroverts do better than introverts under time pressure and when required to multitask**. Also, they handle information overload better.
- Extroverts allocate most of their cognitive capacity to the present task, while introverts use up capacity by monitoring how the task is going.
- **Extroverts opt for speed over accuracy in problem-solving**. They make increasing numbers of mistakes in the process and may quit if the problem gets too frustrating. In contrast, introverts think before they act, digest information thoroughly, stay on task longer, give up less easily, and work more accurately. One researcher gave people printed mazes: introverts tended to solve more mazes correctly, but they also spent a greater percentage of time studying the mazes before starting on them.
- **Introverts do better on tasks requiring persistence**, including social tasks. For instance, in one study, introverts did better at cold-calling in telemarketing.
- Extroverts are more likely to focus on what’s happening around them. Introverts tend to sit around wondering about things and making plans.

### Finding a Balance

Both introvert and extrovert approaches to problem-solving have value—however, our society seems to overvalue action and the highs that come from reward-seeking. Businesses would benefit by incorporating both approaches in key decisions. As an individual, **you can also benefit from understanding where you fall on the reward-sensitivity spectrum and moderating your emotional responses.**

If you’re highly motivated by the highs of reward-seeking, you can use it to accomplish big things and inspire others. Focus your energy on high-impact activities rather than quick highs. Also, learn to stop and consider warning signs and learn from mistakes. Recognize when you’re fixating on rewards and susceptible to acting recklessly; associate with people who can slow you down when necessary.

If you’re an introvert, be true to your nature: use your persistence, absorption, imperviousness to rewards, and analytical ability to solve complex problems and avoid pitfalls. Don’t let others rush your deliberations. Stay independent, trust your instincts, and apply your ideas as effectively as you can.

For example, be like investor and introvert Warren Buffet, who made billions for himself and shareholders by using persistence, careful analysis, and attention to warning signs. Buffet is known for stepping back to reflect when others are charging heedlessly ahead. He contends that having an even temperament and ability to control impulses that drive others is more important to successful investing than having above-average intelligence.
