## Habit 6: Collaborate to Create Possibilities

**Habit Description:**

- Collaborating with another person (what Covey calls creating “synergy”) enables you to achieve more than either of you could alone.

### Why It Matters

According to Covey, collaboration creates an outcome that’s greater than the sum of its parts, as in 1+1 = 3 or more (for example, the harmony of two people singing together is entirely different than any sound either could produce alone). This is possible because **the relationship itself adds value by creating the opportunity for collaboration.**

Covey says you can’t create this kind of collaborative magic without the interdependent habits we’ve already discussed:

- Habit 4—Seeking mutually beneficial solutions is a collaborative practice.
- Habit 5—Empathic listening enables you to understand others’ contributions in order to incorporate and build on them.

These habits foster trust and goodwill, which enables both parties to communicate openly, and that makes collaboration possible. The table below shows the important relationship between trust, communication, and outcomes.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Trust Level**|**Communication**|**Outcome**|
|Low|- Suspicious<br>- Defensive|- A vicious cycle develops: This kind of communication further erodes trust, which makes people even more protective and defensive.<br>- People adopt Win/Lose or Lose/Win frameworks.|
|Moderate|- Polite and respectful<br>- Genuine<br>- Avoids opening up enough to risk confrontations|- People understand each other’s positions intellectually, but they don’t assess their own paradigms or open their minds to new possibilities.<br>- Often leads to compromise, a lesser version of a mutually beneficial solution.|
|High|- Open<br>- Vulnerable|- People feel comfortable openly sharing their perspectives because they trust that others will try to understand and build on their ideas.<br>- People seek mutually beneficial solutions.|

> **Oxytocin Improves Trust and** **Collaboration**
> 
> Subsequent research has revealed that the connection between empathy, trust, and [collaboration is not only behavioral—it's neurological](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust). Paul J. Zak, who studies neuroeconomics (the intersection of neuroscience and economics), found that
> 
> - When people feel trusted, their brains release higher levels of oxytocin.
>     
> - When people have higher levels of oxytocin, they become more _trustworthy_ and _trusting_.
>     
> - When people are in an environment with high levels of mutual trust, they become more productive and collaborative, as well as happier, more energetic, and more loyal to the organization.
>     
> 
> In other words, Covey’s and Zak’s equations are similar but distinct:
> 
> - Covey: Trust improves communication, which improves collaboration.
>     
> - Zak: Trust raises oxytocin, which improves trust (that again raises oxytocin in a virtuous cycle), which improves collaboration.
>     

**You need a high level of trust and candid communication to produce creative, collaborative results.** The collaboration then further strengthens the relationship, which adds to the high levels of trust and encourages even more communication and cooperation.

> **Example: Trust and Candor Are Key to Netflix’s Innovative Success**
> 
> In _[No Rules Rules](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/606529/no-rules-rules-by-reed-hastings-and-erin-meyer/)_, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings wrote that fostering trust and candor enabled the business to adapt and grow from a mail-order DVD service to an international media company that produces original, award-winning content for millions of subscribers.
> 
> Hastings wanted his employees to feel trusted and empowered to improve innovation; he believed that when people don’t feel the freedom to make their own decisions, it hinders their creativity. Hastings built trust by:
> 
> - [Eliminating vacation policies](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-3) and travel and expense policies, instructing employees to use their best judgment, and providing some parameters to prevent abuse
>     
> - Empowering all employees to [make decisions and own the consequences](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-6), rather than seeking approval from managers
>     
> 
> With that trust in place, Hastings insisted that employees provide frequent, candid, constructive feedback to create accountability and ensure that teams recognize mistakes, learn, and improve as quickly as possible. To do this, he:
> 
> - Taught employees how to constructively [give and receive feedback](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-2)
>     
> - Instructed staff to [give feedback to managers](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-2) and executives—not just peers and subordinates
>     
> - Formalized feedback with [written and face-to-face 360-degree reviews](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-8) (also called multi-rater feedback or multi-source feedback or assessment), in which each employee receives comments on their performance from everyone on their team and anyone else in the company who wants to chime in
>     
> - [Increased organizational transparency](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-5) by making sensitive data (like profit and loss statements) available to all employees
>     
> 
> Hastings also describes a third key element to Netflix’s success: [Hiring only top-tier talent](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/part-1-chapter-1) and [firing them when their performance drops](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/part-3-chapter-7) (but sending them off with a generous severance). Hastings asserts that, without a top-quality staff of dedicated employees, high levels of trust and candor don’t work. This echoes Covey’s premise that you need to develop the previous habits—which arguably make you a top-quality _individual_—in order to effectively collaborate.

### How To

Before you can effectively collaborate with others, Covey says you need to develop “internal synergy,” which we’ll call balance. **Life can be logical as well as emotional, and to be effective, you need to be both analytical and intuitive.**

> **Integrate Reason and Emotion to Access Your Wise Mind**
> 
> Covey references the common belief that some people rely more heavily on their emotion-oriented right brain, and others on their logic-oriented left brain. While the concept of right- and [left-brain dominance has since been debunked](https://www.britannica.com/story/are-there-really-right-brained-and-left-brained-people), the point that we must balance reason and intuition is a valid one.
> 
> Dialectical Behavior Therapy aims to help patients achieve this balance by tapping into their [“wise mind,” where reason is integrated with feelings](https://youtu.be/xgQentdy_1Y). (This is related to [Aristotle’s concept of practical wisdom](https://kstatelibraries.pressbooks.pub/EDCI702/chapter/module-2-practical-wisdom/), which balances knowledge, context, morals, and values.) Try these practices to tap into your wise mind:
> 
> - Be present; try not to think of anything but what you’re experiencing right now.
>     
> - Notice your thoughts without judging or engaging with them.
>     
> - Notice your physical sensations.
>     
> - Notice your emotions without judging or trying to change them.
>     
> - Recognize that positive and negative can coexist (for instance, you may be excited about a new job but also sad about certain aspects of leaving your old job).
>     
> - Recognize that strong emotions can distort your view of what’s true and false; try to identify objective facts.
>     

#### Shortform Strategy: Increase Trust and Improve Collaboration on Your Team

Covey’s discussion suggests that, as an individual, one of the best ways to promote successful collaboration is to be prepared with the right elements—a collaborative mindset, empathic listening skills, high levels of trust, clear communication, and internal synergy. However, as a leader, you have more authority to control the setting and gather the right ingredients for collaborative success.

Neuroeconomist Paul J. Zak identified [eight strategies that managers can use to build a high-trust culture](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust) in order to boost collaboration (and oxytocin).

1. **Assign tasks that are challenging but attainable.** This creates a moderate stress that pushes the team to rise to the challenge.
2. **Be transparent** about the organization’s direction, goals, and strategies. A lack of transparency leads to stress among team members, which decreases oxytocin and hinders collaboration.
3. **Be vulnerable.** Beyond being transparent about the company, a leader should be transparent about their own questions and shortcomings. When team members see their leader asking for help, it raises their oxytocin levels and fosters trust.
4. **Encourage relationship-building.** Team members who care about each other perform better for fear of disappointing their teammates.
5. **Help people grow personally and professionally.** Personal growth improves work performance by increasing engagement and retention.
6. **Allow people to choose _what_ they work on.** When workers pick the projects they care about, they’re likely to be more engaged and productive.
7. **Allow people to choose _how_ they work.** As long as they know the parameters, this trust gives workers the freedom to innovate.
8. **Celebrate successes publicly and promptly.** Publicly recognize team members who meet goals, and do it as soon as possible.

### Going Deeper

Like much of Covey’s advice, collaboration as a concept is fairly simple, but it’s not easy to do. You and the other party may have to overcome substantial challenges to effectively collaborate—but the results are worth the effort.

- **Some people especially struggle to adopt a collaborative mindset.** Many people become defensive and distrustful when asked to collaborate, so they seldom have successful experiences, which reinforces their skepticism. Often, they see glimpses of collaboration only under extreme circumstances, like an emergency, which can make them believe that collaboration is a rare phenomenon. (Shortform note: [Reasons people resist collaboration](https://hbr.org/2011/12/eight-dangers-of-collaboration) include: They don’t like ambiguity or not having the answer, fluid roles bother them, they’d rather act than talk, they experience information overload, they fear conflict, and they don’t want more work.)
- **People’s differences are invaluable for collaboration.** Differences of opinion make collaboration _difficult_, but they are essential to the nature of collaboration: Someone who has the same view and opinion as you adds nothing to your knowledge and perspective, but someone with a different view gives you the opportunity to expand your perspective and come up with solutions that would never have occurred to you. As we’ve discussed, you need to be aware of your own perspectives in order to recognize that your view of the world is not objective and that other’s views could help you develop a more well-rounded understanding. (Shortform note: [Collaboration is different from teamwork](https://www.theatrefolk.com/blog/collaboration-vs-teamwork-whats-the-difference/). Collaborators are equal partners collectively creating an end product, so differences contribute to the best result. However, in teamwork, a leader simply directs members to do individual jobs moving the group toward a goal.)
- If you can topple the hurdles, the payoff is exponential because **collaboration is contagious.** If one person is courageous enough to trust those around them and communicate openly, it makes others feel safe to be open and authentic, too. This can create an upward cycle of creativity and collaboration; for instance, in a group brainstorming session, it takes just one out-of-the-box suggestion to lead the group to even more innovative ideas.

> **How to Foster Non-Threatening Collaboration**
> 
> While many business leaders understand the value of collaboration, they often overlook the fact that employees may feel threatened by the prospect of sharing information, resources, and responsibilities—they could feel like they’re working themselves out of a job.
> 
> Lisa B. Kwan, a senior researcher and executive leadership coach at Harvard, calls this the [“collaboration blind spot,” and it can have negative ripple effects](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-collaboration-blind-spot). First, a team’s threatened, defensive reaction causes them to hoard information and sabotage the collaboration. Then, the failed collaboration creates a negative expectation that taints future collaborative efforts before they even start. Just as Covey writes that collaboration is contagious, it appears that _counter_-collaboration is, too.
> 
> To avoid this fate, all the teams involved must feel secure in their position and value at the company. (Kwan focuses on teams, but, presumably, this also applies to individual employees.) Kwan identified three elements that create a team’s sense of security, and she outlines how to protect each one when initiating a collaboration.
> 
> - **Identity**—An individual’s or team’s identity gives them a sense of who they are within the company. Leaders should reflect on how each group identifies itself (including its unique traits and sources of pride) and how the collaboration could threaten that self-image. Then, leaders can publicly recognize key aspects of the teams’ identities and emphasize how important they are to the company.
>     
> - **Legitimacy**—This is _why_ the individual or team exists and is valued within the company. Again, leaders should reflect on the groups’ main sources of value and how asking them to share information and responsibilities in the collaboration might make them feel that their legitimacy is in jeopardy—and, again, the solution is to recognize and reinforce that they are valued. Teams might especially need this affirmation in the early phases of collaboration.
>     
> - **Control**—This is an individual’s or team’s autonomy to do their work. Leaders should identify each team’s areas of expertise—including technologies, processes, and outcomes—and consider whether and how these are impacted by the collaboration. If the initiative calls for either group to share or give up control in any of these areas, leaders can maintain their sense of security by giving them greater control over some other area of responsibility, even if it’s unrelated to the collaborative project.
