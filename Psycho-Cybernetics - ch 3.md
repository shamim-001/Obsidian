## Chapter 3: Positive Self-Image Versus Negative Self-Image

The previous two chapters make it clear that you need to make sure you have a positive self-image so that you can consistently achieve success and happiness in your life. Maltz argues that **you need to examine what type of self-image you have so you can figure out if it’s working with you or against you**.

But how can you figure out what kind of self-image you have if it lives in your subconscious mind? Maltz argues that **your self-image—and the way it directs your subconscious to act—is expressed through your personality**. Further, he claims that your habitual personality traits tend to fall into one of two personality types that define how you approach your life experiences: positive personality and negative personality.

(Shortform note: Maltz argues that your habitual personality traits define whether you have a positive or negative self-image. However, there are many people who suffer from a poor self-image but _believe_, and appear to others as if, they have positive personality traits: They use these positive traits to conceal their poor self-image. For example, consider people who give too much of themselves to others (their time, money, or effort). On the surface, [these people come across as altruistic](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-nourishment/201903/the-dark-side-being-giver) and, therefore, positive. However, in some cases, **this positive trait serves to cover up feelings of low self-worth**—if they're motivated by the need to please others to win affection, or if they're motivated by the need to avoid displeasing others.)

### What Personality Type Are You?

Let’s examine the personality traits Maltz attributes to positive and negative personality types so you can figure out what type of self-image you have:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Positive Personality (Good Self-Image)**|**Negative Personality (Bad Self-Image)**|
|**You’re goal-oriented:** You have a clear idea of what makes you happy and focus on what you want. You keep moving forward and are driven by a desire to become more and achieve more.|**You’re overly sensitive to setbacks:** You let errors and minor failures define your emotional state. You act like a victim of life.|
|**You’re open:** You communicate well with others because you’re willing to think about their perspectives and why they think and feel the way that they do. You’re willing to admit your mistakes and errors.|**You’re accusatory:** Your frustration leads to aggression that you misdirect towards yourself or others. You lash out because you’re not resolving your problems.|
|**You’re willing to take risks:** You’re willing to take risks and face new challenges. You confront your problems.|**You’re insecure:** You never feel good enough. You compare yourself to others or hold an ideal version of yourself that you fail to live up to. You always feel like you should be better than you are.|
|**You’re empathetic:** You treat others with kindness and respect because you recognize that every individual is valuable and important. You understand and appreciate that everyone has unique needs and abilities.|**You’re guarded:** You feel alienated from yourself and others. You’ve lost touch with what makes you happy and you’re afraid of exposing your real self to others.|
|**You value yourself:** You have a healthy sense of self-worth and self-respect. This is reflected in the way you interact with others.|**You’re afraid:** You’re fearful of making mistakes and hold yourself back from making decisions or taking responsible steps to move forward.|
|**You’re confident:** You remember and focus on your past successes and happy moments. This positive focus allows you to approach life with confidence.|**You’re resentful:** You blame others for treating you unfairly. You expect others to make you feel happy and you feel like a victim when they don’t. You perceive injustice and allow this to control your emotional state—self-pity.|
|**You’re happy with yourself:** You accept yourself as you are and express yourself authentically. You’re aware of your strengths and weaknesses and you know that you can decide to change if you choose to.|**You’re apathetic:** You’re unable to enjoy life no matter how much you achieve. Your achievements don’t feel worthwhile because you can’t see the value in them.|

> **Why People Are Prone to Failure**
> 
> People don’t _choose_ to develop negative personality traits—they’ve simply developed the habit of dwelling more on the bad experiences in their lives. Psychologists refer to this tendency as the [Negativity Bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618).
> 
> Research shows that you’re hardwired to notice and dwell on negative events. Further, negative events have a greater impact on you than positive ones—your emotional responses are stronger for negative events than they are for positive ones. In other words, negative events _feel more important_ to you than positive ones. Subsequently, negative events create a strong and vivid impression in your long-term memory, and they influence the decisions you make.
> 
> Consequently, you’re more likely to notice, react to, and remember:
> 
> - **Criticism more than praise**: This leads you to focus _only_ on feedback that reinforces your feelings of insecurity. As a result, you may feel like a victim (you blame others for criticizing you) and withdraw into self-pity, or you may end up lashing out at others in an attempt to release your feelings of resentment.
>     
> - **Sad memories more than happy memories**: The habitual focus on sad events from the past makes it difficult to find reasons to be happy in the present moment. This can lead to apathy and depression.
>     
> - **Bad news more than good news**: This tendency trains your mind to perceive situations as unjust or unfair, and often leaves you feeling fearful of taking action and moving forward in your life.
>     
> - **Your mistakes more than your successes**: The more you focus on your mistakes, the more difficult you find it to accept yourself as you are—you reinforce the false belief that _you should be better than you are_.
>     
> - **Negative traits in others more than their positive traits**: The tendency to focus on flaws in others makes it difficult for you to trust others and show them who you really are—_if you can’t accept them as they are, how can they accept you_? The more you restrict your self-expression, the more isolated you feel.
>     
> 
> It’s possible that **evolution hard-wired this bias into us to keep us safe from danger**: In order to ensure survival, our ancestors had to pay more attention to the dangers and risks in their environment. However, even if it is a case of hardwiring, you can make the conscious decision to bypass this tendency, evolve your thinking, and adopt a more positive approach to life.

> **How to Predict Success**
> 
> While Maltz believes that personality traits like being confident and empathetic determine your success, some experts believe that [the following characteristics and habits are better indicators of whether you’re more likely to achieve success in life](https://www.eruptingmind.com/personality-characteristics-of-success-and-failure/):
> 
> - You choose to be proactive instead of lazy.
>     
> - You seek long-term satisfaction instead of instant gratification.
>     
> - You focus on interests that create value instead of indulging in meaningless activities and distractions.
>     
> - You keep learning and growing instead of allowing your knowledge and skills to stagnate.
>     
> - You embrace challenges and expect to succeed instead of feeling inadequate and expecting to fail.
>     

### How You Develop a Positive or Negative Personality

Now we’ll discuss how you can develop a positive or a negative personality—according to Maltz, the key is whether or not you feel comfortable enough to express yourself authentically.

#### Authentic Self-Expression

You’re more likely to develop a positive personality if you focus on your unique capabilities, and think about what fulfills and satisfies you _more_ than you think about what other people may or may not think about you—this way, you focus on what brings you happiness (successful feedback) instead of how you’re interpreting the way others respond to you (likely to create negative feedback). In other words, you don’t allow other people’s opinions to inhibit you—this is commonly referred to as authenticity.

(Shortform note: Psychologists agree that you’re more likely to develop positive personality traits if you engage in authentic behaviors. These [psychologists break authenticity down into three components](https://healthypsych.com/the-study-of-authenticity/): how well you know and understand yourself, how well your behavior reflects your true feelings, and how often you change your behavior to meet external expectations.

The more self-aware you are, the more you can understand your motivations and assess whether or not you’re acting authentically.)

Maltz argues that **the more authentic you are, the more successful you feel**—you’re more able to deal effectively and appropriately with your environment, respond to situations spontaneously, express yourself confidently, and choose and reach goals that satisfy you.

Maltz believes that every human being is unique, inherently valuable, and always evolving. You’re not inferior to anyone. You're not superior to anyone. You are simply you, and you are good enough. A unique and successful personality is a sign that you’ve accepted yourself as you are, figured out what brings you genuine satisfaction, and that you proactively pursue experiences that make you feel satisfied.

> **Why Authenticity Makes You Feel More Successful**
> 
> Some psychologists argue that authenticity (the ability to express who you really are) is essential to your overall sense of wellbeing. [Studies reveal that authentic people are generally happier than inauthentic people](https://healthypsych.com/the-study-of-authenticity/). For example they:
> 
> - Experience more positive emotions
>     
> - Have higher self-esteem
>     
> - Have better relationships
>     
> - Feel more satisfied
>     
> - Have lower stress levels
>     

#### Inauthentic Self-Expression

Maltz argues that you’re more likely to develop a negative self-image, which leads to negative personality symptoms, if you constantly seek external validation and try to live up to the expectations of others. In other words, if you’re more conscious of what you _think_ others think about you more than how _you feel about yourself_.

Your environment (social circle, media) is constantly trying to shape you into something that you should be. You’re constantly fed opinions about how wealthy, beautiful, and happy you should be—the underlying message is that you should be, do, or have more to “be good enough.” Negative personalities are sensitive to these opinions and focus more on satisfying the expectations of others than they do on figuring out what they need to feel inner fulfillment—this external focus inhibits them from acting authentically.

(Shortform note: Another way to understand Maltz’s definition of authenticity and inauthenticity is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Some experts believe that [all behavior is driven by the need to fulfill one of two motivation types: intrinsic and extrinsic](https://www.healthline.com/health/intrinsic-motivation#how-it-works). Intrinsic motivation comes from your internal self—you engage in an activity because you find it rewarding (for example, you listen to a particular song because you enjoy it). Extrinsic motivation comes from your environment—you engage in an activity because you receive an external reward for doing it (For example, you perform work you dislike because you get paid for it).)

Maltz argues that inauthentic behavior tends to develop in two ways:

##### 1) Insecurity

When you make a habit of comparing yourself to others, you’re always going to fall short. You’ll always find someone who is better at something than you are—this habit of comparison leads you to develop feelings of insecurity and inferiority which can make you come across as having an “inferiority complex” or a “superiority complex.” Both are manifestations of feeling insecure; however, people with an inferiority complex tend to try and make themselves “invisible,” while people with a superiority complex over-inflate their sense of self-importance to cover up their insecure feelings.

In both cases, your feelings of discomfort make you feel self-conscious and overly sensitive to the feedback you receive—you misinterpret your environment and get caught up in negative feedback loops (remember Bob’s tendency to self-sabotage his attempts to form friendships).

> **Feelings and Tendencies That Lead to Inauthentic Behavior**
> 
> Maltz claims that your insecurities can make you act as if you have either an inferiority complex or a superiority complex. But **how can you know if you’ve developed these inauthentic traits**? Psychologists agree that the more self-aware you are, the more you’ll be able to figure out if you’re showing others your “true self” or if some situations make you feel like you should wear a mask and act the way that “you should” (act inauthentically).
> 
> Developing the ability to honestly assess your feelings and behaviors takes time and patience. However, **[you can detect if you’re prone to acting inauthentically](https://www.bustle.com/p/15-little-signs-you-arent-being-fully-authentic-every-day-73784) by assessing the level of discomfort you feel around others**. Ask yourself if you have the tendency to feel:
> 
> - Embarrassed by things you’ve done or said
>     
> - Awkward and self-conscious in daily interactions
>     
> - Resentful and misunderstood
>     
> - Afraid of what others think of you
>     
> - Rejected and unheard
>     
> 
> These feelings reflect and encourage inauthentic behavior. For example, sometimes shy people come across as loud and overbearing. This is because their discomfort around others leads them to _overact_ to compensate for their shyness. As a result, they find themselves acting inauthentically. This leads them to question whether people _like them for who they are_ or for the act they put on. As a result, they feel more uncomfortable about interacting with others and this encourages more inauthentic behavior.

> **How the Self-Help Industry Promotes Inauthentic Behavior**
> 
> The self-help industry is designed to help you improve yourself but sometimes it makes you feel even more insecure about the problems you’re trying to solve. It does this by focusing on the insecurities you have about yourself and [setting standards for you to live up to](https://bettermarketing.pub/5-ways-personal-development-makes-your-life-worse-not-better-1ad6dbe75a5c). These books and programs target an inadequacy that you’re already feeling (for example, _Psycho-Cybernetics_ targets your “lack of success”), and emphasize **how things should be** (you _should_ be more successful).
> 
> The further you are from the (often unrealistic) ideals expressed in these books and programs (you should be happier, more mindful, more grateful, or richer, and so on), the more inadequate you feel. **The more you try to live up to the expectations and standards that the self-help industry promotes, the more likely you are to find “flaws” within yourself that fuel inauthentic behavior**. For example, if you find yourself faking a positive attitude because these books and programs _make you feel guilty_ for feeling unhappy.

##### 2) Internalized Criticism

If you’ve internalized criticism from others by identifying with their opinions about you, this also serves to inhibit you—you hold back from fully engaging in what you want to experience because _you associate what you want with the negative feedback you’ve internalized_. For example, when you were a child, your mom told you off for talking too much. You internalized this criticism and now associate “talking too much” with getting scolded. You formed this belief many years ago and it now lives in your subconscious mind. Even though you’re not aware of it and may not even remember the original experience with your mother, the belief continues to inhibit your ability to engage with others.

(Shortform note: Maltz’s claim that you’ve internalized feedback from your childhood that continues to impact your personality may lead you to think about how to help children to internalize positive feedback and develop authentic personalities. Bringing up emotionally healthy kids starts with ensuring they know how to process and effectively deal with their environment (the feedback they receive). Based on the latest neuroscience research, _[The Whole-Brain Child](https://www.tinabryson.com/thewholebrainchild)_ explains how children’s brains are wired and offers resources and strategies to promote healthy brain development. )

> **How to Live More Authentically and Develop a Positive Personality**
> 
> Like Maltz, shame and vulnerability expert Brené Brown says that inauthentic behaviors result from feelings of fear and shame. In [The Power of Vulnerability](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-vulnerability), Brown argues that you’re more likely to engage in authentic behavior when you accept that you’re inherently worthy, choose to share your feelings of shame, and allow your vulnerability to be a sign of strength, not weakness. Her suggestions to help you develop a better sense of self-worth and practice authentic living include:
> 
> **Letting go of other people’s expectations**: Be willing to say no to things you don’t want to do without worrying about what others will think of you. For example, if there are certain social situations you get invited to that you find boring, you should feel free to say no without worrying that your friends will feel hurt or upset by your absence.
> 
> **Choosing to focus on self-compassion instead of perfectionism**: Practice mindfulness so that you can catch yourself when you start to berate yourself for making a mistake. Make the conscious effort to be kind to yourself more often, but particularly when you judge yourself for making mistakes or acting inappropriately. For example, if you routinely obsess over conversations you’ve had with others, make an effort to stop this self-analysis and instead do something that enhances your sense of wellbeing, like taking a relaxing bath or reading a good book.
> 
> **Detaching yourself from self-doubt by focusing on what you care about**: Think about what’s important to you and invest your time in creating more fulfilling experiences in your life. The more you focus on what’s satisfying to you, the less attention you’ll give to thoughts that undermine your sense of self-worth.
> 
> **Creating outlets for emotional expression**: Play with different forms of self-expression to express and release any negative emotions you feel. Choose an activity that works with your personality to vent your emotions—choose anything from journaling to taking martial arts lessons.
> 
> **Give up your inhibitions and accept that you’ll never be perfect**: Be aware of when you’re limiting your joy due to your fear of failure or what others think of you. Above all, remember that how you feel about yourself is more important than how others think of you.
