## Arguments 3: Respect the Other’s Opinions

### Principles

- **When attacked for being wrong, people will turtle up and defend their opinion to the death.** They will lose sight of the main point, hoping to find small exceptions when their assertion is true.
    - We form beliefs carelessly, but then develop an irrational passion when anyone threatens to divorce us from them.
- Instead, approach with an open-minded view: “**I may be wrong. I often am. And if I’m wrong, I want to be corrected.** Let’s review the situation.”
    - **Permit yourself** to understand the other person. Your first reaction is to judge. Instead, allow yourself to understand what the other person believes.
- This lowers defenses and opens the bridge to letting your partner consider how she may be wrong.
    - Strategically, this might actually switch the person’s desire from being right to who can be most humble, gracious, and open-minded. No one wants to be outdone, so you change the rules of the game.

### Tactics

- Respect the other person’s opinions. Never say, “you’re wrong.”
- Admit that you might be the one who’s wrong.
- For an angry customer, let them know that your company sometimes makes mistakes and you want to hear more about their situation.
- Remove these dogmatic words from your vocabulary: “Certainly,” “of course,” “undoubtedly.”
    - Instead, say “I imagine,” “It appears to me.”
- Ask people where they feel the problems are. Ask for their opinions on how best to proceed. They may naturally convince themselves of your solution.

### Examples

- An engineering supervisor presented to management her new system of running yarn, highlighting how it was superior and how she had all the answers they needed. It failed - management wasn’t given a way to admit their current system’s failures and they became defensive. In the next session, she changed her approach - she asked what their problems were and for their opinions on how to fix it. This paved the way for her solution.
- A lumber salesman was having his company’s pieces rejected by the buyer’s quality inspector, who was unfamiliar with the white pine under concern. Instead of castigating the inspector for ignoring standard guidelines, the salesman asked questions about why each rejected piece was unsatisfactory, under the guise of figuring out how to deliver better shipments in the future. The inspector’s attitude changed, now being forced to consider the rejection criteria and realizing he didn’t have the full expertise to judge the white pine pieces.
    - The salesman then graciously insisted that while the pieces might be within standard code, if the inspector felt it was unsuitable, they would gladly have it rejected. The inspector began feeling guilty about rejecting any piece, and ultimately realized their company was at fault for not having specified the correct quality grade.
