## Chapter 6: The Fight for My Life

All those times I’d referred patients to physical therapy, I never understood what I was sending them to. Just as you can imagine what losing a parent or child feels like but never understand it until it happens to you, doctors have no real gauge of what the sick go through until we are one of them. Physical therapy was hard, exhausting, and defeating.

I was physically diminished, and at first, just lifting my legs was a struggle. My physical therapist asked what I wanted to accomplish with therapy, and I said the ability to bike and run again, two things I’d regularly and readily enjoyed. Losing those abilities compounded my loss of identity. But each day that I made a tiny step in the direction of progress, I was seeing a possible path back to some semblance of the old me.

After a couple of months, I could sit for thirty-minute intervals more easily. After more time, I was able to socialize with friends again. The first time I got back on my bike, I went six miles. They weren’t the most graceful miles I’d ever ridden and barely accounted for a quarter of the distance I used to cover. But just being on the bike again was a victory.

Still, I didn’t know who I was out in the world. I wasn’t a neurosurgeon. I wasn’t a fit and capable man at the beginning of life. I wasn’t the husband my wife deserved. I had once been someone who could lead and make things happen. Now, I was someone who followed, a recipient rather than agent.

The only time I had any sense of being me was when I was in Emma’s office.

Emma challenged me to concentrate on my values and priorities, rather than my chances. These thoughts included those of being a father, and Lucy and I revisited our thoughts on having a child. We both felt that if human relationality was the foundation of a meaningful life, a child could only enhance that. She was concerned about whether raising a child was the right choice for me for whatever time I had left. I was concerned about whether raising a child alone and simultaneously caring for a sick husband was the right choice for her life.

We reasoned that there was no way to know what the future held for me or us, but living in wait for death was not living at all. With our families’ approval, we decided to live despite death. We decided to live without a clear picture of the future, which was what everyone did. We were going to start a family.

There was irony in the process of creating life. With in vitro fertilization, multiple embryos would be created and implanted. Only those viable would survive. The rest would die. There was no escaping death, even when the goal was to introduce life.

### The Light at the End of the Tunnel

I went in for new scans after six weeks of the Tarceva. My blurry lungs were clear save one tiny spot. My damaged spine appeared to be healing. My cancer was stable. I was grateful and relieved.

My biweekly appointments with Emma were reduced to every six weeks. Our discussions returned to my new possible future. The picture of my life was becoming visible again. My world was settling down and finding its place.

I attended a reunion of former Stanford neurosurgical residents. Everyone there was pushing forward down a successful path full of possibility. Their lives were so similar to the one I’d had. But what was my life going to be now, and how much time did I have to find out?

Emma still hadn’t provided a prognosis, but our talks indicated possibilities. Could I be a neurosurgeon, a scientist, and professor? Should I be those things, or should I stay at home and raise my child, write, soak in life?

Meeting my patients where they were emotionally as a doctor had meant shining a light on the fork in the road and walking with them, hand in hand, to examine the different paths. I’d wanted to know death and provide the intricacies for them to know it, too. Walking now, holding death’s hand, I should understand it better than ever. I should be able to see both paths clearly and know which one to walk down. But I didn’t. It seemed unimaginable that my own mortality should be so confusing and displacing, but that’s exactly how I felt.

Without my medical training to guide me, I returned to my first love for answers: literature. Wanting to be physically involved in the chasm between life and death had pulled me from my pursuit of language to explain it. But now, in wanting to understand what death meant in my life and how it defined who I was meant to be, I returned to language. I sought that same vocabulary I had sought as a younger man.

Literature became my lifeline. My actions had become framed within the confines of how they related to death. But language had a power to supercede that meaning. The relentless uncertainty about what I should be doing ceased one day when the words of Samuel Beckett overshadowed my fears. I started the day suffering, the pain so bad I couldn’t fathom any possibility for action beyond getting up. I thought, “I can’t go on.” Just as quickly, though, Beckett’s words finished the thought, “I’ll go on.” I faced the day, one step at a time, repeating, “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”

Everything became clear in that moment. Although I was dying, I wasn’t dead yet. I was still living, and the only person I knew how to be among the living was me. And who I was was a surgeon. I would find a way to be that person again, whatever that looked like now, until death said for certain I couldn’t anymore.

### Returning to My Old Life

Physical therapy was still about gaining strength, but now that strength was geared specifically toward the physical aptitude required for surgery. I worked on extended periods of standing and tactile functions required for intricate manipulation of surgical tools.

The remaining tumor continued to shrink. Emma finally allowed for a hint at a prognosis, stating that an expectation of ten years was not out of the realm of possibility. It wasn’t a certainty, but the possibility supported my intention to get back to work.

It wasn’t until the possibility of returning to life as a neurosurgeon became a reality that I realized how freeing it had been to not hold the encompassing responsibility of life and death in my hands. I couldn’t help but wish Emma had advised against returning to work. If she had, I would have had a justifiable excuse to escape that responsibility. But soon, the desire to be at the helm of the ship navigating life and death beckoned. I had assumed a moral responsibility as a neurosurgeon, and that role was greater than me.

I went back to work, ensuring I only did one procedure a day. I requested the constant presence of another resident, and the particulars of patient care would fall to them.

My first day back in the OR, I was scheduled for a temporal lobectomy, a familiar and favorite procedure. After eighteen weeks, I slipped on surgical scrubs for the first time and readied the patient and myself for surgery. It was second nature, the movements and knowledge coming to me easily.

Then, something happened. I became dizzy and felt like I might black out. I excused myself, knowing my fellow resident could finish, and went to rest. Lying down, I knew what had happened. There is a phenomenon called “neurocardiogenic syncope,” which means the nervous system reacts to a stimulus by slowing the heart rate dramatically. In layman’s terms, we call it “nerves.” My glorious return to surgery was not so glorious after all. I left the hospital and promised to return the next day, when I would do better.

And I did. In fact, each day after that got better. I was settling into my skills again and accepting that I would have to work at a slower pace. As time progressed, I grew more into my role until I was almost back to full capacity after a month.

I was back in action, but I didn’t feel the same. The joy I used to feel while operating had been replaced by fortitude. Managing the effects of my illness---exhaustion, nausea, and pain---was at the forefront of my mind. Still, I pushed on, wanting to reclaim the future I thought had become out of reach.

My cancer was stable, and Lucy was pregnant and due around the time of my graduation. Life was moving forward, and I was determined to keep it moving.

### Finding My Place in the World...Again

The position at Stanford that seemed created just for me was gone. Someone else had been hired while I’d been in treatment. I was heartbroken, but that feeling was secondary to the concern that followed when I heard news about questions regarding my upcoming graduation. The professors no longer knew whether I was capable of fulfilling the full load of my responsibilities as chief. I realized they were right. I hadn’t been working as a fully fledged physician. I’d been a technical consultant, using my skills only in the OR.

I had to prove to my advisors and myself that I could be a complete physician again. I extended my daily hours significantly and reclaimed responsibility for all aspects of patient care. I didn’t think I was going to make it. I was pushing myself to the limit and physically suffering. But being back with patients helped ease the strain. I found meaning again in my duties as a physician by reconnecting with my patients.

The thing about life-altering illness is that the goals or priorities of one day may be different the next. With time seemingly suspended in a finite place, what feels important may suddenly seem otherwise. Death will come, and when it does, it is a singular moment---an isolated moment. But until that day, forming the rest of your life is a journey.

I started to see my journey as traveling through the stages of grief opposite of the theorized direction. What I’d wanted correlated with the different stages. I accepted the reality of death when diagnosed and prepared for it. Then, when it seemed like there was hope, I grew depressed from the plethora of options for how I should face the days in front of me. At some point, something resembling bargaining took place, as I questioned the necessity of needing to go through this illness. Then, that questioning became anger that I had to go through it at all.

My goals and priorities had shifted during each of those moments, but now what I wanted was to ignore what was happening and go back to my life before my diagnosis. I was in denial about the uncertainty of my future, but perhaps that was okay. Perhaps, when you don’t know how much time you have, pretending you have all the time in the world is the appropriate course of action.
