## Likability 4: Listen Well - Encourage Others to Talk

### Principles

- **You can be a good conversationalist merely by 1) showing _genuine_, undivided interest, 2) getting the other person to talk**.
    - You don’t even need to talk yourself, if the other person doesn’t invite you to.
- A person’s life is the most important life to that person. A person’s headache means more to her than a famine that kills a million people. Allowing someone to talk makes that person feel important and flattered.
- If you want enemies, keep trying to one-up your friends. If you want friends, let your friends one-up you. Talking about your own accomplishments makes people feel inferior and envious.
- Often angry people just want to be heard. Customers get progressively tired of being rejected without having their voice heard. If you listen to them with quiet patience, then graciously acknowledge your mistake, they’ll often be pleasantly surprised and dial back their demands.
    - “Thanks for sharing this with me. You’ve done me a favor, since other customers must feel this way. So please share what you’ve suffered through.”
    - The other person might consider themselves a crusader with a cause, but once they feel important and heard, they get all the venom out of their system.
- **Bad conversationalists talk without concern about the other person.** They’re so focused on what they’re going to say that they don’t listen to the other person.

### Tactics

- To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other people will enjoy answering.
- Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.
- Ask people you respect questions about their backgrounds. They may invite you to get to know them better.
- Everyone has gone through what they feel to be tough times, and they like to reminisce about them if they’ve overcome them. Ask about this.
- Even better, combine this with another tip: give sincere appreciation and praise. Tell them how fascinating the stories are, how you wished you had their knowledge of their experiences, how you must get together again.
