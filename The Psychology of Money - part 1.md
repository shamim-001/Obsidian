## Part 1: Why People Fail to Achieve Financial Success

Money is everywhere and touches almost every part of everyone’s life. So why do so few people succeed in mastering it? In this section, we’ll learn why so many people struggle to manage their money well. We’ll discuss why people follow so many different rules when it comes to money and how that can hamper your financial success. We’ll then explore three additional reasons people struggle to achieve financial success: We underestimate the role of chance in financial success, we look to the past to predict the future, and we confuse being _wealthy_ with being _rich_.

### Lesson #1: Everybody Acts in Ways That Feel Rational to Them

In a world that largely assumes that money acts on mathematical principles, why do so many people act in so many different ways when it comes to money? In Chapter 1, Housel argues that it’s because **everybody acts in ways that feel rational to them**—but what seems rational to you isn’t rational to me.

Housel argues that people develop drastically different ideas about what’s rational because **our personal experiences with money define how we approach it in life, but we all have vastly different economic experiences, so we all approach money differently.**

Housel argues that it’s not what you learn but what you _live through_ that most affects your relationship to money. We create mental models of the financial world based on what we experience, and we act accordingly. Housel attributes this to the fact that real-life experiences leave an emotional impact that is impossible to replicate. In particular, Housel notes that while you can learn a lot of financial information from external sources, like textbooks, you cannot truly experience the _anxiety_ of a particular financial situation unless you have lived through it.

(Shortform note: If what you live through most affects your relationship to money because of the emotional impact personal experience has, can fictional sources—like a novel—recreate the emotional impact of a particular financial situation? It’s possible: [Reading about something a character does stimulates the regions in your brain that control that action](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190523-does-reading-fiction-make-us-better-people), so you might feel what the character feels, too.)

#### Early Adulthood Matters Most

Housel contends that people base their decisions mostly on the financial climate in their early adulthood, instead of on their goals or the specific features of investments available to them. He specifies three financial areas in which your personal experience—and thus your views—might consequently drastically differ from others:

- **Stocks**. Housel notes that depending on your birth year, stocks behaved drastically differently in your early adulthood. For example, if you were born in the early 1970s, the stock market increased greatly, but if [you were born in the early 90s, the stock market crashed](http://kitces.com/blog/birth-year-generation-experience-stock-market-investing-baby-boomer-gen-x-millennial-returns/). (Shortform note: One expert points out that [financial advisers aren’t immune to developing stock outlooks based on what stocks did when they were young](https://www.kitces.com/blog/birth-year-generation-experience-stock-market-investing-baby-boomer-gen-x-millennial-returns/), so you should keep that in mind when taking their advice.)
- **Inflation.** Similarly, Housel argues, your birth year greatly affects your experiences of inflation: If you were born in 1990, you’ve hardly experienced it; if you were born in 1960, inflation tripled prices in your early adulthood. (Shortform note: Experts note that many of the factors driving the inflation Housel references, of the mid-1980s and early 1980s, no longer exist. For example, unionized workers now rarely have a contractual provision that automatically raises their wages when the cost of living rises, so businesses don’t have to raise their prices as high to cover these costs. Therefore, [many economists believe that while inflation might sometimes increase in the future, it's unlikely to reach the levels of that era](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/11/economy/inflation-history/index.html).)
- **Unemployment**. Housel notes that different groups can experience the job market very differently: In November 2009, the United States’ unemployment rate was 4% for college-educated white women and 40% for young African-American high school dropouts. (Shortform note: In _[Biased](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/biased)_, Jennifer Eberhardt argues that Black people in the United States face disproportionately high unemployment rates due to both [bias in the job application process and housing discrimination](https://shortform.com/app/book/biased/chapter-10).)

(Shortform note: Housel’s argument that people base their decisions mostly on the financial climate in their early adulthood comes from a study that argued the same. However, the study shares an important caveat that Housel fails to include: While the financial climate in your early adult life remains influential decades later, [you place the most weight on your most recent returns when making an investment decision](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14813/w14813.pdf). In other words, your early adulthood experiences _affect_ your financial decisions today—so your experiences of stocks, inflation, and unemployment may affect your financial decisions today—but they don’t _determine_ them.)

Since your personal experience with money differs drastically from others’, Housel contends, you operate on different financial information and have different values than everybody else. Therefore, behavior that seems irrational to you seems rational to other people.

For example, 1970-born Rick might view stocks as a surefire money maker because they increased greatly in his early adulthood. As such, he might invest heavily in them. But 1950-born Pam might view stocks as an unstable investment given how little they moved in her early adulthood—and instead hold mostly cash. Rick and Pam both view the other’s strategy as irrational—but each strategy is rational within the mental model each person holds.

(Shortform note: The assumption that other people behave the way you do—when they don’t—is not limited to finance but is, in fact, a [psychological phenomenon known as the false-consensus effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-false-consensus-effect-2795030)_,_ which holds that we’re prone to believing that others agree with beliefs that we deem important or probably correct—and most of us think that our financial beliefs are both important and probably correct.)

### Lesson #2: Chance Plays a Bigger Role in Our Financial Lives Than We Give It Credit For

In Chapter 2, Housel argues that another reason we fail to become financially successful is that we underestimate the role that chance plays in our financial lives.

To illustrate how powerful chance can be to our financial success, Housel describes the story of Bill Gates. Bill Gates achieved his success partly because he was smart and successful. However, Housel argues, it was also because Bill Gates was (literally) one in a million teenagers who had access to a school computer in 1968**.** Gates himself attributes his computer success to this fact. Kent Evans was a good friend of Gates’ who was similarly adept at computers. However, Evans passed away in a mountaineering accident. The odds of this were also one in a million. Both of these teenagers could have founded Microsoft. The only reason Evans didn’t is due to chance. Similarly, chance plays a large role in all our financial lives.

(Shortform note: In _[Fooled by Randomness](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness)_, former trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb adds that it’s not just _whether_ you get lucky that plays a role in your financial success but _how early_ you get lucky—as shown by Gates’ success. In the real world, Taleb argues, [early success helps determine subsequent success because if you win an early random advantage, you’re better placed to win subsequent random advantages](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness/part-1). He suggests that Microsoft succeeded not because it was the best software available but because Gates got an early advantage through chance contracts and positive feedback.)

Housel argues that we ignore the role chance plays in our financial lives for two main reasons:

**#1: We don’t understand chance.**

We all know that chance plays a major role in our lives—and, as Housel notes, it’s technically possible to statistically analyze the relative risk of most decisions. However, most of us don’t do this because it’s too hard. Even if we did, there’s no way to know _exactly_ how big a role chance plays in our lives. Since explaining the role of chance is difficult and in some ways impossible, we don’t talk about it.

(Shortform note: Our lack of understanding about chance leads most laypeople to treat luck as something practically paranormal and totally out of our control: You either get lucky or you don’t. However, _[Luck Factor](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/103/1031646/the-luck-factor/9780099443247.html)_ suggests that [you can increase how lucky you are through several techniques like listening to your instincts](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/07/how-to-attract-good-luck/).)

**#2: We misattribute the role of chance.**

We generally attribute others’ failures to poor decisions instead of to chance: Since we don’t know how they thought, we default to the simple story that their thought process was somehow wrong. But we generally attribute our _own_ failures to bad luck: We know what went through our mind, so it’s easier to devise complicated explanations for our failures that involve outside forces—like bad luck.

(Shortform note: Our tendency to blame other people’s shortcomings on their personality but our own failures on our circumstances is an example of a psychological concept known as _fundamental attribution error_. It’s often decried by thought leaders, like Mark Manson in _[The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/)_, where he warns against the urge to blame your situation for your problems, arguing that [only you can be responsible for your issues because you control how you react to and frame any situation](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/chapter-5).)

#### The Risks of Ignoring the Role of Chance

Housel contends that our ignorance of chance is particularly dangerous because many people try to gain wealth by imitating individual financial success stories—but thanks to chance, copying what they did often doesn’t lead to success. Housel argues that many of us try to learn what and what not to do with money by studying the most exceptional financial success stories—like the Bill Gateses of the world. However, Housel argues, the more exceptional the story, the more likely it is that luck played a bigger role in its outcome. Therefore, the more exceptional the story, the more unique it is and thus the less likely you are to be able to learn lessons from it.

So, Housel recommends instead, **pay attention to patterns, not people.** As Housel notes, if many wealthy people did Thing A instead of Thing B, it’s more probable that doing Thing A will make you wealthy. However, if only one person did Thing B and still got wealthy, it’s more likely that chance played a larger role in her success—and doing Thing B is less likely to make you wealthy.

> **Why Paying Attention to Patterns Won’t Make You Bill Gates**
> 
> In _[Fooled by Randomness](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness)_, Taleb warns that although you can achieve moderate success by following the patterns of wealthy people, you’re unlikely to achieve _wild_ success—the kind with millions of dollars and lasting fame—without luck: a positive rare event plus a lack of negative rare events. Taleb notes that wildly successful people might all exhibit patterns of behavior, like a willingness to work hard and take risks, but that doesn’t mean every hardworking risk-taker is a millionaire. [Just because a skill or a pattern of behavior is necessary for wild success doesn’t mean that it caused wild success](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness/part-1).

### Lesson #3: You Can’t Rely on History to Predict the Future

To create a successful investment strategy, you must predict what the markets will do decades from now. Most people base these predictions on past events—but doing this, Housel argues in Chapter 12, is one reason so many people fail financially. He contends that **you can’t rely on history to predict the future** for two main reasons.

**#1: History is a series of unpredictable events, and the future will also be a series of unpredictable events, which means you won’t be able to predict the outlier events that make the most difference.**

Housel argues that events make history precisely _because_ they’re unpredictable: In other words, history is itself a record of unpredictable events. Similarly, the future will also be unpredictable: Just as the past has continuously surprised us, so too will the future continue to surprise us.

He then argues that the biggest events we can’t predict—the outliers—will set off unpredictable chain reactions that will have the biggest impact on our economic futures. But since studying history can’t help you predict the outlier events—or their second- and third-order effects—it’s not as useful as we want it to believe.

To illustrate, Housel describes how the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to today’s student loan crisis. After the attacks, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to shore up the wobbling economy that resulted. This worked initially: Americans took advantage of low interest rates and borrowed money. But they took on more than they could afford, which led to a credit bubble that popped in 2007. Thanks to the ensuing recession, people who couldn’t find jobs decided to get a college degree, which Housel argues led to the current crisis where people hold $1.6 trillion dollars of student debt and default 10.8% of the time. As Housel notes, it would be practically impossible to predict the student loan crisis as a result of the September 11 attacks—but that’s exactly what happened, and most of history follows similarly unpredictable patterns.

(Shortform note: One reason predicting the impact of outlier events is so difficult is because so many other factors also influence the events’ impact. As one article points out, [had the Federal Reserve limited borrowing, their change in interest rates wouldn’t have driven a credit bubble](https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/savings-account/september-11-attacks-destroyed-u-s-interest-rates/)—so there may never have been a recession that triggered a student loan crisis.)

> **Why We Keep Using History to Predict the Future**
> 
> Why do we continue to insist that history can help us predict the future? After all, we’ve been making predictions for thousands of years. So presumably, many people other than Housel have realized by now that it’s impossible to predict the events that make history—or the consequences of the outlier events.
> 
> One possibility is that not knowing what will happen in the future terrifies us; and, as we’ll learn in Lesson #18, telling a story about what will—even if it doesn't come true—comforts us by giving us a sense of control.
> 
> Alternatively, we may all suffer from a psychological phenomenon known as the _hindsight bias_. In _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/)_, psychologist Daniel Kahneman examines why and how we make decisions, explaining that [once we know the outcome, we connect the dots in the past that make the outcome seem inevitable and predictable](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/part-3#:~:text=we%20connect%20the%20dots%20in%20the%20past%20that,believe%20our%20present%20selves%20to%20be). In other words, we don’t remember how uncertain we were in the past—once you know what happens, you believe your past self was more certain than you were, which leads you to believe that you’re good at predicting the future. If you think this, you may also mistakenly believe that _others_ are good at predicting the future, too.

**#2: Modern financial structures are so different from past financial structures that older advice often doesn’t apply today.**

Housel explains that many modern financial concepts have existed for an extremely brief time. For example, the market for cryptocurrency—decentralized, digitized currency—[was valued at $1.49 billion in 2020](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/crypto-currency-market#:~:text=The%20global%20cryptocurrency%20market%20size,is%20known%20as%20virtual%20currency.), but cryptocurrency [didn’t exist in a popular and usable fashion until 2009](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/were-there-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/). Therefore, gleaning financial advice from what happened in the past is somewhat useless because the economic structures that exist are fundamentally different: Investing advice from 20 years ago doesn’t mention cryptocurrency because it didn’t exist yet. So if you rely too much on economic history to predict what’s going to happen next, you will likely fail and may struggle financially as a result.

(Shortform note: In _[Fooled by Randomness](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness)_, Taleb makes a practically identical argument, noting that the difference between modern and past structures makes it difficult to apply lessons learned from past structures to the future. However, Housel focuses on major changes in structure, like options that didn’t exist in the past. Conversely, [Taleb points out that the details matter too](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness/part-2): The Asian markets of the 1990s bear little resemblance to the ones today due to changes in the world economy, but it’s _not_ because stocks work in some fundamentally different way.)

#### Three Rules for Following Historical Advice

Just because history isn’t as useful as we want it to be doesn’t mean you should ignore history. Rather, Housel argues, you need to use it carefully. To do so, follow three simple rules.

**#1: Note the date**.

If you’re looking for specific advice, rely on contemporary history. The more recent, the more likely you are to be living in a similar financial situation. (Shortform note: Housel never specifies what counts as contemporary economic history. Consider researching how old potentially relevant financial structures are, and only review material published after that date.)

**#2: Look for patterns of behavior.**

You can look at broader swathes of history, too—but don’t look for specific advice from it. Instead, use it to find broader patterns and takeaways, such as how people react to uncomfortable situations or to attempts to motivate them. For example, look at what people tend to do with their money when their governments are unstable. (Shortform note: This advice is similar to Housel’s recommendation in Lesson #2 to look for patterns—not specifics—when evaluating the role chance plays in individuals’ financial successes. In both areas, Housel’s advice aims to eliminate the risk that you’ll base your decisions on the effects of random events, instead guiding you to base them on more predictable influences.)

**#3: Be open to pivoting.**

As evidence of how economic changes affect investing advice, Housel points to Benjamin Graham’s _[The Intelligent Investor](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-intelligent-investor)_—an enduring investment classic even though its specific recommendations are essentially useless in the modern day. Housel explains that this isn’t a sign of Graham’s lack of investing skill but a sign of Graham’s adaptability and knowledge: Graham wisely updated the techniques in his text five times in a span of 40 years because his previous recommendations didn’t work as well as they used to as the world changed.

(Shortform note: Helpfully, modern editions of _[The Intelligent Investor](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-intelligent-investor/introduction)_ don’t require you to differentiate between which principles remain helpful and which recommendations are outdated: The 2003 edition includes commentary from a columnist for the Wall Street Journal that points out how Graham’s advice has been timeless through specific major stock market events.)

By referencing Graham’s adjustments, Housel implies that as you implement the lessons you learned from history, you also must pivot when the situation calls for it. When the world inevitably changes—whether that’s through an unpredictable event or because the government introduces a new economic structure—adjust your strategy accordingly. Don’t blindly follow techniques that worked in the past if they don’t work in your current situation.

(Shortform note: How, exactly, will you know when it’s time to pivot because the situation has changed and the advice you’re following isn’t working? In _[The Effective Executive](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive)_, management expert Peter F. Drucker recommends looking at the outcome yourself: [If you don’t know what’s actually going on, you can’t evaluate whether what you’re doing is working](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-5). In a financial situation, pivot when your strategy is no longer increasing your wealth.)

### Lesson #4: We Confuse Being Wealthy With Being Rich

In Chapter 9, Housel shares another reason people fail to achieve financial success: We confuse being _wealthy_ with being _rich_.

Housel explains the difference between being wealthy and being rich as follows: **If you’re wealthy, you have a lot of money in the bank**. In other words, wealth is money you’re _not_ using—it’s money you _could_ use if you wanted to. In contrast, **if you’re rich, your current income is high**: You have money you’re able to spend on expensive items.

Crucially, Housel contends, **you can tell whether someone is rich, but you can’t tell if they’re wealthy.** This is because you can see how much someone spends on items, but you can’t see inside of their bank account to see the money they’re not using—in other words, their wealth. Of course, as Housel notes, someone can be both rich _and_ wealthy, but you can only see how rich they are. For example, if you see both Steve and David buy a $100,000 watch, you know both are rich. But you can’t see that Steve, who has 50 times that in his bank account, is wealthy and David, who’s paying for the watch in installments and has hardly any savings, is not.

> **The Origins of Wealthy vs Rich**
> 
> In _[The Millionaire Next Door](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-millionaire-next-door)_, Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko popularized the difference between being wealthy—having money accumulated—and being rich. Like Housel, they point out that people with high income can lack wealth and that it’s hard to identify wealthy people because they save their money. However, the authors go a step further than Housel: They [define your wealth as your net worth](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-millionaire-next-door/chapter-1), which is your current assets minus your liabilities, and share a [formula for discovering how much net worth you should have](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-millionaire-next-door/chapter-1) based on your income and age: Multiply your age by your realized (taxable) annual income, divide it by 10, and subtract any inherited wealth.

Housel argues that when you imagine having a lot of money, you’re usually imagining being rich: You imagine how much more you could spend. But—as obvious as it seems—when you spend money, you lose it. If you had a million dollars and bought everything you wanted, you wouldn’t have a million dollars anymore. The more money you spend, the less wealthy you become.

(Shortform note: You may assume that anybody who actually _had_ lots of money wouldn’t spend it all as they would instinctively know that when you spend your money, you no longer own it. However, [several millionaire celebrities have bankrupted themselves due to lavish spending](https://www.moneycrashers.com/bankrupt-celebrities-rich-broke/), proving otherwise.)

Housel contends that most people would rather be _wealthy_ than _rich_. Being wealthy—having money in the bank—gives us freedom to take advantage of more opportunities when they arise, which is ultimately what people _really_ want out of money. (Shortform note: Housel elaborates further on the flexibility that people want from wealth, and why it’s so essential, in Lesson #5.)

So why does knowing the difference between being wealthy and being rich matter? Housel argues that it’s because we learn by imitation, and knowing who to imitate—and who to _not_ imitate—can help us protect our money.

In an ideal world, you could learn how to be wealthy by seeing the self-control that wealthy people exercise. But since wealth is obtained by _not_ spending your money, you can’t see the process. Therefore, it’s hard to learn wealth by imitation—you don’t know who to imitate. (Shortform note: Even if you don’t know _who_ to imitate, you can still discover and imitate the habits that lead to wealth by consuming the right knowledge—like by reading _[The Millionaire Next Door](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-millionaire-next-door)_, which describes the habits of wealthy people.)

But it’s easy to see and imitate people who are rich—and if you don’t understand they might not also be wealthy, you may assume that being wealthy means you can spend money as you wish. But this is the exact opposite of wealth; this will impoverish you. When you understand the difference between being rich and being wealthy, you avoid this trap and prevent yourself from draining your money away.

(Shortform note: Stanley and Danko don’t argue that people who are rich but not wealthy become so by imitating other rich people and overspending; rather, they argue that [they’re unknowingly imitating their lower-income parents](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-millionaire-next-door/chapter-2). Stanley and Danko suggest these rich people mainly want to be “better off than their parents.” But they learned from their parents that the purpose of money is to “spend it when you have it”—and so they spend to _appear_ better off than their parents now, instead of realizing that the purpose of money is to save or invest it so that you can grow wealthy.)
