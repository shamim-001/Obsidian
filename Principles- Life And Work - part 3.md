## Part 3: Putting the Principles Together | Chapter 12: Dalio’s Process for Achieving Success

Many of the ideas Dalio discussed in previous chapters form the foundation for his process for achieving success in any context. This involves five steps:

1. Clarify your goals.
2. Recognize problems.
3. Find their primary source.
4. Come up with solutions.
5. Do the tasks required to completion.

Dalio says that these five steps form a loop. Once you complete one turn of the loop, you’ll then look at your results and use what you learned to go through the process again, setting new, higher goals.

(Shortform note: The downside of setting goals is that [you spend a lot of time in a “failure state,”](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-problem-with-goals-2017-3) and you feel joy only fleetingly after achieving your goal. Thus, some [experts recommend focusing more on the process](https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-goal-setting-mistake-amy-cuddy-2016-8) and small wins rather than the ultimate goal. This is why Dalio’s process is so useful—it focuses on _all_ the steps toward success and what you can gain at each stage.)

In this chapter, we’ll examine each of these five steps in depth and include how to apply them in the context of organizations.

### 1) Clarify Your Goals

Having a goal will keep you focused and give you a clear direction. If you don’t have a goal, you’ll likely wander aimlessly and never get anywhere.

When determining which goals to go after, Dalio cautions against mistaking goals for desires. He says that desires are typically first-order consequences that get in the way of reaching your goals. For example, your goal might be to save $100,000, but your desire might be to keep buying things you don’t need online.

To make sure that you go after the right goals, Dalio says you should:

#### Think Beyond Money

Money is necessary and gives you security, but beyond covering the basics of a home, food, and relationships, Dalio believes that money doesn’t significantly improve your life. Thus, you shouldn’t set it as your ultimate goal. Instead, he recommends that you first think about your real non-monetary goals, then work your way backward to set specific monetary goals that will help you get there.

(Shortform note: [You can also do it the other way around](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericroberge/2015/05/27/money-is-a-tool-so-stop-treating-it-as-the-goal/?sh=244ecafc99d9): First, make a list of what you would buy if you won the lottery. Once you run out of things to write, your mind will be clear enough to discover the things that _really_ matter to you.)

When setting your non-monetary goals, Dalio urges you to be audacious. If you _know_ with certainty you can achieve a goal, then you’re not aiming high enough. Believe that you can expand your current knowledge and find paths toward goals that seem unattainable.

(Shortform note: While Dalio advocates setting stretch goals, some experts warn that [it can do more harm than good](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2013/01/02/why-setting-goals-can-do-more-harm-than-good/?sh=17f57cea115a), leading employees to focus on the wrong things and to engage in unethical behavior. To avoid this, research suggests setting learning or mastery goals rather than performance goals.)

#### Stay Focused

Balance the belief that you can have just about _anything_ you want with the reality that you can’t have _everything_ you want: Chasing too many goals at once spreads your attention and keeps you from achieving any of them, Dalio cautions. Don’t be afraid to reject _good_ options to focus your pursuit on just the _best_ ones.

(Shortform note: Staying focused on just a few audacious goals can help ensure long-term success. In _[Built to Last](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last)_, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras write that one key behind the longevity of enduring companies is that they refuse to be complacent and commit to [bold, risky goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last/chapter-5) that have a 50 to 70% chance of success.)

##### How Organizations Can Stay Focused on the Right Goals

In your organization, staying focused means aligning your goals with your values, getting people to understand how their tasks and responsibilities are connected to the goals, and reviewing goals at least once a quarter to make sure you’re on track.

(Shortform note: Your employees need to understand how they contribute to your organization’s goals because having a sense of purpose is a stronger motivator than passion and pushes them to overcome obstacles. In _[The Power of Moments](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments)_, the authors write that you should [reconnect team members to the work’s meaning](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-10-12) by showing them the impact of what they do.)

### 2) Recognize Problems and Don’t Condone Them

Problems are the challenges that get in the way of reaching your goals. Dalio says that you have to overcome your ego to recognize your problems: Examine yourself unflinchingly and understand your weaknesses objectively, rather than shying away from them. He emphasizes that this step is about simply **identifying what’s wrong, not coming up with ways to fix it.**

In addition to his advice for overcoming your ego that we explored in Part 2, he offers these tips for recognizing problems:

#### Be Accountable

Dalio states that every failure is _your personal_ failure—it means you weren’t creative or flexible or determined enough to achieve your goal. Get over your desire for comfort, and hold yourself accountable by acknowledging your weaknesses and problems that led or that could lead to failure.

Keep in mind that acknowledging your problems isn’t the same as surrendering to them—acknowledging problems means being aware of them so you can find a way to fix them and reach your goal; surrendering means giving up, which means you’ll never reach your goal.

(Shortform note: According to _[Extreme Ownership](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership)_, leaders also have to [be accountable for their team members’ failures](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership). If a subordinate makes a mistake, reflect on whether you provided the information and resources they needed to succeed. You also have to fill in the gaps of their training to prevent them from making the same mistake again.)

#### Be Precise and Prioritize

There are many problems that can come up as you try to reach your goals. Dalio says that you should be very precise when describing them because the more precise you are, the better the solutions you can design.

Your time and energy are finite, so it’s important to determine which problems deserve more of your attention. Dalio advises prioritizing those that will give you the biggest returns when solved, while also devoting some time to looking at small problems that may be telling of bigger issues.

(Shortform note: If you’re feeling stuck and unable to find solutions, try to go back to your problem statement and [change the way you describe the problem](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223588). Describing the problem differently can open up different avenues of thinking, trigger new associations, and lead to more creative solutions.)

##### How Organizations Can Be Precise

To precisely describe problems in your organization, you should name specific people involved. Don’t generalize by using “we,” “they,” and “someone.”

(Shortform note: In your organization, avoid saying, “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions,” because this might lead to half-baked solutions from people who lack understanding of the real problem. In [Originals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/originals), Adam Grant says that you should instead [encourage employees to identify the issues](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/originals/chapter-7) even if they haven’t figured out the solutions yet.)

#### Don’t Tolerate Problems

Dalio says that there’s no difference between not identifying a problem, and identifying a problem but not doing anything about it. Both of these things keep you from reaching your goals. If you avoid solving problems because they seem too difficult, your situation will only get worse.

(Shortform note: Avoiding problems can not only exacerbate them but also increase your stress and anxiety—so it’s important to get a handle on your avoidance. To [stop yourself from using avoidance](https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/how-to-stop-avoiding-things-that-overwhelm-you.html) as a coping mechanism, focus on the next step instead of being overwhelmed by looking at a distant finish line.)

##### How Organizations Can Practice Zero Tolerance for Problems

People in your organization shouldn’t be afraid of discovering and reporting problems. Dalio says that you should demonstrate that it’s OK to make mistakes, and that you shouldn’t fire people for making an honest mistake, because this incentivizes hiding errors. However, **it should be unacceptable for people to hide mistakes or resist identifying and learning from them.**

> **A Healthy Approach to Mistakes**
> 
> Your team can only learn from their mistakes, problems, and failures if they’re not afraid to admit them. In _[Creativity, Inc.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc)_, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull offers actionable [tips for taking away the negative stigma of failure](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-3) and promoting conversation around it:
> 
> - **Determine your company’s view of failure.** Think about what happens when you discover a mistake. If people tend to look for a scapegoat or do nothing, then your company likely has a negative view of failure. Change this mindset by setting an example: When you make mistakes, own up to them, explain what you learned, and move forward.
>     
> - **Build trust.** Encourage managers to let go of micromanaging and embrace their role of creating an environment where people are free to fail and pick themselves up. You can make them feel more comfortable doing this by building trust through repeated instances of being transparent and candid.
>     
> - **Keep pushing forward.** Instead of planning ways to avoid failure, you should make plans to move forward despite failure, even if they’re risky. Create a failure roadmap to help keep you on track.
>     
> - **Know when to let go of projects or people.** While some failure is necessary for growth, _repeated_ failure is a sign that people aren’t learning from their mistakes. In this case, you’ll have to put a stop to a project or replace the people involved, and analyze the failure and use what you learned to make better decisions moving forward.
>     

Sometimes people don’t even realize that there’s a problem. Dalio warns of two situations where this can happen: First is the **boiling frog syndrome**, where things slowly but progressively get worse without anyone noticing until it’s too late. Second is **groupthink**, where someone sees something wrong but assumes that it’s not a problem because no one else has brought it up. To get over these barriers, Dalio says it’s important to speak up right away when you see anything that seems amiss and to train your team members to speak up as well.

(Shortform note: Both the [boiling frog syndrome](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hennainam/2013/08/28/leadership-and-the-boiling-frog-experiment/?sh=63cf90cb6e21) and [groupthink](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/202010/what-is-groupthink-and-how-can-leaders-avoid-it) may stem from a fear of voicing opposing concerns. Team members may be more comfortable speaking up if they don’t feel pressured to agree with their boss. Consider that _you_ might be a problem: Try [removing yourself from the decision-making process](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/202010/what-is-groupthink-and-how-can-leaders-avoid-it) and acting as a facilitator instead.)

### 3) Find The Primary Source of a Problem

Often, problems can unfold as a chain reaction, and the problem you’re looking at is just a syndrome of the primary source (what Dalio calls the “root cause”). Using a medical analogy, **your problems are symptoms, and the primary source is the disease**. To stop your symptoms, you need to cure the disease. Likewise, to be able to truly solve your problems, you must identify the primary source.

- For example, your immediate (or proximate) problem might be that you feel tired at work because you don’t sleep long enough, but the primary source is deeper than this—you might not sleep long enough because you lack the discipline to put down your phone at night.

In organizations, a common mistake is the tendency to deal with problems as one-time events, rather than diagnosing problems with the organization. If you don’t address the primary source, the problem will keep occurring again and again. Dalio reiterates that you should **focus on what the problem is and what caused it, before worrying about how to solve it**.

> **Get a Clearer Picture of the Problem**
> 
> Many people rush to solve a problem because it gives them a sense of comfort and accomplishment. However, addressing the _symptom_ of a problem rather than the _source_ can make things worse. Keep the following guidelines in mind to [uncover the fundamental cause of the issue](https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-to-avoid-rushing-to-solutions-when-problem-solving):
> 
> - **Look at the facts, not just the data.** Look beyond spreadsheets and instead gather facts through observation. A report can tell you how often a team member misses deadlines, but it doesn’t show that the team member is working with an archaic laptop that constantly breaks down.
>     
> - **Reframe your problem statements.** You should clearly and precisely describe what the problem is. This leads to more detailed questions that lead to better solutions.
>     
> - **Work your way backward.** Use a [fishbone diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram): Start with the problem, then branch out into factors that can help you identify underlying issues creating the problem. For example, the problem of a missed deadline can have six factors: people, method, measurement, equipment, environment, and materials. List the possible problems under each category (such as “no communication from client” under people, or “no means to track progress” under measurement) to see all the contributing factors.
>     

To diagnose the primary source of problems, Dalio has the following tips:

#### Pay Attention to Your Habits

Your bad personal habits are often related to your problems. Dalio says that if you can identify and rid yourself of your top three harmful habits, you may address some primary sources of your problems and more quickly reach your goals.

(Shortform note: Author James Clear says that it can be hard to break bad habits because they give you some sort of benefit. For example, smoking can help you relax, or scrolling through social media for hours can help you feel connected. [To break a bad habit](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-break-a-bad-habit), you should thus substitute it with a behavior that gives the same benefit—instead of smoking, you can go for a walk; instead of checking social media, you can chat with a friend.)

#### Ask Probing Questions

To get to the primary source of a problem, keep asking, “Why didn’t things go as they should have?” repeatedly. Dalio says this allows you to get past the first answer to a problem until you arrive at the primary source. (Shortform note: This method is known as the “[five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys).” In practice, you might need to ask “why” more or less than five times, depending on how many layers of issues you find.)

##### How Organizations Can Probe Deeper

To get a full view of the problem and its primary sources, ask questions about outcomes, persons in charge, responsibilities, and the design of your team, organization, or systems. Dalio warns that this type of questioning can put people on the defensive. When they’re worried about being replaced, they might put their self-interest ahead of solving the problem and refuse to be accountable.

> **Use the “Five Whys” Objectively in Your Organization**
> 
> You can use the “five whys” to probe deeper into problems in your organization, but it can devolve into a finger-pointing session. In _[The Lean Startup](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-lean-startup)_, author Eric Ries suggests a few [ways to avoid this](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-lean-startup/chapter-11):
> 
> - **Make sure everyone affected by the problem is present.** This keeps those who aren’t in the room from turning into scapegoats.
>     
> - **Treat mistakes as opportunities for growth.** Create a culture where people aren’t afraid to open up about their mistakes.
>     
> - **Test out the Five Whys method slowly.** Ries recommends starting with smaller problems so that the tangents are fewer, the stakes are lower, and the actionables are easier to implement.
>     
> - **Assign someone to be in charge.** A senior person should facilitate discussions, mediate disagreements, and follow up on actionables.
>     

### 4) Come Up With Solutions

**Remember that diagnosing a problem should lead to improvements and positive outcomes.** Otherwise, it’s just a waste of time. Dalio gives the following tips for coming up with solutions once you’ve found the core of your problem:

#### Make a Plan

Think about everything that happened that has led to the problem at hand. Then, figure out the changes you need to produce better outcomes in the future. Write down the specific tasks and timelines you come up with.

Visualize what must happen and when in order to overcome your problems and reach your goals. Write down the specific tasks and timelines you come up with.

(Shortform note: During the planning stage, you should also [identify potential problems or flaws within your plan](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annlatham/2017/11/26/3-mistakes-you-make-when-planning/?sh=44cb44487e6c), assess how serious and likely they are, and come up with contingencies.)

When coming up with solutions, Dalio says to consider the second- and third-order consequences of any change. (As we’ve discussed, these are the domino effects of an action.) Also consider that the same problem may be happening in other teams or departments. He says that if it’s a problem across the board, then you may need to redesign the entire machine to address a fundamental problem.

> **How to Address Problematic System Structures**
> 
> In _[Thinking in Systems](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-systems),_ author Donella H. Meadows describes the following [“system traps,” or system structures that often lead to problematic patterns of behavior](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-systems/chapter-5) in business and in the real world, and their corresponding solutions:
> 
> - **Policy resistance—**this happens when those in a system have personal goals that differ from the system policies. This results in people within the same system moving toward different goals, like a game of tug of war. The solution is to give up the policy and to develop one that gets everyone aligned.
>     
> - **Drift to low performance—**those in the system become complacent and don’t notice a gradual decline in performance. The solution is to set absolute standards that aren’t dependent on previous performance, or to set the bar relative to the best performance, not the worst.
>     
> - **Tragedy of the commons—**everyone acts in their own self-interest without realizing how their behavior has an impact on others, eventually leading to self-destruction. The solution is to strengthen the feedback loop between behaviors and consequences.
>     
> - **Rule beating—**those in the system find loopholes in rules, enabling them to be compliant while still undermining the system. The solution is to figure out the ways people can evade rules and design better rules to prevent this.
>     
> - **Optimizing for the wrong goal—**those in the system progress toward a goal that isn’t the desired result. The solution is to accurately define a goal and proper metrics that quantify progress toward that goal.
>     

#### Communicate the Plan

Write down a detailed plan, including tasks and timelines, and make sure everyone sees it. Keep going back to your plan to check on your progress.

> **How to Effectively Communicate a New Plan**
> 
> Communicating your plan doesn’t automatically mean that people will buy into it. Here’s how you can effectively [communicate a new strategy](https://hbr.org/2011/08/eight-ways-to-energize-your-te) and, more importantly, get your team on board:
> 
> - Keep it simple, but connect it to your purpose. The plan should be easy to understand and inspiring, while reminding your employees of how it’s related to your organization’s bigger goal.
>     
> - Make a communication framework based on three pillars: **Inspire**—your message should be memorable and exciting; **educate**—break out into small groups and have dialogues about people’s roles in the new strategy; and **reinforce**—repeat the strategy through various channels.
>     
> - Assign ambassadors to deliver important messages. Employees will be more receptive to their peers than to the company CEO.
>     

### 5) Do the Tasks Required to Completion

Once you have your plan, Dalio outlines three tactics to see it through:

#### Have Good Work Habits

Dalio says that successful people typically have to-do lists. They make sure to tick off each task on the list in order of priority.

(Shortform note: Other [habits that successful people practice](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2021/05/30/5-work-habits-of-the-worlds-most-successful-people/?sh=f4ab6e05466f) include multitasking strategically (also known as batching), setting a routine, and scheduling time for creative thinking.)

#### Measure Your Progress by Setting Well-Defined Metrics

You can’t manage what you can’t measure, so Dalio encourages you to have metrics for every goal. These metrics can help you see if you’re hitting your targets, falling behind, or not moving at all. If you find that you’re falling behind or remaining stagnant, it means there’s a problem that you need to diagnose and solve.

##### How Organizations Can Measure Progress

Have team members regularly report on their planned and actual progress, and forecast the progress to come. Hold people accountable for their responsibilities.

(Shortform note: [Making these check-ins a regular activity](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/measure-what-matters/chapters-10-11) allows you to promptly see if there’s anything wrong and enables you to recalibrate right away. Additionally, these check-ins can reveal otherwise underappreciated signs of progress to employees, which studies have shown to be a greater motivation than bonuses or recognition.)

#### Stay Motivated

Remember the goals you want to achieve and how your plans will help you achieve those goals. If you lose sight of your goals, you will lose motivation in your plan. To stay motivated, Dalio says you should only work on goals that excite you. He also says that you should expect failures, but that you shouldn’t be frustrated by them because you can always find creative ways to overcome them.

(Shortform note: While Dalio says that excitement is an important element to staying motivated, [excitement can be fleeting](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-to-motivate-yourself-to-do-things-you-dont-want-to-do). Instead, focus on your purpose, and come up with a strategy to keep doing things even when you aren’t feeling excited. This might mean getting other people involved, finding ways to gain momentum, or pairing unexciting activities with those that give you pleasure.)

##### How Organizations Can Motivate People

Dalio says you can use rewards or punishments to motivate people to reach goals, but it’s important to be consistent throughout the organization—for example, one department shouldn’t get a bigger bonus than another for reaching a collective goal. While Dalio mentions the long hours it may take to reach a goal, he also highlights the importance of resting to avoid burnout and of celebrating successes.

> **The Work Doesn’t Stop**
> 
> Celebrating success doesn’t mean you can be complacent. In _[Think Like a Rocket Scientist](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist),_ author Ozan Varol writes that success isn’t final—you’re only as good as your last win, so you should strive to keep growing. He writes that you can learn these [lessons from success to help you avoid becoming complacent](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist):
> 
> - **Reflect on “near misses.”** Think about the instances when things could have gone either way. This can help you prepare for similar situations in the future.
>     
> - **Objectively analyze every decision.** Success can make you feel invincible, but always assume that things can go wrong. With every decision, use a premortem analysis to run through possible outcomes and how you can safeguard yourself against potential issues. Then, after you’ve made the decision, use a postmortem analysis to determine which outcomes were due to skill or due to pure luck.
