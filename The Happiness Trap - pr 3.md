## Principle #3: Expansion

In the last chapter, you learned about defusion, a mindfulness technique that allows you to recognize your thoughts as thoughts rather than as reality.

In this chapter, we’ll examine the next principle of ACT: expansion. In a nutshell, expansion does for the feelings and urges of our physical body what defusion does for the thoughts and images of our thinking self. **With the technique of expansion, we learn how to use our observing self to create space for the negative feelings and urges in our bodies**, allowing us to stop struggling with our emotions and instead focus on taking meaningful action to improve our lives.

This chapter begins by discussing what, exactly, emotions are and how they function. Then, it tackles the subject of the “fight button,” a metaphor for the fight-or-flight response we experience in response to strong emotions. Finally, we’ll dive into the technique of expansion and how to apply it.

### What Are Emotions?

Harris begins by pointing out that there is no scientific consensus about what emotions are. However, experts generally agree on three things:

1. The “midbrain,” or middle portion of the brain, is the source of emotion.
2. Emotions involve complicated physical changes. These changes are distributed throughout the body and affect a number of physiological factors such as heart rate, hormone levels, and nervous system activation.
3. The physical changes associated with emotion are accompanied by urges to take specific actions (called “action tendencies”). For instance, if you become angry, you might become more likely to respond aggressively to other people, even if the other people are well-intentioned.

This doesn’t mean that emotions _cause_ us to behave in particular ways, only that **emotions are frequently accompanied by urges to act**. Following through on these urges when we’re experiencing a strong emotion may cause us to regret those actions in the long run. For example, it’s common for people to be angry, say something cruel that they might not have said under ordinary circumstances, then regret having said it.

In general, Harris explains, the experience of an emotion occurs in three steps:

1. **Something significant occurs.** It can be internal (like a negative thought) or external (something that happens outside of you).
2. **The brain judges whether the event is good or bad.** Simultaneously, the brain sends signals to the rest of the body to prepare it to respond to the event. In particular, Harris argues, if the brain decides that the event is “bad,” we experience the fight-or-flight response.
3. **We begin to experience a number of physiological changes, accompanied by feelings and urges** in our bodies. Our thinking self interprets these feelings and urges as “emotion.”

Let’s make this process clearer with an example.

1. Fred is driving to work. He’s on the freeway when the car in front of him comes to a sudden halt. He applies the brakes as quickly as he can, but he still ends up in a small fender-bender.
2. Immediately afterward, Fred’s body floods with adrenaline. His brain registers that he’s been in an accident and judges this experience to be a “bad” event. His fight-or-flight reflex activates.
3. The first sensation that Fred feels is a white-hot flash of anxiety. He doesn’t want to be late for work, but he realizes that he probably will be. Then, he feels anger pooling at the back of his neck. The other person’s reckless driving caused the accident. As Fred pulls over, he feels the urge to get out of the car and yell at the other driver.

This process generates a single instance of emotion, or a feeling. Harris asserts that **we register our feelings as discrete sensations in our physical body**. Over a protracted period of time, many similar episodes of emotion coalesce to form a “mood.” (Shortform note: The technique of expansion deals with individual feelings, not moods.)

> **The Three Components of Emotion**
> 
> There’s no scientific consensus on emotion, but most scientists agree that [emotions have three components, which](https://online.uwa.edu/news/emotional-psychology/) echo Harris’s steps: experiences (or stimuli), physiological changes, and behavioral responses. However, scientists disagree about the order in which we experience each of these elements of emotion.
> 
> Let’s treat each of these elements in turn:
> 
> - The first component of an emotion is an experience, or stimulus. The experience of a stimulus is subjective—for example, one person may respond to a child’s doll with fear while someone else wouldn’t have this response. Harris’s definition of an “event” reflects that this stimulus can be external (seeing the doll) or internal (the feeling associated with the doll).
>     
> - The second component is physiological changes. These physiological changes are regulated by the autonomic nervous system, which controls our fight-or-flight response (among other things). Physiological changes are involuntary—the brain reacts automatically to stimuli, whether an approach or an avoidance reflex is triggered. So while Harris’s explanation that the brain “decides” whether an event is good or bad is misleading.
>     
> - The third component is behavioral responses. Behavioral responses include smiling, grimacing, and frowning. This behavioral element of emotion is similar to Harris’s concept of “urges” or “action tendencies” that prepare us to take action.
>     

### The “Fight Button”: How the Thinking Self Makes Our Emotions Worse

As we learned in the last section, the final step in the process of emotion involves our thinking self interpreting the sensations and urges in our body. Harris argues that **the thinking self applies judgments to the emotions that we experience, separating them into “good” or “bad.”** Thus, it treats an emotion like love as a “good” emotion, but an emotion like anger as a “bad” emotion.

These judgments are informed by multiple factors:

- We are conditioned in our childhood to treat certain emotions as undesirable. For instance, a crying child will often be treated as though they should be able to control their physiological reaction to their sadness. This gives the impression that sadness is undesirable, something to be controlled rather than accepted.
- We judge our emotions based on the sorts of sensations we feel in our bodies as we experience them. Thus, our thinking self may categorize guilt as a negative emotion because the physiological sensation of guilt is uncomfortable.

When the thinking self judges our emotions as “good” or “bad,” we are assigning abstract values to physiological processes. These assigned values motivate us to act:

- When we judge an emotion (such as love) as “good,” we set ourselves up to want more of it. So, we chase the sensation and may create more negative feelings (such as disappointment) if we don’t get more of it.
- When we judge an emotion (such as disgust) as “bad,” we want less of it. This leads us back to the happiness trap, where we try to eliminate unwanted feelings and wind up creating more of them as a consequence.

> **The Problem With Defining Emotions as “Good” or “Bad”**
> 
> Research has shown that the logic behind [labeling emotions as “positive” or “negative”](https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/article/sadness-is-always-bad-happiness-is-always-good) may be fundamentally flawed. **There are good things about supposedly “negative” emotions and bad things about supposedly “positive” ones.** Furthermore, we need to accept both our positive and negative emotions in order to live a rich and meaningful life.
> 
> Specifically, classically “negative” emotions have two benefits:
> 
> - They serve as warnings for situations that require our attention. For instance, unhappiness can prompt someone to get out of an unhealthy relationship.
>     
> - They are accompanied by detail-oriented thinking, reduced stereotypic thinking, and greater endurance when it comes to achieving complicated cognitive tasks.
>     
> 
> On the other hand, classically “positive” emotions have their downsides:
> 
> - They increase selfish behavior, stereotyping of strangers, and dishonesty. They also decrease empathy. For example, if you’ve ever been in a good mood and told somebody a white lie so that you wouldn’t ruin the mood, your positive emotion might be to blame.
>     
> - They lead to increased levels of distraction and decreased performance on detail-oriented tasks. For example, remember being a child and feeling so excited about something (maybe your birthday) as a child that you couldn’t focus on anything else.
>     
> - Because positive emotions lower your inhibitions, they can lead you to take unwise risks and even die. The internet is filled with videos of clearly happy people making decisions with bad results.
>     

Imagine this dynamic (the thinking self judging our emotions and setting us up for struggle) as a button in our brain called the “fight button.” **When we activate the fight button, we rebel against our emotions and the sensations that accompany them, creating a whole new host of negative feelings.** ACT calls this “dirty discomfort.”

When we choose _not_ to activate the fight button, we accept our emotions and don’t try to fight them. We may still experience unpleasant emotions, but we’re not locked in a useless struggle against them. ACT calls this “clean discomfort.”

Fusion (discussed in the last chapter) plays a vital role in this process. Our thinking self judges an emotion we’re having, labeling it “positive” or “negative.” If we fuse with this thought, we experience it as reality. As a consequence, we treat “negative” emotions as threats. And, as discussed, when our brain perceives an emotion as a threat, we experience the fight-or-flight response. This creates even more negative emotions, such as anger or anxiety.

So, you might be wondering, if the fight button causes all of these problems, how do we deactivate it?

> **Avoiding Negative Emotions Does More Harm Than Good**
> 
> Another way to describe the fight button is [“emotional avoidance.”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/emotional-acceptance-why-feeling-bad-is-good) In emotional avoidance, we try to stave off our negative emotions, which only makes things worse. (There is a subtle distinction between emotional avoidance and experiential avoidance, which we discussed in Chapter 2: Experiential avoidance involves avoiding internal experiences—including emotions, physical sensations, and memories—emotional avoidance focuses only on averting emotions.)
> 
> Emotional avoidance is generally a bad strategy because:
> 
> - Many of your individual goals may require you to experience negative emotions in order to achieve the goals. If you decide to sacrifice those goals in the name of avoiding a negative emotion, you’re making a long-term sacrifice for a short-term gain.
>     
> - Attempts to avoid negative emotions can’t work. **Your emotional experience isn’t voluntary and trying to avoid a negative emotion (like guilt) is just wasted effort**.
>     
> - Emotional avoidance is a form of truth-denial and therefore a bad foundation to build a life on. The truth is that you will experience negative emotions from time to time and denying that fact in pursuit of emotional avoidance will only make it more difficult to do the things that really matter to you.
>     
> - Emotional avoidance is accompanied by anticipation of the emotion you’re trying to avoid. You become hypervigilant in your attempts to avoid the negative emotion. Specifically, you can experience _anticipatory anxiety_, where your mind comes up with catastrophic scenarios in which you experience negative emotions that have no relationship to reality.
>     
> 
> In contrast to emotional avoidance, emotional acceptance carries real benefits:
> 
> - When you accept your emotions, you’re accepting the truth instead of wasting effort trying to work against it.
>     
> - When you accept your emotions, you can learn how to deal with them productively. Emotional avoidance can’t teach you this, because you spend all of your time trying to avoid negative emotions instead of experiencing them and seeing what you can learn from them.
>     
> - When you accept your emotions, they reveal themselves as less destructive than you originally imagined. Rather than fighting the current of the emotion, you allow yourself to be taken wherever the current leads—and you’re much less exhausted on the other end of the journey.
>     

### The Technique of Expansion: Making Space

As we mentioned, **expansion is a technique that uses our observing self to create space in our body to accept our emotions, rather than fight against them.** To understand this, Harris explains that we first have to develop a concept called _body awareness_.

#### Developing Body Awareness

Harris describes body awareness as using the observing self to notice your physical sensations and where they’re originating—without engaging the thinking self. He suggests practicing this exercise to **attune with your observing self and internalize the difference between actively _thinking_ about your body and passively _noticing_ your body**. If you do notice your thinking self engaging during this exercise, try to recognize that your thoughts about your body are separate from the attention you’re paying to your body.

1. Starting with your head, pay attention to each of your major body parts in turn. Focus on your head, your neck, your shoulders, your arms and hands, your back and stomach, your legs, and your feet.
2. Pay attention to your breathing. Is it fast or slow? Regular or irregular? Deep or shallow?
3. Pay attention to any tension you feel in your body. Often, this is concentrated in the neck and shoulders.
4. Pay attention to the heat of your body. Is it equally distributed or are some parts of you cooler than others?
5. Repeat step 1, focusing on the sensations you experience in each part of your body. Are some parts of you stiff or tense? Are there parts of you that are more comfortable than others?

> **The Benefits of Body Scan Meditation**
> 
> This exercise is a [body scan meditation](https://www.healthline.com/health/body-scan-meditation#benefits). While Harris includes it in _The Happiness Trap_ as a way to build body awareness and connect with your observing self, regular practice of this meditation technique carries benefits that Harris doesn’t mention.
> 
> The benefits of body scan meditation include:
> 
> - Better sleep: Body scan meditation reduces insomnia and improves sleep quality by decreasing stress and anxiety, which are common reasons that people struggle to sleep.
>     
> - Decreased anxiety and stress: Not only does body scan meditation decrease the general symptoms of anxiety (such as restlessness, irritability, and muscle tension), but it also helps you manage stress.
>     
> - Decreased pain: While body scan meditation doesn’t necessarily stop chronic pain, it helps you pinpoint where pain is occurring—rather than feeling a globalized pain—and that can make it easier to accept.
>     

#### Expansion: A Four-Step Process

Now that we’ve developed some body awareness, we can walk through how to use expansion to accept your emotions. Harris identifies four steps:

**Step 1: Use your observing self to connect with the sensations in your body.**

(Shortform note: This step is similar to the exercise on body awareness. If you struggle with it, go back to the previous exercise and practice it until you develop the skill.)

Take a few moments and notice the sensations or discomfort in each area of your body. Remember that we register emotions as physical sensations—essentially you’re scanning your body for negative emotions so that you can respond to them.

Focus on the least comfortable sensation in your body. Notice its dimensions: Is it large or small? Uniform or irregular? How deeply do you feel the sensation? If you can, visualize this sensation as a distinct object with its own material and properties.

**Step 2: Use deep breathing to explore the sensation.**

As you scan the uncomfortable sensation, focus on breathing deeply. Your deep breathing should decrease the tension in your body. As your tension decreases, imagine your deep breath forming an eggshell-like shelter around the discomfort.

**Step 3: Make additional room in your body for the sensation.**

Imagine that eggshell growing in size until your body can freely accommodate the discomfort. Rather than the feeling that the sensation is trapped in your body, causing disruption and tension, you should feel that the sensation has room to move and grow, because your breathing can accommodate it.

**Step 4: Tolerate the sensation, and give it space to exist.**

Accept the emotion, rather than entertaining your thinking self, which might be saying that the emotion is a threat (and therefore something you need to eliminate).

If your thinking self is still active, use it _to reinforce the goal of expansion_: acceptance. This is called “acceptance self-talk.” For instance, you could say out loud, “This is a difficult feeling, but there’s enough space in my body to accommodate it.” While, eventually, you want to be able to practice expansion using only your observing self, these words can help in the interim.

(Shortform note: In the larger context of ACT, expansion is used alongside defusion, which we covered in the last chapter, and connection, which we’ll cover in the next chapter.)

> **The Physiological Effects of Deep Breathing**
> 
> Meditation exercises like this help release tension in our bodies and process emotions that we can’t simply “reason” our way out of. But just how does it work?
> 
> Research has shown that **[specific emotions have different kinds of breathing associated with them](https://hbr.org/2020/09/research-why-breathing-is-so-effective-at-reducing-stress).** For instance, an emotion like joy involves deep, slow breathing while an emotion like anger involves rapid, shallow breath. Most people can remember a time when they were so upset that their breathing became irregular (for instance, while crying) or shallow (for instance, while hyperventilating during an anxiety reaction). It also works in the reverse: If you follow the breathing pattern for a particular emotion (even if it’s not one you’re experiencing right now), you can actually begin to feel that emotion.
> 
> The deep breathing we practice in expansion is associated with calmness and joy. Thus, the feeling of release from emotional discomfort may be our body’s physiological response to deep breathing, rather than a mental and emotional response to the imaginative labor of “building an eggshell” around the sensation.
> 
> Additionally, slow, deep breathing slows your heart rate and stimulates the vagus nerve, which is associated with your body’s recuperative processes, such as sleep and digestion. If you’re locked in a fight-or-flight response—as we often are when we experience negative emotions—deep breathing can engage your vagus nerve and redirect your body’s energies from an anxious or aggressive response to return to a calm and collected state.

#### “Urge Surfing”: Expansion for Urges

When we defined emotions earlier in this chapter, we noted that emotions frequently have two components: physical sensations and action tendencies (also called urges). Harris explains that when we have urges associated with negative emotions, they’re often tied to the control strategies that keep us in the happiness trap.

While expansion in its ordinary form deals primarily with the first component, sensations, a slight adaptation of the technique—called _urge surfing_—addresses the second component, urges. Just as expansion helps you accept an uncomfortable sensation, **urge surfing helps you accept difficult urges.** (Shortform note: Psychologists G. Alan Marlatt and Judith R. Gordon coined urge surfing as a coping strategy for people struggling with addiction. Interestingly, Harris specifically notes that urges related to addiction—as well as those related to survival—are _not_ directly connected to emotion.)

Harris details the five steps of urge surfing:

1. Use your _observing self_ to connect with the urge in your body.
2. Use your _thinking self_ to recognize and name the urge. For example, you might say: “I’m experiencing the urge to—”
3. Use deep breathing to explore the urge and make room in your body for it. (Shortform note: You’ll notice that this step combines steps 2 and 3 of expansion, so you could argue that we should consider urge surfing a six-step process.) Avoid the temptation to try to eliminate this negative feeling.
4. Tolerate the urge and observe it as it changes. If your thinking self intercedes, practice defusion techniques. You can also repeat step 2 of the urge surfing process (recognize and name the urge) intermittently.
5. Decide an appropriate course of action. Consider your values and try to act in a way that is consistent with them.

(Shortform note: We haven’t fully covered the ACT principles meant to guide step 5 in the process above, so it may be useful to revisit this technique after reading this guide’s chapter on values.)

> **Urge Surfing Reframes Urges**
> 
> Urge surfing is not a practice specific to ACT. Rather, it’s [a standard part of the therapeutic repertoire](https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/urge-surfing.pdf) for addiction treatment all over the world.
> 
> Urge surfing is based on the idea that most urges won’t persist for longer than 30 minutes, provided that we don’t give in to the urge or “refresh” it by giving it attention or fighting it. Instead, urge surfing relies on a particular relationship to urges that allows us to tolerate them without engaging with them.
> 
> People often use different water metaphors to explain urges:
> 
> - Some people describe an urge as an ocean wave, which rises, crests, and dissipates. Like waves, urges can vary in size, from small to massive, but you can treat your breathing as your “surfboard” as you ride the wave of the urge.
>     
> - Others describe an urge as a riptide that sweeps swimmers away from the shore. If you try to swim against the current of a riptide, you become too tired and eventually drown. On the other hand, if you surf the urge, you swim parallel to the shore, you can escape the area of the riptide and find your way back to the beach.
>     
> - Others describe an urge as a waterfall crashing down from unseen heights. If you put your body in the way of the waterfall, it will overwhelm you—but urge surfing allows you to step out of the path of the waterfall and watch the water pass by.
>     
> 
> Some practitioners of urge surfing say that focusing on one of these metaphors while you urge surf can help you focus and put your problem—that your urge seems uncontrollable—into perspective.
