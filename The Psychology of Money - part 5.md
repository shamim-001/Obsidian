## Part 5: How to Counter Negative Thinking

In the previous section, you learned several keys to creating a financial strategy that you can stick to long-term. But in an ever-fluctuating market, how do you handle the inevitable bad times? Housel shares three lessons to help you evaluate bad news appropriately: Don’t be put off by either uncertainty or pessimism and remember that even if you fail frequently, you can still succeed.

### Lesson #14: Don’t Be Put Off by Uncertainty

In Chapter 15, Housel shares one key to reacting well to bad news: **Don’t be put off by uncertainty.** He argues that in order to achieve long-term investing success, you must accept that you’ll feel uncertainty as the market fluctuates. Otherwise, you won’t be able to endure the uncertainty long enough to let your returns compound.

Housel explains that investing inherently includes some measure of uncertainty—and the higher the potential gain, the more uncertainty you feel. For example, the longer you let your stocks compound, the more money you can gain, but the longer you have to feel the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what will happen to your money. Conversely, if you hold low-value bonds, you won’t accrue much value—but since bonds are far less volatile than stocks, you won’t feel much uncertainty, either.

(Shortform note: Housel assumes that this uncertainty or discomfort is inevitable when investing—and while some discomfort may be normal, constant discomfort is not. [Several experts recommend strategies to decrease the anxiety you feel around your investments](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/2018-05-11/5-tips-to-ease-investing-anxiety), like checking them once a quarter at most.)

According to Housel, most people try to limit the uncertainty they experience by timing the market—but since timing the market is impossible, they end up losing money. As an example, Housel points to the fact that tactical mutual funds, which bounce between stocks and bonds in an attempt to strategically avoid market risk, generally do worse than more traditional stock-bond funds that stick to steady investments regardless of market fluctuations. In other words, nobody can successfully time the market—not even professionals.

(Shortform note: Ironically, in _[The Intelligent Investor](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-intelligent-investor)_, Graham suggests that [some people time the market not due to fear of uncertainty but due to overconfidence](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-intelligent-investor/chapter-8): They have an arrogant presumption that if you’re smart enough, you can predict how the market will move.)

Therefore, Housel recommends, instead of trying to avoid uncertainty, accept that uncertainty is inevitable when investing. Remind yourself that you’re trading your short-term peace of mind for potential long-term investing success, and use that knowledge to endure the market long enough to let your returns compound.

(Shortform note: In his book, Housel focuses exclusively on the toll that investing _in the stock market_ takes on your peace of mind. But in the blog post he based the book on, Housel discusses other financial areas as well, arguing that _[every financial reward you achieve takes a toll on some aspect of your life, and you can only achieve the reward if you accept each of those tolls](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/)_. For example, you may patent an invention that earns you millions—but you can only develop that invention by accepting the toll working on it takes on your social life.)

### Lesson #15: Don’t Be Put Off by Pessimism

Just as you shouldn’t be put off by uncertainty, in Chapter 17, Housel suggests, **don’t be put off by pessimism.**

Housel explains that we’re likely to believe financial pessimists because they tend to sound smarter and more reasonable than optimists. However, Housel contends, this is a mistake: Given our world’s history of long-term growth, the optimistic viewpoint is generally more reasonable than the pessimistic. Therefore, he argues, you must be able to evaluate financial pessimism appropriately so you don’t overreact when you encounter it.

To react appropriately to financial pessimism, Housel argues, you must understand why it’s so tempting. Housel explains that, while pessimism in general is alluring partly due to our instinct to prioritize threats over opportunities, financial pessimism in particular seems especially reasonable for three main reasons.

(Shortform note: In the blog post he based his book on, Housel presents a number of reasons that financial pessimism seems smarter than optimism that he doesn’t include in this book. Notably, he discusses [how people are skeptical of optimistic viewpoints partly because the finance industry is full of hacks](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/) who’ll scam you with stories that are “too good to be true”—a danger you’ll learn more about in Lesson #18. So while you shouldn’t overreact when you encounter pessimism, it may be unwise to discount it entirely, too.)

**#1: We pay more attention to bad financial news because we’re afraid that it might affect us, too.**

Housel explains that since our modern financial systems and economy are so interconnected, a negative event in one sector is likely to affect someone in another sector—even if those sectors aren’t related. For example, the housing market crash of 2008 didn’t just affect real estate investors; it prompted a nationwide recession that affected everyone, including people who hadn’t invested in real estate.

(Shortform note: In the blog post he based this book on, Housel shares another reason we pay attention to financial news: [Money has competitions, rules, and upsets—like a game—so it’s entertaining](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/). There, he also argues that we pay attention to financial news because others’ actions may affect our own finances. But, instead of arguing that we fear this, Housel argues that we enjoy this because, when you’re emotionally invested in the outcome, watching the game of money becomes more entertaining.)

**#2. It’s easier to make a pessimistic forecast than an optimistic one**.

Housel argues that many people forecast pessimistic outcomes by assuming that the current trend will continue and ignoring how the market might adapt to the world’s needs. However, Housel explains, extreme trends normally don’t continue because the markets adapt to extreme circumstances. For example, Housel cites a 2008 prediction that the world would run out of oil because China would need 98 million barrels a day by 2030 but we couldn’t produce more than 85 million. This prediction didn’t come true because the market adapted: China’s increasing demand for oil raised oil prices, which incentivized people to develop better drilling technologies and to drill in places that were previously economically unviable.

(Shortform note: Instead of forecasting the future by extending current trends, management consultant David Mattin recommends [focusing on what doesn’t change](https://hallandpartners.com/thinking/transform/how-to-predict-market-trends-with-one-simple-principle/)—and the fact that humans inevitably adapt to extreme circumstances may be an example of that. For example, humans faced the consequences of oil overuse on the climate and adapted by electrifying vehicles. Experts now expect Chinese oil consumption in 2030 to be lower than their 2008 predictions because [they’ll use more electricity and less oil in their transportation](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-oil-demand-peak-by-2030-petrochemical-use-cnpc-research-2021-12-27/).)

Because predicting how the market might change is difficult, economic forecasters often take the easy route and ignore it. (Shortform note: In other words, the economic forecasters fall victim to a mistake we learned about in Lesson 3: They don’t consider that unpredictable events might surprise them.)

Furthermore, it’s easy to believe these forecasts because they don’t require you to imagine an entirely new world: They work in a world that’s familiar to you. (Shortform note: We may also believe these forecasts simply because we like them more: The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon where people like something more merely [because they’re familiar with it](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/mere-exposure-effect/).)

**#3: It’s easier to notice negative events because they happen more suddenly.**

Housel explains that progress compounds slowly—over months and years, if not decades. So noticing this progress requires a lot of work: You have to pay attention to small, incremental growth over a long period of time and you have to clearly remember the state of a situation in the distant past, both of which are hard to do. As such, most of us are slow to notice progress if we notice it at all. Conversely, Housel argues, destruction occurs quickly, often with just one dramatic event. As such, it captures our attention in a way that progress doesn’t.

(Shortform note: How can you make noticing progress easier? Consider noticing and celebrating small wins on issues you care about—no matter how small. In _[The Power of Moments](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments)_, Chip and Dan Heath explain that [noticing and celebrating small wins makes the long-term goal feel more attainable](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-7-9). While the Heaths recommend celebrating your wins to achieve your own long-term goals, the idea is presumably applicable to goals you’re invested in but not necessarily involved in, like a political issue you care about.)

### Lesson #16: Even If You Fail Frequently, You Can Still Succeed

You now know why you shouldn’t be discouraged by bad news. In Chapter 6, Housel shares another reason to remain optimistic: **Even if you fail frequently, you can still succeed.**

Housel explains that nearly every successful financial venture you hear about owes its success to low-probability outlier events—luck. These events, when positive, compensate for a larger number of smaller setbacks that a company might go through. For example, **the successful companies that drive investment returns are all outliers**. As Housel notes, the assets of the Russell 3000 Index, which invests in public companies, increased by nearly 75 times over 34 years. But 40% of the index’s companies lost most of their value. The gain was driven by just 7% of the index’s companies—the outlier events—which were successful enough to offset the 40% that failed.

> **The Role of Luck in Successful Companies**
> 
> The Russel 3000 index represents the United States’ 3000 largest companies, serves as the basis of many financial products, and strives to be the “[benchmark of the entire U.S. stock market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_3000_Index), indicating that the companies included in the index are all fairly successful. This fact supports Housel’s theory that it’s luck that separates the _most_ successful of these from the rest, as we can assume that _all_ of them are at least somewhat regularly making smart business decisions, and yet it’s only 7% that break away from the pack with outstanding results.
> 
> This calls into question Housel’s earlier advice to watch for patterns—if 40% of a group as competent as the companies in the Russell Index fail, it’s difficult to know which patterns of behavior to emulate and which to dismiss. This is why even business books, which try to collect and share these patterns, don’t always get it right. Sixteen of the 50 companies highlighted in three business classics failed within a few years of the books’ publications, and only five continued to impress years later.

Similarly, **outlier events drive the success of individual companies.** For example, [Nintendo failed repeatedly to break into the American video game market until the massive success of Super Mario Bros](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sujanpatel/2015/01/16/8-successful-products-that-only-exist-because-of-failure/?sh=e2ee05b1c8c8).

Crucially, **outlier events are powerful enough that they offset the failures**: It didn’t matter that Nintendo’s other products failed because [Super Mario Bros. did so well that it accounted for the losses](https://www.cbr.com/super-mario-saved-american-video-game-industry/).

(Shortform note: In this chapter, Housel only discusses the positive impact that outlier events have. However, the opposite is also technically true: a negative outlier event could drive the failure of an otherwise successful company because it was so powerful that it offset all of the other successes.)

Since we only pay attention to these outlier events—and not to the failures that the outlier events offset—we forget how _rare_ outlier events are (one in a million, in many cases) and conversely just how common failure is. As such, we overreact when failures inevitably happen to our own ventures. But when you realize how common failure is, you realize that **you can fail most of the time and still be successful**—and thus, you can react to your failures appropriately.

(Shortform note: While, as Housel notes, we rarely pay attention to the failed products or companies that the outliers offset, we _do_ pay attention to these failures in the context of individuals’ careers: We often talk about how often the successful people failed before achieving their (outlier) success. Reminding yourself of stories like these—like [the fact that Richard Branson founded 400 companies before moneymaker Virgin Galactic](https://personalexcellence.co/blog/failure-infographic/)—may help you remain calm next time you fail.)

#### How to React to Failure

What, exactly, counts as an appropriate reaction to failure?

First, Housel recommends, **pay attention not to the extent or frequency of individual failures but to the impact of your financial failures on your _overall_ financial health.** Housel argues that the world’s most successful people probably fail just as frequently as you do. But we judge their success by the overall impact their outlier events—the tiny percentage of actions that led to their success—had. Similarly, the outlier events in your life can offset the impact of many individual failures. Therefore, paying too much attention to how often you fail or the outcome of an individual investment paints an inaccurate picture of your financial health. Instead, pay attention to your _overall_ financial health, since that’s what matters.

(Shortform note: To avoid focusing on the negative impact of failure, experts recommend that you reframe your view of failure, [seeing each failure as an opportunity to learn what not to do in the future](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-right-mindset/202009/why-failure-is-your-ally).)

Second, Housel recommends, **remain calm when others panic**. Housel implies that people panic and pull their investments out when the market fluctuates because they’re trying to _time the market_—to avoid the market when it goes down and jump back in when it rises. But this is impossible: Nobody can successfully time the market. Instead, Housel recommends, accept that it’s OK to lose money sometimes because individual failures probably won’t matter in the long run. Once you do, you’ll be able to leave your investments alone even when the market fluctuates—and since they’ll be in the market longer, they’ll compound more and make more money.

(Shortform note: If you’re tempted to pull your investments out of the market when it fluctuates, remember this statistic from _[I Will Teach You To Be Rich](https://shortform.com/app/book/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/)_: On average, [the stock market’s annual net return is about 8%](https://shortform.com/app/book/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/chapter-3) (after accounting for inflation). That number is an average from decades worth of data, which means that your money will earn an average of 8% per year over the long term, even if that rate fluctuates in the short term. So no matter how badly things go, you’ll still probably average about 8% gain in the long run.)
