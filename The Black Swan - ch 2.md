## Chapter 2: Scalability | Mediocristan and Extremistan

One reason that Black Swans are so profoundly disruptive is that they occur in the “scalable” parts of our lives—where physical limits don’t apply and effects tend toward incredible extremes. When a particular thing—an income, an audience for a particular product—is “scalable,” it can grow exponentially without any additional expenditure of effort.

“Massage therapist,” for example, is a “nonscalable” profession. There is an upper limit on how many clients you can see—there’s only so much time in a day, and therapists’ bodies fatigue—and thus there’s only so much income you can expect from that profession.

“Quantitative trader,” however, is a “scalable” profession. It takes no additional energy or time to purchase 5,000 shares of a stock than 50, and your income isn’t limited by physical constraints.

Artists, too, are in a scalable profession (at least in the age of digital reproduction). For instance, a singer doesn’t need to perform her hit song each time someone wants to hear it. She performs it once for the record, and that performance can be disseminated widely.

The problem with scalability is that it creates vast inequalities. Let’s look at the singer example again:

- _Before the advent of recording technology_, a singer’s audience was limited to those for whom she could physically perform. That is, a singer in one town wasn’t likely to prevent the survival of a singer in another town; they might have differently sized audiences—based on the populations of their respective towns—and thus different incomes, **but those differences would be comparatively mild**.
    
- _After the advent of recording technology_, however, a small number of singers come to dominate the listening public. Now that we can pay pennies to stream Beyoncé any time we want, why spend the $10 or $20 to see a local singer we’ve never heard of? Suddenly, differences in audience and income become vast. **With scalability comes extremes**.
    

### The Contrary Worlds of Mediocristan and Extremistan

“Mediocristan” is Taleb’s term for the facets of our experience that are nonscalable. For example, like the income of a massage therapist, human physical traits such as height and weight hail from Mediocristan—they have upper and lower bounds, and if you were to graph every human’s height and weight, you would produce a bell curve.

Mediocristan’s overriding law can be stated thus: **Given a large-enough sample size, no individual event will have a significant effect on the total.** That is, there will be outliers—extremely heavy or tall people—but those outliers (1) will not be _exponentially_ larger or smaller than the average, and (2) will be rendered insignificant by the sheer number of average cases. Most physical phenomena—human footspeed, trees’ rate of growth—come from Mediocristan. (Shortform note: Taleb sometimes treats Mediocristan as a distinct place, other times as an adjective to describe certain kinds of phenomena.)

“Extremistan,” oppositely, describes those facets of our experience that _are eminently_ scalable. **In Extremistan, inequalities are vast enough that one instance can profoundly affect the total**.

Most social (man-made) phenomena come from Extremistan. For example, wealth: It has no readily detectable upper limit; and if you were to include, say, Jeff Bezos, in any average of human wealth, you would produce a grossly distorted picture of how much money most people have.

#### Extremistan—Where Black Swans Fly

In the realm of Mediocristan, randomness is highly constrained (mild): There’s only so much variation in the physical aspects of our world. **Thus, in Mediocristan, _Black Swans are (effectively) impossible_**.

In Extremistan, however, randomness is highly variable (wild): No matter how large your sample size for a given phenomenon, you can’t produce a trustworthy average or aggregate picture because of the _variation_ in that phenomenon. **In Extremistan, _Black Swans are frequent_**.

(Thanks to the work of French mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot, some Black Swans can become “Gray” Swans—rare and surprising events that _can_ be imaginable, if not precisely predicted. See the Appendix for the theory behind Gray Swans.)
