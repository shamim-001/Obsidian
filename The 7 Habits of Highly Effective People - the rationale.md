## The Rationale Behind the Seven Habits

In this chapter, we’ll discuss how and why Covey presents his self-help advice through seven sequential habits. Whether you adopt the seven habits casually or practice them religiously, you can optimize your results by understanding the rationale behind them.

### Why Habits, and Why in This Order

Covey has established that changing your perspective is the first step to self-improvement—but he doesn’t say exactly how to do that. **On one hand, altering your perspective is a _first step_ in adopting the seven habits we’ll explore—and, on the other hand, a perspective shift is also the _result_ of practicing the seven habits.**

In this way, habits have a dual role.

1. They _express_ your character: A dishonest person has a habit of lying.
2. They _reinforce_ your character: Frequently lying makes you a dishonest person.

Because habits have this cyclical relationship with character, they are an ideal tool for Covey’s internal approach: The seven habits are designed to build from the foundation up, establishing a mindset, skills, and routines that help you identify and achieve the things that are most important to you.

Additionally, **calling them “habits” underscores Covey’s intention that these are lifelong behaviors—not one-time fixes.** The seven habits are high-level, universal practices, and they encompass smaller habits that are more specific to each individual. For instance, the first of the seven habits is to take initiative, which is a general approach to life. For you, taking initiative could mean adopting a habit of talking with your manager anytime you’re overloaded at work, rather than suffering in silence.

> **Habits Make Actions Automatic**
> 
> Part of the reason that habits are so closely connected with your character in this dual way is that [they are embedded in your subconscious](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/make-it-stick/1).
> 
> - They are an expression of your character because they surface without any conscious effort to portray yourself in any particular way.
>     
> - They are powerful reinforcers because they persist regardless of your conscious effort.
>     
> 
> As authors Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, and Mark A. McDaniel explain in _[Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674729018)_, **this is the crux of habits’ value: When a behavior becomes subconscious, it’s on autopilot,** leaving your conscious mind free to tackle other things.
> 
> In other words, habits essentially put good behavior on cruise control. This does two critical things:
> 
> - It ensures that you continue the behavior long term
>     
> - It preserves your mental energy for more good choices
>     

Furthermore, Covey prescribes the seven habits in a specific sequence, which aims to foster an interdependent perspective, which he says is crucial to being effective in all aspects of life—from marriage to family to the workplace. **Interdependent people can take care of their own needs, but they also recognize that a collaborative team or partnership is greater than the sum of its parts.**

(Shortform note: Interdependence is also critical to problem-solving in organizations, and communities. For example, while independence-oriented nationalism is on the rise, experts warn that [globalist approaches are necessary to tackle the biggest challenges facing our world](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/chapters-7-8), including climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the threat of nuclear war. And the Covid-19 pandemic reinforced [the same lesson in starker terms](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/a-global-pandemic-requires-a-world-effort-to-end-it-none-of-us-will-be-safe-until-everyone-is-safe).)

Covey asserts that you can only reach interdependence after achieving _independence_. For this reason, the first three habits aim to develop independence by focusing on internal growth and personal character. They are:

1. Take Initiative
2. Envision the Life You Want
3. Prioritize Important Over Urgent

(Shortform note: Most of this book’s parallels with _Awaken the Giant Within_ are in Habits 1 and 2 because Robbins’s predominant focus is on improving your internal world. As an analogy, if _7 Habits_ were the Bible, _Awaken the Giant_ would be the Old Testament—it doesn’t really get into what happens after a pivotal turning point. While Covey covers a broader range of the self-improvement progression, Robbins dives into greater detail and provides more specific strategies for applying the principles. In this guide, we’ll include Robbins’s strategies for the first two habits.)

Habits 4-6 then build on your independence to develop interdependence through collaboration, cooperation, and communication. These habits are:

1. Find Mutually Beneficial Solutions
2. Listen and Understand the Other First
3. Collaborate to Create Possibilities

(Shortform note: Because these habits address how you interact with others, there are many external approaches for achieving the same ends (such as successful negotiations and collaborations). This guide supplements Covey’s internally oriented advice with behavior-driven tips; although Covey insists that behavior changes alone don’t create lasting results, they’re presumably effective when built upon a foundation of internal improvement.)

Finally, Habit 7 emphasizes the importance of self-renewal, which enables you to continue practicing and mastering the previous six habits. Covey asserts that **self-renewal is critical to being effective**; to explain, we must first distinguish between effectiveness and efficiency:

- Effectiveness is targeting your efforts to get the most important things done. This raises the quality of tasks you tackle.
- Efficiency is getting the most done in the least amount of time. This increases the quantity of tasks you complete.

(Shortform note: Covey’s emphasis on effectiveness was likely inspired by Peter F. Drucker, who said that good management requires effectiveness, which he defined as identifying and carrying out the [tasks that have the greatest impact](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/introduction) on the individual’s and organization’s performance. Drucker wrote that there are five practices of effectiveness: [time management](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-1), [focus](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-2), making a [unique contribution](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-3), maximizing [your and others’ strengths](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-4), and sound [decision-making](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-5).)

Efficiency is appealing because it maximizes output in the short term—but it is unsustainable. Instead, Covey promotes reigning in short-term output in order to prioritize self-renewal (akin to routine maintenance on a machine) and ensure long-term endurance. He describes this equilibrium as the P/PC Balance, which we’ll call output and capacity. Covey illustrates this balance with Aesop’s fable of the goose that laid golden eggs—the goose represents capacity, and the golden eggs represent output. In the fable, the goose lays one egg per day—but the farmer wants more, and quickly. In this pursuit, the farmer kills the goose in hopes of harvesting a bounty of golden eggs from the carcass, but he finds none. Worse, now the goose is dead, leaving the farmer worse off than he started.

> **Choosing Efficiency Over Effectiveness Is Harmful Personally and in Business**
> 
> As an individual, prioritizing efficiency and maximum output without nurturing your capacity to produce leads to burnout. Unfortunately, case studies of this are all around, especially among Millennials (born 1981-1996), who have been dubbed the [“burnout generation.”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) As a whole, Millennials are plagued by expectations that they should work tirelessly, and guilt when they don’t—and now they’re facing the consequences:
> 
> - Physically, Millennials have higher rates of hypertension, high cholesterol, and other conditions that paint a picture of [a generation whose health is deteriorating more rapidly](https://www.bcbs.com/sites/default/files/file-attachments/health-of-america-report/HOA-Moodys-Millennial-10-30.pdf) than previous generations
>     
> - Mentally and emotionally, levels of depression and anxiety among young people is at an [80-year high](https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/for-80-years-young-americans-have-been-getting-more-anxious-and-depressed.html).
>     
> - “Deaths of despair,” including overdoses and suicides, have recently [risen more among Millennials](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-mental-health-burnout-lonely-depressed-money-stress#deaths-of-despair-are-also-on-the-rise-3) than any other generation.
>     
> 
> In a business context, overemphasizing output means prioritizing profits over employees’ talent development and general well-being. Succession management consultant Michael Timms has described how a **[profits-over-people approach creates a vicious cycle](https://availleadership.com/neglecting-the-goose/)**:
> 
> - Company leaders focus on output and profits, neglecting succession planning (identifying and grooming future leaders internally) and employee development.
>     
> - Due to the lack of planning, when an employee leaves, that worker’s manager and coworkers often have to carry that weight while management finds and trains a new hire.
>     
> - The heavy workloads mean workers don’t have time to do long-term planning and strategic tasks, which puts them in a reactionary cycle of meeting deadlines and putting out fires.
>     
> - Stressed and tired, employees become demoralized. Some leave the company, exacerbating the cycle for those left behind.
>     
> - Meanwhile, when new employees are hired, rather than _changing_ the atmosphere, they’re _absorbed_ into it. They, too, become demoralized and soon leave.
>     
> 
> By contrast, effective companies invest in their employees by offering good pay and benefits, creating a nurturing company culture, and providing professional development. Happy employees make more sales, provide better customer service, and make higher-quality products.

### How to Make a Habit

How do you actually _create_ habits? Covey asserts that they form at the intersection of knowledge, ability, and aspiration, all of which are necessary ingredients in a lasting habit.

- **Knowledge**: _What_ do you need to do to achieve a result and _why_?
- **Ability**: _How_ do you achieve that result?
- **Aspiration**: What’s your _motivation_ to achieve it?

For example, imagine you want to improve your interactions with others because you tend to talk more than you listen, which often leads to misunderstandings and tension. To change your habit, you need to address all three aspects of it.

- First, you have to figure out _what_ you’re doing (not listening) and understand _why_ that’s creating the problem.
- Second, you have to learn _how_ to become an active listener. (If you’re taking an internal approach, this may boil down to your paradigm about the balance of give and take in relationships.)
- Third, you have to truly _want_ to make the effort to change.

> **A Recipe for Habit Formation**
> 
> Although Covey lists the _ingredients_ for habit formation, he doesn’t exactly provide the whole _recipe_, so it’s worth exploring processes that can help you turn Covey’s principles into practices.
> 
> _[Atomic Habits](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/543993/atomic-habits-by-james-clear/)_ author James Clear explains that [a habit consists of four stages that result in a reward](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits/chapter-3), which creates a positive feedback loop. Here are the four stages, and how to engineer them to form a habit such as walking your dog each morning:
> 
> - **Cue**—This is the stimulus that signals to your brain that there’s an opportunity for reward. Make the cue obvious (put the dog’s leash near the coffee pot as a visual reminder).
>     
> - **Craving**—This is your desire for the reward, which creates your motivation for acting. Make the reward enticing to stimulate a craving (incorporate something you love into the walk, like listening to your favorite podcast).
>     
> - **Response**—This is the action that you do in response to the cue, which triggers the reward. Make the action easy (put your walking shoes by the door).
>     
> - **Reward**—This is the benefit or good feeling you gain from performing the action. Make the reward satisfying (take some quiet time to savor your coffee when you come home from your walk).
>     
> 
> If this sounds [like the conditioning process that Ivan Pavlov discovered with his famous drooling dogs](https://www.blog.theteamw.com/2019/04/23/the-science-of-habits/), that’s because it is.

### Going Deeper

To gain a better understanding of why interdependence is the ultimate goal of the seven habits, let’s examine it more closely. According to Covey, people can graduate from dependence to independence to interdependence along the “Maturity Continuum,” which we’ll call the stages of personal development. Everyone is physically, emotionally, and intellectually dependent as an infant; as you go through life, you have the potential to become independent and then interdependent. You must reach each level before you can progress to the next (but your physical stage may be different than your emotional stage and/or your intellectual stage).

Here is a comparison of the three development stages:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Overall**|**Physically**|**Emotionally**|**Intellectually**|
|**Dependence**|“You” paradigm: Depends on _you_ (or others in general) to fulfill needs|Needs physical assistance to move and survive (for instance, infants and people with physical disabilities)|Bases identity and self-worth on other people’s opinions and behaviors|Relies on others to form opinions and make decisions (for example, “What do _you_ think I should do?” or “What are _your_ thoughts on this political candidate?”)|
|**Independence**|“I” paradigm: Does things for self without relying on others|Takes care of own physical needs, from feeding and grooming to getting around|Derives sense of worth from within, independent of others’ opinions|Makes decisions and forms opinions without others’ input|
|**Interdependence**|“We” paradigm: Has the capability and self-confidence that comes from independence, while also recognizing the power of working with others to achieve more than what’s possible alone|Can do accomplish physical tasks alone, but asks for help when needed|Has an internal sense of self-worth, but also takes other’s opinions and feedback into consideration|Thinks independently, while also considering information and perspectives from others|

> **Personal Development Parallels Leadership Development**
> 
> While Covey frames these as stages of _personal_ development, John C. Maxwell teases out many of the same traits into five levels of leadership, which he describes in a [book by the same name](https://www.centerstreet.com/titles/john-c-maxwell/the-5-levels-of-leadership/9781599953656/).
> 
> - [Level-1](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-1) leaders depend upon their position of authority and [Level-2](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-2) leaders depend upon the influence they wield as a result of their relationships with subordinates. Job title and influence are external factors, making these leaders dependent on outside forces.
>     
> - [Level-3](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-3) leaders inspire others because of their own achievements, motivation, and discipline—and these assets are independent of external forces.
>     
> - [Level-4](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-4) and [Level-5](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-5) leaders are powerful because of their ability to develop others’ talents. In interdependent fashion, leaders at these highest levels combine their leadership skills with their team members’ talents to create greater results than either could have achieved individually.

Covey asserts that American society overvalues independence, which may come as no surprise in a nation built on capitalism and bootstrap ambition. In our collective admiration of independence, Covey explains that American society not only rejects dependence but also undervalues interdependence, because the latter’s emphasis on working with others appears to resemble dependence. However, **while independence is a critical step in interpersonal evolution, Covey insists that _inter_dependence is key to effectiveness**—presumably not only for you but also your community.

> **_Self_-Help and _Self_-Care Don’t Promote Interdependence**
> 
> Covey points out that the self-help industry is one area of society that particularly overplays the importance of independence. The same can be said of self-care, which became a mainstream mantra in the 2010s and has been described as [the gentler cousin of highly disciplined self-help](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/style/self-care/when-did-self-help-become-self-care.html?fbclid=IwAR0ZAxfMWdYgs7olhCEbR3kHALX_y-m72b3GD2CbXlIIEOkWkLGXjuCHP5w). Regardless of the method, both concepts have the same flaw: **[They focus only on improving and nurturing yourself](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/we-need-to-move-on-from-self-care-to-something-that-cannot-be-captured-by-capitalism), with no mention of how this is inextricably tied with helping _your community_.**
> 
> The term “self-care” is often credited to Audre Lorde, a black, lesbian, feminist writer and civil rights activist. Lorde, who was battling cancer at the time, described self-care as “self-preservation” and “an act of political warfare.” For her, taking care of herself was essential to her ability to continue fighting systemic oppression. However, the term has been [distorted by the current take on self-care](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/we-need-to-move-on-from-self-care-to-something-that-cannot-be-captured-by-capitalism), which often condones pulling away from your community in order to take care of yourself.
> 
> **While modern self-care heavily emphasizes the self, Covey suggests it may reveal _dependence_ rather than _independence_.** He writes that sometimes people do selfish things in the name of independence, such as leaving their marriages and families. In reality, such acts typically reveal a _lack_ of independence: In contrast to their claims, these people are often struggling with dependencies such as feeling controlled or victimized by other people and circumstances, so they change the circumstances instead of developing true emotional independence.

With this understanding, consider Covey’s suggestions for reaping the most benefits from the habits:

1. **Don’t read the book just once**—rather, it’s meant to be a guide for readers to revisit and continually improve in _each_ of the seven habits and _all_ of them collectively. (Shortform note: As an analogy, basketball greats like [Kobe Bryant perpetually refine their game](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-mamba-mentality/be-prepared-both-physically-and-mentally) by practicing fundamental skills. Similarly, if you consistently work on each of the habits, your understanding and mastery of all seven will continually improve.)
2. **Read this book as if you’re going to teach it to someone else.** Covey explains that this mindset encourages you to seek a more thorough understanding of the importance and implementation of the seven habits than if you were passively absorbing the information as a mere student.

> **Teaching Improves Learning**
> 
> **Research confirms that people absorb a subject more deeply when they have to teach it to others.** In a [2018 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410?campaign=wolearlyview), 124 students were told to read a text about an unfamiliar topic with the intention of teaching the information to others. Then, they were split into four groups and instructed to:
> 
> - One at a time, give lessons on the material _without notes_
>     
> - One at a time, give lessons by _reading a provided script_ verbatim
>     
> - Write down everything they could recall about the topic
>     
> - Solve math problems
>     
> 
> One week later, people from Groups 1 and 3 still remembered the material better than those who had read from the script or done math sets. This is because both methods involve retrieval, which is [the most effective way to improve your retention](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/make-it-stick/3) of new information. You can also practice retrieval with quizzes, flashcards, and self-testing.
