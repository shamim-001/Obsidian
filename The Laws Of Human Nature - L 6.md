## Law #6: People Are Aggressive

Like envy, **aggression is an emotion no one wants to admit to having.** For example, we all acknowledge that there are aggressive people out there, such as criminals, but we draw a hard line between us and them. We prefer to sketch peacefulness and cooperation into our self-images.

In reality, **aggression is a natural part of human nature and everyone has it**. Interestingly, it isn’t driven by any violence inherent in our species. In fact, aggression stems from a desire for control, which is driven by a fear of helplessness. Our helplessness comes from many sources: We need other people for validation and love but they’re unpredictable, we have childhood insecurities, and death comes, sometimes unexpectedly, for us all.

We can see this latent aggression in our dealings with others—**unconsciously, we compare our aggression levels to everyone else’s.** When we meet someone who’s more aggressive, we tend to act meek and obedient. But when we encounter someone less aggressive, we tend to feel superior. We might help them, or we might use them. Usually, we rationalize our aggression—for example, someone else started the fight.

There are two myths associated with aggression:

- **Myth #1**: In ancient times, people were peaceful and respectful of the environment, and we’ve only recently developed aggression with the rise of capitalism and consumerism. We could destroy our aggression if we just fixed the system. This is untrue—our ancestors were violent, brutal, and damaged the environment.
- **Myth #2**: We’ve moved past aggression and today, humanity is more enlightened and rational. This is also untrue: We still go to war, politics are polarized, we’ve damaged the environment, and there’s huge inequality in wealth and power. These inequalities will continue to grow because they stem from aggression. In fact, we’re probably getting _more_ aggressive—technology has given us new weapons and there’s a resurgence in public punishment. More and more people feel helpless, so there’s going to be even more aggression.

In this law, we’ll learn how to manage toxic types and how to control our own nature.

### Manage Toxic Types: Aggressors

Because everyone has aggressive tendencies, you’ll occasionally encounter low-level aggression. Simply ignore it and move on. However, **highly aggressive people can be dangerous because they’re willing to break rules and cross lines that you probably aren’t.** For example, when you get frustrated with someone, run out of patience for their resistance, and snap at them, you feel uncomfortable and quickly stop. An aggressor, on the other hand, may have no problem yelling or swearing at someone.

Here are the two types of aggressors and how to deal with them:

#### Type #1: Chronic Aggressors

Chronic aggressors have such strong feelings of helplessness that they regularly act on their aggression and cross social lines. Chronic aggressors likely become that way because of the influence of:

- **Genetics.** Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein found that some babies were more greedy than others—they had huge tantrums and demanded their mothers’ milk.
- **Development.** If a child’s parents don’t give her independence, she may dominate others as an adult, or if her parents beat her, she might do the same to others. This is a way of getting control she never had as a child.

There are two types of chronic aggressors:

- **Primitive.** These aggressors don’t have any self-control and become aggressive whenever they’re provoked. They tend to be criminals or bullies.
- **Sophisticated.** These aggressors hide their aggression because they know most people don’t like dealing with it.

You can identify chronic aggressors by:

- **Their “enemies.”** Chronic aggressors have a lot of enemies that they claim are evil. These enemies may not be objectively bad.
- **Their self-image.** They present themselves as geniuses and victims. The more they push these presentations, the more likely they’re chronic.
- **Their social position.** More aggressive people tend to be at the top of hierarchies.
- **Their obsessive tendencies.** Aggressors want to control their circumstances, even small ones.
- **Their use of people.** Aggressors tend to use rather than empathize with people. It takes time to influence people using social skills, and aggressors are usually impatient, so they force people to do what they want, and this deadens their empathy. If they ever do anything that seems empathetic, it’s probably false—they’re not really listening, they’re sizing us up.
- **Their addiction to aggression.** Acts of aggression induce adrenaline rushes, and other ways of stimulating these rushes pale in comparison. (This addiction is less self-destructive than you might think—even though aggression creates enemies and ill will, the more aggressively someone acts, the more likely they are to scare off challengers. However, the more enemies an aggressor has, the more anxiety she has, so she becomes even more aggressive. She can never stop being aggressive because she’d appear weak.)
- **Their temporary followers.** Interestingly, even though aggressors display social qualities that we’re all scared of displaying ourselves, they do find followers. Their followers are usually aggressive as well and enjoy living vicariously through the aggressor, or being given positions in which they can be aggressive themselves. However, being around aggressors is bad for self-esteem, so most followers don’t last long.

**Avoid dealing or working with chronic aggressors.** If you have to, don’t let them control your emotions. One of their strategies is to make you think about how evil they are and how angry they make you, which takes your focus off what they’re actually doing and makes you think irrationally. Try to disengage.

**If you have to fight with them, don’t do it overtly—aggressors are good at fighting** because they have resources and they’re relentless, and you’ll probably lose. Instead, find out what insecurity is motivating their aggression. Then, you can threaten to or actually expose them. Aggressors fear losing control, so if your actions appear to be leading in that direction, they might back off and go after someone easier. Ideally, connect with their other victims for safety in numbers.

#### Type #2: Chronic Passive Aggressors

**Passive aggressors avoid confrontation, force, or active manipulation, but they still use aggression to get what they want.** Passive aggression is also a way to release tension between the socially acceptable mask, real feelings, and self-image (we can pretend we’re innocent of aggression even though we’re still using it).

Chronic passive aggressors often learned this tactic in childhood as a way to respond to domineering parents whom they couldn’t actively challenge.

It can be hard to identify passive aggressors because their actions are contradictory and confusing. **To recognize these types, look for fake vulnerability, childlike helplessness, and oversensitivity**. The earlier you can identify passive aggressors, the earlier you can put up your guard.

Passive aggressors use the following techniques:

##### Technique #1: Being Late or Absent, Always With a Logical Excuse

Chronic passive aggressors show up late or miss commitments, but always have a reasonable excuse. **This behavior is designed to make you feel superior or controlled.** If you call them out on their behavior, they’ll accuse you of being unsympathetic or adding to the troubles or stress that make them late in the first place.

Recognize this strategy by the nonverbal cues passive aggressors give off while making their excuses. Their tone is pouty and insincere.

To defend against this technique:

**1. Stay calm,** especially if the person is your boss. If you get angry, you’ll just encourage them.

**2. Do the same behaviors back at them.** Be purposefully late or absent and make reasonable excuses. This will make them realize you know their game.

- For example, professor Milton Erickson used a version of this defense on a student who was notoriously late for class. The first day he taught her, when she was late, he and the rest of the class insincerely bowed to her superiority to call her on her lateness. She was embarrassed and was never late again.

##### Technique #2: Making Themselves Out to Be the Victim

Passive aggressors spin situations (even situations they’ve gotten themselves into) to cast themselves as a victim. **The goal of this behavior is to get attention and control you.**

It can be hard to recognize this strategy because bad things happen to everyone. However, there’s an obvious difference between passive aggressors and other victims—passive aggressors like the drama of victimization, but real victims find it shameful and don’t like to talk about what happened to them. (There’s an old superstition that if something bad happens to you, it’s because there’s something wrong with you.) Additionally, passive aggressors may have created the ugly situations themselves—for example, their projects fail because they didn’t pay attention to details.

Some additional clues indicate someone is using this strategy:

- They look bored when other people are talking.
- Their suffering stimulates physical ailments, such as headaches or depression, but only when they feel most insecure or need a favor.
- They target sensitive people who struggle with guilt.

**To defend against this strategy, get some mental distance by getting angry about how one-sided the relationship is**—you give them energy and attention, and they give you nothing in return.

##### Technique #3: Making You Dependent on Them

When you first encounter a passive aggressor, they might be very attentive to you—they’ll offer you help with your work or listen deeply. When you start to depend on them, they show confusing flashes of coldness. You can’t think of what you did to upset them, and you’re not even sure they _are_ upset, but you want them to like you, so you start giving them attention, helping them with their work, and listening to them until you’re catering to them the same way they catered to you when you first met. **The goal of this behavior is to get power over you.**

- For example, some parents use a version of this strategy on their children. A mother might be very attentive to her children, but when they do anything she doesn’t like, she acts cold. The children stop whatever they were doing and direct their attention toward soothing the mother’s emotion.

Another version of this strategy is for the passive aggressor to make promises and then not keep them, or only partially keep them.

It can be hard to recognize this strategy because when you first encounter the passive aggressor, they seem so kind and solicitous that it’s hard to imagine them as manipulators. **To avoid falling for this trap, be suspicious of anyone who’s too helpful too early and don’t let them get too close.** Once they start showing coldness, they’ll be easier to identify—if the coldness seems unfounded, or they get upset with you for trying to create space, you know they’re using this strategy.

**To defend against this strategy, end the relationship.**

##### Technique #4: Making You Live in Fear

This strategy is usually employed by people you work for but it can also show up in relationships. **The passive aggressor never tells you exactly what they need, and you have to guess.** They sometimes praise you and sometimes criticize you for not doing a good job. (If they _had_ told you what they needed, you could have done it, been immune to criticism, and they would have been dependent on you.)

It’s hard to defend against these passive aggressors because they usually have power over you and if they catch you trying to distance yourself, they’ll just try harder. **All you can do is leave the relationship.**

##### Technique #5: Make You Doubt Your Own Decency

Some chronic passive aggressors delegitimize your self-image. **The goal of this strategy is to lower your self-esteem.**

To recognize this strategy, look for nonverbal joy cues when you break bad news. Also, be on the lookout for backhanded compliments, purposeful negative misinterpretations of you, or harsh criticism. They’ll often claim to be joking if you get upset.

**To defend against the strategy, stay calm so the aggressors know that they’re not riling you. You can also hint that you know what they’re up to.**

For example, the French revolutionary Robespierre used this strategy against George Danton. Robespierre “defended” Danton by giving a speech that focused on a detailed list of the charges against him and finishing the speech saying despite all this, Danton was praiseworthy.

##### Technique #6: Gaslighting

If a passive aggressor is gaslighting you, they’ll do something irritating, but when you confront them, they’ll respond by making it seem like they haven’t actually done anything wrong and _you’re_ the one being unreasonable. **The goal of this strategy is to make you doubt your behavior and the legitimacy or your feelings so that you don’t challenge the passive aggressor again.**

To recognize this behavior, look for nonverbal insincerity cues when the passive aggressor is apologizing. They might also bring up some past wrong you did to them. Additionally, they might be nice to everyone else, so that if you ever try to talk to others about their behavior, other people think you’ve lost it.

**To defend against this strategy, whenever the passive aggressor behaves negatively, write it down.** Then, when they claim _you’re_ the one being unreasonable, you can look back at your notes and objectively evaluate whether you _were_ overreacting or whether they’re trying to make you doubt yourself. If they are attacking you, don’t make them angry—they’re probably better at manipulating emotions than you are. Instead, stay calm and try to look at everything objectively. When their criticisms are valid, accept them. When they’re not, don’t. The passive aggressor might stop using this strategy when they realize it’s not working. If they don’t, avoid them.

### Control Your Own Nature: Study Aggression

Most people have medium-to-high levels of aggression, and these need to be expressed somehow. There are three ways you can choose to handle it, and the third one is most viable:

#### Strategy #1: Repress and Control Aggression

Some people are so uncomfortable with their aggression—it seems shameful, risky, and unlikeable—that they try to repress it. As we’ve learned, though, masking an emotion doesn’t get rid of it; it simply relegates it to the Shadow.

**Repressed aggression leads to the formation of an “internal saboteur,” which is an entity that directs your aggression towards yourself.** It tries to create control by reducing you so there’s less unpredictability in your life. It judges you, reminds you how easy it is to fail, and dulls your other emotions because they could open you to criticism. You become too scared to try anything new.

#### Strategy #2: Use It to Develop Skills That Give You Control

When you were a child, your aggression made you adventurous—you wanted to explore, both mentally and physically. You can still use your aggression to learn as an adult by developing:

- **Professional skills.** Having skills helps you feel more in control (and therefore less aggressive) about your job and financial future.
- **Social skills.** These help you influence others, which gives you control over them.
- **Hobbies.** These help you satisfy the need for excitement, which you might otherwise get through aggression.

Skill development has limits when it comes to siphoning off aggression—it takes time and you have to manage your aggression well enough to attend work, social events, or classes or lessons.

#### Strategy #3: Translate Aggression Into More Productive Emotions

The existence of aggression isn’t a problem; the difficulty is how to direct that aggression towards something positive. There are four more productive emotions we can channel our aggressive energy towards:

**1. Rage.** Rage has some negative connotations, but in fact, anger can be motivating and healthy. Anger is only negative when it’s unrelated to reality—for example, it’s directed at a scapegoat, fueled by a conspiracy, or masking failures. If your anger is specifically aimed at something and justified, you can use it to take down a target. It can give you fuel for a fight rather than an outburst.

**2. Ambition.** Like rage, ambition has a negative connotation. However, the connotation stems from enviers who dislike it when other people accomplish things. (In fact, attempting to appear unambitious _is_ an ambition.)

In reality, ambition can be very useful—it motivates you to achieve your dreams, which increases your self-respect. The best way to use ambition is to reflect on what you wanted when you were young and tweak your desire to be relevant to your current self.

Additionally, ambitions need to be specific to be useful—if they’re vague, such as wanting money, you’ll never be able to achieve them because there’s no endpoint, and this might lead you to aggression.

Once you achieve an ambition, pick a new one.

**3. Relentlessness.** Relentlessness helps you achieve your ambitions—when you want something, you keep working at it and you use your full mental resources. Human relentlessness is very strong—there’s little in the world that is invincible to it.

- For example, Marie Curie discovered radium because she kept trying.

**4. Boldness.** Like relentlessness, boldness helps you achieve your ambitions. To become bolder, first, decide you deserve good things. Then, learn to defend your deservedness by speaking up to people in low-stakes, everyday situations. As you practice, you’ll realize that being bolder doesn’t come with negative consequences. When you’re more confident, you can practice being bold in bigger situations, such as negotiations or work.

> **Extended Example: John D. Rockefeller**
> 
> John D. Rockefeller was a sophisticated aggressor who took down many people who didn’t know how to defend against him.
> 
> Like many chronic aggressors, Rockefeller experienced a lack of control early in life—his father was a con man who came and went unexpectedly, and the family’s finances were always unstable. **From these early experiences, Rockefeller learned to be ambitious about money and to dislike disorder.** When Rockefeller grew up, he gravitated towards the oil industry because it was volatile and if he could tame it, he would conquer unpredictability.
> 
> Rockefeller went into partnership with a man named Clark because he needed help with funds, but he didn’t actually want a partner because that would mean sharing control. Once their business was stable, Rockefeller purposefully annoyed Clark so much that he left the company, giving Rockefeller full control.
> 
> Rockefeller bought refineries from other people using a combination of bribery, fear tactics, bankruptcy, and pressure. **He made people so emotional they became irrational,** which is a classic aggressor technique. Eventually, his company, Standard Oil, had a monopoly.
> 
> **Rockefeller felt the need to justify his aggression because he was Protestant and couldn’t square wanting to control people with his beliefs.** He created an “aggressor’s narrative,” a story that reframed his quest for control as part of a purpose. Protestantism already had a possibility—rich people were favored by God because they could give money to the church and community—but Rockefeller expanded the narrative even further—**he decided that getting the oil industry under control was a divine mission.**
