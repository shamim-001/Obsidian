## Books 4-6: Reflect on Logos, Duty, and Suffering

Books 4-6 of _Meditations_ reinforce some important concepts that we covered in the previous sections and introduce several new concepts. First, we’ll discuss the importance of remembering _logos_. Next, we’ll consider our duties in life; duties that arise from _logos_.

**In this section, we’ll also discuss how to avoid suffering using rationality**. In short, we do this by observing the things that we think are hurting us and realizing that they’re not actually dangerous.

Finally, we’ll apply that same concept of avoiding suffering through rationality to interactions with other people. We can meet any insult or annoyance with patience and kindness, simply by recognizing that what others think and do isn’t dangerous to us—in other words, it isn’t our problem.

By following all of these guidelines, we can find peace in life—a concept we’ll discuss at the end of this section.

### Always Remember Logos

_Logos_ ensures that every occurrence is the right one, as surely as if someone had measured every outcome and chosen the best possibility. **Therefore, you should always act according to _logos_.**

Nature also follows _logos_. (In fact, it has to, because it lacks humans’ ability to go against _logos_.) **Therefore, whatever happens in the natural world must be the best possible thing that could happen. _Logos_** ensures that you live in a healthy world and that living creatures as a whole enjoy health and prosperity.

In spite of that fact, _individual_ beings often suffer. This is because nature isn’t selfish. Lower creatures exist for the benefit of higher ones; for example, plants are eaten by prey animals, which in turn are eaten by predators. Meanwhile, higher creatures (like ourselves) are meant to support one another. Everything is connected and related—**all things exist in harmony with one another and because of one another.**

With the above facts in mind, you can accept that everything that happens to you is ordered by _logos_. Consider each event—even events that seem negative, like illness or injury—as being prescribed by nature (which, remember, is driven by _logos_). Such things are no different from treatments prescribed by a doctor, and complaining about those misfortunes hurts you as surely as refusing to take your medicine would.

However, don’t show off and gloat about your obedience to _logos_. Be secure and comfortable in your actions, knowing that you're doing what nature demands of you.

**Finally, there will be times when you fail to remember _logos_.** When that happens, don’t get discouraged—instead, simply pick yourself up and continue with your work. Celebrate being human, including the flaws that come with humanity. Your own shortcomings are just more seemingly-negative events for you to accept.

#### Know Your Personal Nature

People who don’t understand _logos_ often celebrate their good fortunes or bemoan their bad fortunes. They don’t realize that good fortune is something you create for yourself through good intentions, actions, and character. **In short, a good nature will lead to good fortune.**

As we’ve noted, _logos_ drives nature, which determines everything that happens in the world. However, you also have your own personal nature, which influences your actions as surely as the nature of the world does.

To understand your own nature, you must question yourself. Try to find out what kind of person inhabits your mind: a child? A tyrant? A predator, or prey? Once you know that, you'll better understand what your nature drives you to do.

**If you’re not pleased with what you find, you can work to change your nature.** What you think about determines the condition of your mind—your soul reflects your thoughts. Therefore, focus on positive ideas, such as the knowledge that you can lead a good life no matter what your personal situation may be.

### Do Your Duty

**Your work—your duty—should be doing good for others**. This is a crucial point and one which we can prove logically, as follows:

All humans have thought and reason. The reasoning that determines what you should and shouldn’t do is shared between us all, and therefore we have a common, natural law (separate from any written laws). Having common laws makes us citizens of the same thing—to encompass all of humanity, that “thing” must be the world.

Therefore, as surely as you obey the laws of your own land and support your countrymen, you should obey the natural laws of _logos_ that connect us and tell us to support one another. **This is your duty as a rational being.**

If you’re not convinced, then consider this: You’ll be nothing but bones and ashes soon. Since that’s the case, whatever you might seek for yourself in your short life is empty and unimportant. **You might as well seek to work for the common good.**

#### Don’t Pursue Fame

Many people seek fame and posterity. They long to be admired by people they’ll never meet. This is a pointless endeavor—they might as well wish to be heroes to distant ancestors who died before they were born.

**Fame is useless because everyone who remembers you will die.** Even if they tell their friends or children about you, eventually those people will also die. Sooner or later, there will be no memory of you in the world. Entire civilizations now lie dead and forgotten.

Even if your memory _could_ live forever, what good would it do you? In life, praise does nothing except make you feel slightly more comfortable. After you die, it has no meaning at all.

#### Don’t Pursue Wealth

Similarly, pursuing wealth and material possessions is pointless. Consider the traditional meaning of “goods”—which is to say, possessions. Should you really accept that as the definition of goods? What “good” does wealth do for your mind, your soul?

**None at all; material objects have no effect on your soul, because there’s no way for a physical object to reach a soul.** Souls act for themselves—they observe the world and interpret it as they see fit.

Now, consider things such as courage, discipline, justice, and so on. Those are things that you could actually say are good, because they _do_ benefit your soul.

#### Only Pursue a Good Life

**Therefore, you shouldn’t work for material goods, but only for a good life.** You can pursue such a life through selfless actions and honesty, and through a commitment to following _logos_ by accepting whatever happens as right and necessary.

You should help others without any thought of reward. You should be like a vine producing grapes, or a bee storing honey—doing good in the world simply because it’s what you do.

Your only concern should be living well: being patient with others, being strict with yourself, and always remembering to honor the gods and _logos_. (We’ll discuss these concepts further in Books 7-9.)

#### Love Yourself, Your Nature, and Your Work

You may sometimes find it hard to get out of bed in the morning. **This kind of laziness comes from a lack of love for yourself, and for your own nature.** People doing what they love—that is, following their natures—will become so obsessed that they forget to eat and bathe. They’ll rest only when they absolutely must and rise again as soon as they’re able to.

With that in mind, if you find laziness creeping in, you must ask why you love yourself—your nature—less than artists love their art, or less than misers love money. Those others tirelessly pursue their passions; you should have no less passion for your own work.

### Recognize That Others Can’t Hurt You

Note that there will be times when others try to stand in the way of your duty to help others and remember _logos_. In doing so, they’ll try to hurt you (because _not_ following _logos_ and doing your duty is harmful to you and others). However, those people are irrelevant—they might be able to temporarily impede your actions, but it’s impossible to impede your intentions.

**Never compromise with those who try to take you away from _logos_.** Consider how professionals can meet laypeople at a sort of halfway point: They can discuss what they do in simple terms, without compromising the sense of importance their craft has or their own pride in it. You should feel no less responsibility to your own _logos_—share it with those who would listen, but never compromise your ideals just to make them more palatable.

**Ultimately, people who stand in your way can’t hurt you:** The only thing that can hurt you is that which hurts your character. Therefore, others’ thoughts and actions can’t harm you; only your own reactions to them can. If you decide not to be harmed, you won’t be harmed. If you don’t _feel_ hurt, then you haven’t been hurt. **All that matters is what your mind is doing at the present moment.**

Finally, if someone else has tried to hurt you, that’s his problem and not yours. Remember: What happens to you is prescribed by nature, and how you respond is prescribed by your personal nature. In the same vein, what the other person did was dictated by his own nature—those actions reflect upon him, not upon you.

Don’t think that any particular event, such as someone trying to hurt you, was unfortunate—rather, you should feel fortunate you weren’t harmed by it.

#### Take Shelter In Your Community

We exist as part of a larger community. Something that doesn’t harm the community as a whole can’t harm individuals in that community—which is to say, you. Therefore, if you think you've been injured or hurt in some way, you can ask yourself whether your community has been damaged. **If not, then neither were you.**

However, even if the community _was_ damaged, don’t respond with anger. Instead, you should talk to the offender and show him what he did wrong. We'll explore the futility of anger in greater detail shortly.

### Find Peace

**There are many ways to find peace, and they all begin with rationality.** A worried or troubled mind makes it hard to fulfill your duties and live well.

For example, perhaps you concern yourself with material goods or physical pleasures, and that concern takes away your peace of mind. There’s an easy solution: By stripping away the legends and false importance around physical things, you can see that none of them are worth worrying about.

To that end, as we noted in Books 2-3, **always see things for what they really are:** For example, a sumptuous feast is nothing but dead plants and animals. Rich purple robes are simply sheep wool colored with shellfish blood. Making love is just rubbing organs together. Why should any of these things have any sway over your mind?

**Similarly, what others think and do isn’t worth worrying about;** there’s no reason to let anyone else disrupt your peace of mind. Instead, only concern yourself with what _you_ think and do. Always consider whether your thoughts and actions in the present moment are fair and right.

#### Do Less, Do Your Duty, and Do Good Deeds

**Another key to tranquility is to do less in life—to only do what’s necessary.** If you stop to think, you'll find that most of what you do and say isn’t necessary. Many of your assumptions are unnecessary as well and lead to these unnecessary thoughts and actions.

These unnecessary thoughts and actions happen because it’s difficult—often impossible—to make perfect sense of the world. Any determinations that you make are subject to change, because you are subject to change.

Note that while you should do less overall, **you should still stay focused on your duty, whatever it is that your nature drives you to do.** Love your work, and earn your living by doing it, if you can.

Doing good deeds with no concern for yourself will also bring you happiness and peace. Always do what needs doing, regardless of your own fatigue, pain, or illness. Furthermore, never assume that something’s impossible because you find it hard at the moment. If something can be done by humans, then you can do it.

#### Reject Anger

Another important facet of finding peace is rejecting anger. **Anger is never helpful.** Imagine that someone asked how to spell your name. Would you respond by getting riled up and shouting the letters at him? That wouldn’t help him to understand what you said and would likely provoke anger in return. Instead, you’d do the rational thing: Simply tell him how your name is spelled.

Any task can be broken down into steps, just like a name can be broken down into letters. Therefore, you can approach every situation methodically and patiently, without anger.

When dealing with animals, objects, and situations, be patient and straightforward; anger won’t help you to handle any of them. Remember that you're a rational being, and those things are not.

Getting angry at another person’s misbehavior is equally pointless. **Remember, _logos_ drives you to seek what you think is best for you.** Therefore, if someone misbehaves, it’s because he’s mistaken about what’s best. It then becomes your job to show him how and why he’s wrong, if you can—simply losing your temper won’t solve anything.

**If you _do_ ever get angry, it’s because you've forgotten two key points:**

1. Nature ordains everything that happens.
2. You aren’t responsible for what others do.

#### Reject Blame

Blame is just as useless as anger and will also disturb your peace. **Simply put, there’s nobody _to_ blame for anything**—the gods are infallible, and human wrongs are due to accident or ignorance.

When faced with someone else’s mistake, remember that you've also made mistakes. Furthermore, you’ve probably avoided similar mistakes to those the other person has made for bad reasons—such as fear of what others would think—rather than because your reason led you away from those mistakes. In other words, **you have the potential to make the same mistakes as the people you're upset with.**

For example, sometimes you get hurt while sparring. You don’t get angry about that, blame your partner, or suddenly consider your partner a violent and untrustworthy person. You're simply more cautious when sparring with that person in the future. Bring that same mindset to other areas of your life: Forgive mistakes and just be more cautious after one happens.

Also, just like you can forgive mistakes, you can meet any bad behavior with compassion. **All you have to do is remember a time when you behaved that way yourself.** What compelled you to act in such a way?

Now, realize that this other person is also under some kind of compulsion. If possible, remove that compulsion and thereby fix the behavior. If that’s not possible, simply accept the behavior for what it is.

#### Final Thoughts on Serenity

You must have faith that there are order and a plan driving the world—that faith will bring you serenity. Nature is obedient, and the _logos_ that rules it can do no evil.

Whenever you're jarred out of your serenity, there are two constants that you can always take comfort in:

- Nothing can be done to you that isn’t decreed by nature.
- No one can force you to do anything that goes against your personal nature.
