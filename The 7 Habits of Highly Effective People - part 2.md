## Part 2: Improve Your Independence | Habit 1: Take Initiative

**Habit Description:**

- Be proactive—or take initiative—in your approach to life; this means changing the problems that you can change and accepting the ones you can’t.

(Shortform note: While Covey elaborates on the importance of accepting the unchangeable, Robbins’s major emphasis throughout _Awaken the Giant Within_ is on taking control through your [decisions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/part-1-chapter-1) and your [mindset](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-5).)

### Why It Matters

**Habit 1 lays the foundation for the subsequent habits because taking initiative is key to adopting new behaviors and improving your life.** This is the first of three habits that focus on your internal life and independence through your mindset, vision, and priorities (the other two are Envision the Life You Want and Prioritize Important Over Urgent). Covey has dubbed these habits “private victories”; we’ll call them habits for personal improvement.

He writes that every situation presents a choice between being _reactive_ (externally influenced) or _proactive_ (initiative-taking).

- If you’re externally influenced, your physical environment (like the weather), social environment (like how people treat you), and conditioning (like social norms) dictate how you feel and act.
- **If you’re initiative-taking, you mindfully choose your thoughts and actions** based on values you’ve chosen, cultivated, and internalized. You’re still subject to rain and your boss’s bad mood, but you suppress your reactive emotional impulses.

> **Taking Initiative Makes You Happy**
> 
> Taking initiative is empowering because it entails taking control of your actions and your responses to circumstances—and that can make you both happy and successful. In _[The Happiness Advantage](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/200789/the-happiness-advantage-by-shawn-achor/)_, positive psychology researcher Shawn Achor writes that feeling in control is one of the keys to happiness, and that happiness brings success (not the other way around, as many people mistakenly believe). Importantly, he clarifies that _[believing that you have control of your fate is more important](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage/principle-5)_ than how much control you actually have. With that in mind, he describes two approaches to life that are similar to Covey’s, but while Covey’s approach focuses on action, Achor’s are based on perception.
> 
> - People with an _external_ locus of control (like externally influenced people) blame their circumstances on external forces over which they have no control. They deny responsibility for failures as well as credit for successes, leaving them unconfident and unempowered.
>     
> - People with an _internal_ locus of control (like initiative-takers) believe that they have a direct impact on their futures. They learn from failures and try to improve for future situations.
>     
> 
> According to Achor, this sense of control contributes to increased motivation, lower stress, stronger relationships, improved communication and problem-solving, greater job satisfaction, and better physical health.

Covey makes a point to distinguish taking initiative from being blindly optimistic. (Shortform note: This difference plays out in [how people respond to systemic racial inequity](https://cdn.fedweb.org/fed-115/2/toxic%2520positivity%2520and%2520Why%2520It%25E2%2580%2599s%2520OK%2520To%2520Not%2520Be%2520OK%2520Right%2520Now.pdf), especially as the issue has been more broadly publicized and acknowledged in recent years.)

- **Initiative-takers accept difficult realities and determine how to resolve or make the most of them.** For example, in the movement for racial justice, initiative-takers celebrate progress as motivation to keep pushing forward and address the issues that still remain.
- Blind optimists minimize problems or deny that they exist entirely. For example, in relation to the movement for racial justice, blind optimists highlight increased awareness and activism as signals that the work is done (or nearly so), while glossing over persistent problems like [swelling membership in hate groups](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/white-nationalist-hate-groups-southern-poverty-law-center).

(Shortform note: Similar to blind optimism, [toxic positivity is an insistence on maintaining a positive outlook](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-toxic-positivity-5093958), and in doing so it disregards all painful and difficult emotions. While often well intended, this response causes shame and guilt for feeling bad, and it doesn’t allow people to feel and process painful emotions, which is necessary for growth.)

### How To

Covey offers six strategies for becoming proactive or taking initiative: two big-picture approaches and four actionable tips.

**1. Big Picture—Don’t worry about things you can’t affect.** Among the things you fret about, distinguish between concerns that are _beyond your control_ (like a housing market slump) and things _you can impact_ (like your upcoming mortgage payment). By definition, people who take initiative recognize and address the issues in front of them; they don’t spin their wheels on things they can’t affect, because it causes them unnecessary stress and reinforces feelings of victimization.

(Shortform note: Covey makes an important, implicit distinction between the things you can _affect_ and the things you can _control_. Taking initiative is about making a plan to address an issue, even when there’s no way to guarantee the outcome—for instance, you can help your child study for a test, but you can’t control how she performs on it. This suggests that this habit’s greater virtue is in the psychological relief of tackling an issue and putting it to bed, rather than the specific results of the action.)

**2. Actionable—Learn how to respond to problems you can’t control.** Empower yourself by recognizing whether and how you can affect the issues that worry you, and then responding appropriately. Covey lists three categories of concerns and the proactive responses to each:

Category 1) Problems related to your actions

- Action: Alter your behavior. Habits 1-3 focus on changing your actions through habits.

Category 2) Problems related to other people’s actions

- Action: Alter your interactions with those people, and you may be able to influence their actions. Habits 4-6 address this by improving how you connect and communicate with others.

> **Tips to Influence Other People’s Actions**
> 
> While Habits 4-6 will discuss how to influence others through an internal approach, **it also helps to have some actionable, externally oriented techniques for influencing others.** Marketing psychology professor Robert Cialdini outlined six psychological principles of persuasion in his bestselling 1984 book, _[Influence](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/influence-robert-b-cialdini?variant=32122116210722)_. The book is meant to be a warning about manipulative techniques used by professional persuaders, such as salespeople and politicians—but you can also read it as a playbook of strategies to influence people in _positive_ ways.
> 
> These are the six principles, and an example of how you could use them to influence someone to join a gym with you:
> 
> - **Reciprocity**—If you want someone to agree to a request, do something nice for them just because—and _then_ ask; they’ll likely feel compelled to [do you the favor of complying](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-2). For instance, treat your friend to a coffee, then broach the subject of joining the gym together.
>     
> - **Commitment/Consistency**—If you get someone to agree to something small, they will go out of their way to [maintain that commitment](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-3) if you make increasingly larger, related requests. For example, ask if they’ll go on a weekly walk with you to help you stay motivated. Then work up to pitching them on the gym membership.
>     
> - **Social Proof**—People assume that if many people are doing the same thing, that [must be the right thing](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-4) to do. Thus, to influence someone to do something, emphasize that many other people are already doing that action. For instance, tell them that your coworker and her friend belong to the same gym and do workouts together.
>     
> - **Liking**—Someone is more likely to comply with requests from [people they know and like](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-5), people who are associated with those they know and like, and people who they believe like _them_. For example, your odds are better asking a friend than a neighbor.
>     
> - **Authority**—People are more inclined to do something if an [expert or authority figure](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-6) tells them to. For instance, show your friend research proving that [people with workout buddies are more consistent](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/10032/) than solo exercisers.
>     
> - **Scarcity**—People find [rare and exclusive](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-7) things more appealing, so you can influence people to take your offer if you make it appear scarce or fleeting. For example, point out that you’re both so busy that partner workouts would be a rare opportunity to regularly spend time together.
>     

Category 3) Problems you can’t impact, like the weather and the past

- Action: Accept the unchangeable reality and make peace with it.

(Shortform note: In _[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Start-Living/Dale-Carnegie/9780671035976#:~:text=In%20this%20classic%20work%2C%20How,and%20make%20that%20lifetime%20happier!&text=%2DFind%20yourself%20and%20be%20yourself,else%20on%20earth%20like%20you!)_, Dale Carnegie provides tips for worrying less about what things you can’t affect. Some [strategies include engaging in the present](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living) moment, keeping busy with productive activities, reframing issues to recognize when you’re blowing something out of proportion, and practicing gratitude.)

**3. Actionable—Acknowledge and learn from your mistakes.** Mistakes and regrets fall into the third category from the previous tip: You can’t change or undo them. Thus, the empowered response is to admit, accept, and learn from your mistakes—and to do so as quickly as possible. Covey posits that the longer you go without learning from a mistake, the more likely you are to repeat it.

(Shortform note: Tony Robbins applies this principle on a subconscious level with a [habit-breaking technique he calls pattern disruption](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-3): When you catch yourself doing the action you want to change, abruptly interrupt it with something totally random (for example, stand up and shout something ridiculous). This prevents the signals in your brain from completing their usual course for that action; done consistently, these disruptions gradually weaken the brain wiring that triggers that behavior, which breaks the habit.)

> **Silicon Valley Celebrates Mistakes**
> 
> Mistakes—_making_ and _learning from_ them—are crucial to building knowledge, improving skills, and innovating. In Silicon Valley, failure is such a virtue in the tech industry that the unofficial mantra has become, “Fail fast, fail often” (though some say the emphasis on relentless ambition [drives many to exhaustion](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/28/silicon-valley-startup-failure-culture-success-myth)). There’s even an annual conference called [FailCon](http://thefailcon.com/about.html), where people in the industry swap stories about their failures.
> 
> Netflix CEO Reed Hastings writes about the [importance of talking about failures](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-6) in his book, _[No Rules Rules](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/606529/no-rules-rules-by-reed-hastings-and-erin-meyer/)_, where he describes the philosophies that helped the company adapt and thrive. He insists that when [leaders are transparent about their own mistakes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-5), it builds trust with their employees and encourages them to take risks, too.

**4. Big Picture—Decide how you see yourself.** Taking initiative involves creating your self-image, which impacts what you think, feel, and do, and it affects how you view others. In other words, your self-image determines everything from how you spend your time to whether you see others’ kindness as a weakness or a virtue. If you don’t mold your self-image, Covey posits that it’ll default to others’ opinions and actions toward you, which causes multiple problems:

1. It creates an inaccurate and disjointed self-understanding that leads you to behave dysfunctionally and ineffectively.
2. It makes your self-image unstable, because it’s subject to the flux of which outside influences you’re exposed to and what message they’re sending at any given time.
3. If others haven’t developed their _own_ self-images, their reactions toward you are based on projections of their own thoughts and fears (as are your reactions toward them).

Building on that, Covey says that people live up to their view of themselves, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Shortform note: Subsequent research bears this out: In her book, _[Mindset](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/44330/mindset-by-carol-s-dweck-phd/)_, psychologist and researcher Carol S. Dweck argues that the [course of your life can be determined](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindset/chapter-1) by whether you believe that your intelligence and abilities are unchangeable (a “fixed” mindset) or that they can evolve (a “growth” mindset).)

> **_Awaken the Giant Within_: Create Your Self-Image**
> 
> Robbins stresses that it’s important to recognize the self-image you’ve subconsciously adopted, then shift it to be more empowering. He says **you must regularly evaluate and adapt your identity to reflect the changes that come with age, experience, and new circumstances**.
> 
> Robbins suggests these [steps for reflecting on your current identity](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-15) and the identity you’d like to embody:
> 
> - **Relax.** Get into an open-minded state.
>     
> - **Repeatedly ask yourself, “Who am I?”** until you hit on something that resonates with you. Write down whatever comes to mind.
>     
> - **Reflect on the way you’ve just identified yourself.** Does your identity evoke pain or pleasure? If it carries pain, remember that you’ve _chosen_ to adopt this self-image, and you can choose to alter it.
>     
> - **Write a list of all of the qualities you want to embody.** If you possessed these traits, how would it affect how you talk, think, and feel?
>     
> - **Identify what kinds of actions, thoughts, and emotions** you want your new self-image to trigger.
>     
> - **Create a plan for embodying your new identity.** What behaviors would you need to adopt to be consistent with this self-image?
>     
> - **Commit yourself to this change.** Every day, use your new label to describe yourself—when you’re thinking and when you’re talking to others. Tell your friends and family about your new identity; if they begin to see you in this new light, you will eventually internalize your new identity.
>     

**5. Actionable—Watch your language.** Covey urges readers to be mindful of the words and phrases they use, which suggests that language _reflects_ and also _reinforces_ your approach to life. For example, consider the impact of how you talk about a job you don’t like:

- “I wish I didn’t have to work at a job I hate.” In reality, you made the choice to work at that job. Failing to acknowledge your ownership of that decision reinforces a feeling of victimization and a lack of control, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- “I’m working at a job I don’t like because it pays enough to help me pay off my debt, and I have a plan to get a better job when I’m debt-free.” This acknowledges that you dislike the job, while also recognizing why you made this decision.

> **_Awaken the Giant Within_: Transform Your Vocabulary**
> 
> To transform your vocabulary, Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) suggests being especially mindful of your habitual questions and metaphors.
> 
> - Your habitual questions are primarily [the questions you ask yourself](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-6), which trigger a sequence of thoughts on a subject. For instance, you’re struggling to master a new skill, and you ask yourself “Why can’t I get it?” This question is negatively framed, and it easily leads to thoughts like “I’m not good enough” and “I should give up.” By contrast, an empowering question like, “How can I alter my approach?” leads to more constructive thoughts.
>     
> - The metaphors you often use (such as, “Life is like a box of chocolates”) are particularly powerful because they evoke imagery that gives the phrase a bigger impact. [The vividness of metaphors makes them especially potent](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-7) in influencing your thoughts, moods, and actions. For example, describing high crime rates as a _beast_ of a problem that must be tamed has a more aggressive tone than saying that the issue is a social _ill_ that needs to be diagnosed and treated from the source.
>     

**6. Actionable—Make and keep commitments to yourself and others.** Taking initiative and addressing problems often requires goal-setting. Covey equates goals to commitments: You’re committing to taking steps to make concrete, proactive changes in your life. To grow this muscle and your overall effectiveness, Covey suggests a 30-day challenge in which you make small goals and take steps to achieve them. These commitments can be personal, at work, in your family, or in your relationships.

> **_Awaken the Giant Within_: Make More Decisions**
> 
> While Covey advises making commitments, Robbins emphasizes making decisions (a type of commitment) as fundamental to taking control of your life. In fact, decision-making is unavoidable: Although it can seem like avoiding a decision is the easy way out, Robbins asserts that **inaction is actually a decision to take a passive role and allow external factors to shape your life.**
> 
> Try these tips to embrace decision-making:
> 
> - **Build your decision-making muscles.** Practice making decisions at every opportunity, starting with small choices, like what to eat for dinner.
>     
> - **Don’t be afraid of making the wrong decision.** Mistakes are inevitable—accept and learn from them.
>     
> - **View decisions as commitments.** Making a decision to do something should eliminate any alternative in your mind. That commitment gives you clarity and focus.
>     
> - **Don’t avoid a decision because you don’t know how you’ll achieve it.** Trust that, if you’re truly committed to your decision, you’ll find a way to manifest it.
>     

### Going Deeper

As with all of the habits, taking initiative is a _simple_ concept, but not an _easy_ one to implement. Shifting your entire approach to life is a process—but it can help to have a thorough understanding of what that shift entails.

Covey asserts that adopting an initiative-taking mindset requires you to be in control of your thoughts and actions—and that means recognizing that you _have_ control of those things, which is a two-part process.

1. **Understand that you are not your thoughts, moods, or feelings.** According to Covey, these are merely your reactions to your interpretations of events and circumstances—and your interpretations are influenced by your perspective, which is malleable. Change your perspective, change how you interpret life, change how you feel. (Shortform note: Social psychologists Shelley Duval and Robert Wicklund’s [theory of objective self-awareness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S006526010860252X) recognizes people’s ability to observe their thoughts, actions, and experiences—which requires them to step back from thinking, doing, and engaging with them. Duval and Wicklund say objective self-awareness is a key tool in self-evaluation and self-improvement.)
2. **You are not your circumstances or your conditioning.** Society and popular culture often tell us that we are the products of our upbringing, environment, era, culture, and other external influences. However, this view is based on determinism, which says that you are who you are and do what you do because of your DNA (nature), your upbringing (nurture), or your environment. However, Covey writes that determinism ignores a key factor: Free will. (Shortform note: [The philosophical debate over determinism versus free will stretches back to ancient Greece](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/is-free-will-or-determinism-correct/). But instead of debating which is right, determine which is most relevant to your life: A defeatist attitude reflects an unhealthy sense of determinism, while overly high aspirations reflect an unhealthy sense of free will.)

> **So, Who Are You?**
> 
> If you’re not defined by your thoughts, moods, or feelings, conditions, or conditioning, then what makes you _you_? That depends on who you ask.
> 
> - Covey asserts that your core identity is defined by your character.
>     
> - According to the _[Handbook of Self and Identity](https://www.guilford.com/books/Handbook-of-Self-and-Identity/Leary-Tangney/9781462515370)_, [your identity encompasses traits](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/782/docs/handbook_of_self_and_identity_-_second_edition_-_ch._4_pp._69-104_38_pages.pdf), roles, relationships, and memberships in social groups. Identities can be oriented to the past (who you were), present (who you are), or future (who you hope or expect to be).
>     
> - In _[The Power of Now](https://www.namastepublishing.com/the-power-of-now)_, Eckhart Tolle similarly writes that [your identity is based on your job](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-now/principle-2), education, appearance, social status, possessions, personal and family history, beliefs, relationships, and memberships in various groups (including racial and political). However, Tolle clarifies that your identity is separate from the true essence of who you are, your true Being.
>     
> 
> It’s notable that none of these definitions claim that identity is fixed. Rather, identity is dynamic and evolving.

Covey warns that, **initially, taking initiative will be difficult**. Being proactive and taking initiative are actually natural human responses—but, just like a muscle, if you don’t practice these skills, they atrophy. If you’ve spent years blaming your problems on your circumstances and conditioning (for instance, “My parents raised me with this dysfunction”), it’ll take some deliberate practice to transition to an empowered perspective.

(Shortform note: In contrast to Covey’s advice to practice and hone proactivity as a skill, researchers Thomas S. Bateman and J. Michael Crant [developed the proactive personality scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229455940_The_Proactive_Component_of_Organizational_Behavior_A_Measure_and_Correlates) in 1993 based on the premise that people are naturally predisposed to be proactive or reactive. The scale measures people’s proactivity—the tendency to take action to affect external circumstances—so that managers can accommodate and optimize workers’ natural reactive or proactive inclinations, rather than trying to change them.)

Finally, **taking initiative means you have to take responsibility for your actions and their consequences.** Now that you know that you can choose your thoughts, feelings, and actions, Covey argues that you have to acknowledge that, explicitly or implicitly, you’ve chosen or allowed everything that’s happened in your life—good and bad.

> **Adopt an “Extreme Ownership” Mindset**
> 
> As a leader, being proactive requires taking full responsibility for your actions and decisions as well as your team’s. In _[Extreme Ownership](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250184726)_, former Navy SEALs and business consultants Jocko Willink and Leif Babin preach the virtues of an Extreme Ownership mindset, which entails:
> 
> - **[Being accountable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/part-i) for your team’s performance.** Instead of blaming others for mistakes, consider whether you provided adequate information, training, and support.
>     
> - **Maintaining and enforcing [high performance standards](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/chapter-2).** It’s your responsibility to help the team reach those standards and ensure that every member knows their role and understands [how they’re contributing](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/chapter-3) to the overall goal.
>     
> - **Checking your [ego](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/chapter-4).** You admit your mistakes, are open to constructive criticism, and put the team’s interests ahead of your own.
>     
> - **_[Giving credit](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/part-i)_ for successes to all of your team members and lower-level leaders**, instead of _taking_ the credit as their leader.
>     
> 
> Willink and Babin admit that, although the pillars of Extreme Ownership are simple, they are not easy—it’s not easy to take the fall for your team, to take feedback from a subordinate, or to own up to your failures. However, they insist that on the battlefield and in the office, personal accountability triggers a virtuous cycle: **When a leader has an attitude of Extreme Ownership, [it’s contagious](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/foreword), and everyone on the team starts prioritizing the team and its mission above their individual interests.**
