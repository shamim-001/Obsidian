## Chapter 3: Operating by Clear Principles

As we’ve already noted, Dalio’s early failures led to the belief that the best way to be right was for smart people to disagree with each other and explore each other’s reasoning. He never failed to point out when other people were mistaken, and he expected others to do the same to him. Unfortunately, some people found his candor abrasive and oppressive.

Dalio had never intended to humiliate people, and the pushback from those he treated with candor prompted a realization that people didn’t understand his logic and process of decision-making. **This friction kicked off his process of clarifying his principles in writing**, so that everyone across the company could understand his intentions and behavior, and so everyone had a common set of rules to treat each other respectfully.

But the Covid-19 pandemic has seen the [rise of new trends in people management](https://hbr.org/2021/04/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-manager-today), highlighting the need for empathetic managers and for relationships with employees to become _more_ emotional.

> 
> - **Have vulnerable conversations among peers.** Have one-on-one conversations with other managers about their specific challenges and circumstances. This allows you to practice empathy and gives you a safe place to determine the right amount of care to communicate.

> - **Provide support.** One fully remote company has a “team success partner” who helps foster trust within teams by facilitating conversations and helping new team members adjust.

> - **Rethink workloads and reporting lines.** Companies may have to re-evaluate workloads and make adjustments to enable managers to focus on building stronger relationships with fewer individuals.

### Leaving a Legacy Behind

After putting together and refining a clear set of principles, Dalio felt that he had a shareable blueprint for success. He thus turned his eye toward the next phase of his life: using his principles to help other people become successful even after he was gone. In particular, he focused on passing on the management of Bridgwater and passing on his principles to the world.

#### Passing On Management of Bridgewater

After codifying his work principles and turning them into algorithms that could automate management decisions, Dalio stepped down as CEO in 2011. He handed the reins to two co-CEOs, Greg Jensen and David McCormick. Jensen was a veteran at Bridgewater, having been there for 15 years; Dalio saw him as a son. After stepping down, Dalio continued serving as a co-CIO along with Jensen.

However, Dalio says that the management transition was rockier than expected, and the senior management was not succeeding in their roles. In 2016, the Bridgewater committees voted for Jensen to step down as co-CEO. Dalio notes this was personally painful given their history, but it was ultimately the best decision for the company. Dalio returned as co-CEO for a year to stabilize the company.

(Shortform note: In the book, Dalio refers to sensational media coverage of the transition. A _[Wall Street Journal article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/schism-at-the-top-of-worlds-largest-hedge-fund-1454695374)_ reported that both Jensen and Dalio had grievances with each other. Jensen was disappointed that Dalio was not being as hands-off as he had promised. Dalio was disappointed that Jensen had said something about him in a recorded meeting instead of saying it to his face—a gross violation of extreme transparency.)

Dalio realized that much of the difficulty in passing on Bridgewater’s management came from his unique status as a founder, having run Bridgewater for decades without any formal checks and balances. After he left, CEOs needed a governance system to hold them accountable, and to replace them if they weren’t capable. He noted how, with proper governance, no one person should be more powerful than the system.

(Shortform note: One expert says that a proper governance system requires [three mechanisms to help monitor and hold CEOs accountable](https://hbr.org/2020/03/how-companies-can-keep-ceo-behavior-in-check) for their behavior: 1) peer management among executives, 2) anonymous tip lines where employees can report concerns, and 3) a board of directors that reviews the CEO’s performance and behavior.)

#### Passing on His Principles

Dalio came to the realization that his purpose, as well as everyone else’s purpose, is to evolve through struggle, take important lessons from that struggle, and help others evolve as well. _Principles_ is his attempt to pass on the knowledge his experiences have taught him. He believes that his principles will resonate even after he’s gone, and he hopes that others can apply the same lessons to help them through their own struggles.

(Shortform note: With the desire to reach a wider audience and broaden the impact of his lessons, Dalio later released _Principles_ in more easily digestible and accessible formats. There’s _[Principles for Success](https://www.principles.com/principles-for-success/#play),_ an [animated series distilling the main ideas from the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9XGUpQZY38) into eight short episodes, as well as [a picture book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Principles-for-Success/Ray-Dalio/9781982147211) with the same title. Dalio says the picture book is simple enough for a six-year-old, though reviewers say [it’s more suited to older children](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/01/ray-dalio-principles-for-success/604930/).)
