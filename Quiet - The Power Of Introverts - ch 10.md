## Chapter 10: Introvert-Extrovert Communication

**Introverts and extroverts are often drawn to each other in the way that opposites seem to attract.** The two personality types can be complementary: one talks and the other listens; one is always ready for action, while the other wants to consider all the options; one schedules activities, while the other pays the bills.

But **problems can occur when a couple’s different personality types pull them in opposite directions**. The key to a lasting relationship is understanding and accepting the different ways that each communicates, resolves differences, and socializes.

Greg, an extrovert, and Emily, an introvert, are an example. They have a generally compatible relationship, but they reached an impasse over Friday night dinners, which Greg, a music promoter, has been hosting for years. Emily, a staff attorney for an art museum and a very private person, dreads them. When she gets home, she wants to unwind alone, not entertain a crowd. She volunteered to visit her sister on Friday nights as a compromise, but he doesn’t want to host the dinners by himself. Greg feels as though Emily is backing out of a key part of their marriage contract and he feels alone. He believes she’s anti-social; Emily feels defensive and wonders whether he’s right.

### A Key Difference

**People often wrongly believe that introverts are anti-social and extroverts are highly sociable.** In fact, the two personality types **both have a need for connection but they’re _differently social_.**

Introverts prefer to socialize with a few close friends and have meaningful, in-depth conversations. Extroverts need to be surrounded by a lot of people to feel as though they’re having a social impact. **Whether you’re an introvert or extrovert determines how many friends you have, but not whether you’re a good friend**. Researchers have found that introverts and extroverts are equally likely to be agreeable and friendly to other people—in other words, introverts aren’t anti-social.

### Miscommunicating

Being “differently social” leads to conflict when it means each person’s needs aren’t being met by the other. Typically, the introvert wants downtime and understanding at the same time as the extrovert wants his partner’s attention and company.

**Extroverts need to understand how desperately introverts need time to recover from a hectic day, and introverts need to understand that their silence can come across as rejection of their partners**.

Introverts and extroverts also have different ways of handling conflict or differences. Introverts are uncomfortable with emotions, so they become quiet and dispassionate when dealing with a conflict. Extroverts raise their voices and become emotional, especially as their partners seem to withdraw. To put it another way, **introverts try to avoid conflict while extroverts are comfortable with a confrontational style of disagreement**.

In the Emily-Greg example, the more she backs away, the angrier he gets. The way they disagree gets in the way of resolving the matter they disagree on—Greg’s Friday night dinner parties. Emily needs to learn that it’s OK to let Greg know she’s angry, so Greg doesn’t think she’s withdrawing. Meanwhile, Greg has to learn that venting his anger in an argument makes the situation worse. He needs to understand what needs are driving his anger and express them in a way that’s not a personal attack on Emily.

Emily needs to stop reacting to Greg’s anger defensively, as though she did something wrong. She also must acknowledge when Greg makes legitimate points and be more comfortable disagreeing forcefully.

### ‘Differently Social’

**For introverts, participating in a social event takes a significant mental toll**; it’s difficult for them to process information from multiple people simultaneously without feeling distracted and stressed. By contrast, extroverts are good at handling competing demands on their attention and therefore aren’t overwhelmed by the stimulation of a social event.

An interaction in a social setting involves many tasks, including:

- Interpreting what someone is saying
- Reading their facial expressions and body language
- Talking, listening, and responding
- Determining whether you’re being understood and well-received and if not, determining how to extricate yourself

Because of the mental demands, introverts tend to be quiet observers at parties or engage one-on-one. In individual conversations, introverts tend to talk about a problem and assume an advisor role, while extroverts talk about more light-hearted topics. This can result in a productive conversation—introverts appreciate extroverts’ focus on less-mentally taxing topics and extroverts appreciate the fact that introverts listen closely and ask questions.

For Emily and Greg, this means it’s natural for Emily to feel overwhelmed by social events, but she can enjoy conversations one-on-one. So they resolved their impasse by changing the format of their Friday get-togethers from sit-down dinners to buffets with people eating and conversing in small groups. They also agreed to host two parties a month instead of four.
