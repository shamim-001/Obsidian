## Chapter 7: Value—Embracing Failure

Most people are reluctant to fail or to admit failure. However, Manson says that **to succeed at something you first have to fail**, usually multiple times, so you can learn.

Improvement at anything is a result of many small failures. The more you’ve failed, the greater the scope of your success will be. Someone who is better at something than you are probably failed at it more times.

Manson believes that we don’t start trying to avoid failure until later in life, when we internalize messages that failure is bad from the education system and overly critical parents. The media’s focus on extraordinary successes, but not on the challenges leading up to them, also distorts our beliefs about success. **If you want to be successful at something you have to be willing to fail at it.**

> A popular quote by author and illustrator Stephen McCranie sums up this idea: “The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.” In other words, a master isn’t someone who never fails; on the contrary, it’s someone who has failed a great deal already and continues to grow through further failures.
> 
> Michael Jordan, a masterful basketball player by any measure, agrees: He credits his success on the basketball court to [the enormous number of failures](https://www.forbes.com/quotes/11194/) and mistakes that he suffered along the way.

Manson argues that **our fear of failure stems from having warped values.** For example, if your value is to make everyone like you, you’ll feel insecure; you’ll fear failing at your value because other people determine whether or not they like you. Therefore, a more constructive value would be to build good relations with others, which isn’t dependent on the actions of others.

> **Pride Makes Us Fear Failure**
> 
> Ryan Holiday’s _Ego Is the Enemy_ offers another theory about why we fear failure: [It’s a blow to our pride.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-3)
> 
> Holiday explains that, to an ego-driven person, failure seems like a direct insult or attack. Furthermore, when we encounter failure, ego naturally comes to the fore and takes over our emotions, which makes it hard for us to think and react rationally.
> 
> Thus, in order to protect ourselves from further “attacks,” we stop trying so that we no longer risk failure—which only serves to stifle growth and make defeat permanent.
> 
> To break out of that ego-driven mindset, Holiday suggests:
> 
> - **Turn “dead time” into alive time.** Dead time is when it feels like you can’t make any progress; perhaps you’re unemployed, stuck in the hospital, or even in prison. However, you can still use that time to better yourself, study and learn new things, or make preparations for your next period of “alive time.” Doing so requires that you stop thinking of yourself as a victim of circumstances, and take responsibility (**but not blame**) for your situation.
>     
> - **Let low points transform you.** A major setback or failure is a chance to learn a difficult truth, either about yourself (perhaps you don’t plan things out well enough) or about the world (perhaps there’s just not a market for your brilliant new product). Accepting that lesson and acting on it will allow you to do better in the future.
>     
> - **Examine your mistakes.** Look at the decisions and actions that led you to your current situation. Consider what drove those decisions, and how you might make different decisions to avoid this situation in the future.
>     
> - **Redefine success.** If you define success as popularity or material rewards, then a project that gets a lackluster reception will leave you frustrated, angry, and bitter. Try putting the focus on your own actions instead—if you completed your project and got it out into the world, then you succeeded. You can’t control what happens after that.
>     
> - **Cut your losses.** Because ego sees a failure as a personal attack, it wants to fight those failures to the bitter end, no matter what it costs you (money, reputation, friends, and so on). Instead, you should examine your failure honestly: can you fix it, and if so, is it worth the cost? If not, it’s time to let it go and move on to a new project.
>     
> - **Let go of hatred.** Your ego will try to find someone to blame—to hate—for your failure. However, hatred is counterproductive; it weighs you down with stress and shows you in a bad light, which makes others less likely to sympathize or cooperate with you.

### Pain Spurs Positive Change

Manson says that we need pain and suffering—including the pain of struggle and failure—in order to grow. **Pain shows us where we need to make changes**. It also makes us stronger, more compassionate, less entitled, and more appreciative of the positives in life.

When people feel sad or anxious, they usually want to get back to “normal” (feeling good) again as soon as possible. But Manson advises you to not try escaping pain so quickly; embrace the experience instead, and see what it can teach you.

> The examples of survivors of war and cancer shed light on another benefit of pain: **It can force us to look for meaning in our struggles and, consequently, live a more meaningful life.** Viktor Frankl found unique and powerful meaning through his experiences surviving Auschwitz, which he wrote about in _[Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/man-s-search-for-meaning/1-page-summary)_.
> 
> Many of Frankl’s fellow prisoners thought that surviving and getting home would give their suffering meaning, but Frankl disagreed—he didn’t like the thought that survival was the only meaning, because then their pain would have no meaning if they died. Instead, he found his own sense of meaning by reframing his _trials_ as _triumphs_; each hardship that he endured at Auschwitz was a personal victory.
> 
> Also, Frankl and others were able to resist their Nazi captors in small ways by protecting other prisoners, even when doing so meant they would be treated even more harshly than usual. Because that suffering helped others, it also had meaning.

### Just Start

People often get stuck on the question of _how_ to change—it seems complicated, and they don’t want to fail (or be perceived as a failure). For instance, they might ask, “How can I just drop out of school?” or, “How can I break up with my partner?”

According to Manson, there isn’t really a process; we just need to do it. **The solution to many problems in life is just taking a step that we already know is necessary.** It only seems daunting because we know that step will involve pain.

(Shortform note: One of the major topics in Aurelius’s _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/1-page-summary)_ is the difference between _pain_ and _harm_. For a Stoic like Aurelius, the only thing that can truly harm you is something that harms your character or your morality; in other words, something that **changes who you are.** However, pain—whether physical or emotional—is merely a distraction, and can be safely ignored. Therefore, Aurelius would agree with Manson that the best option is to simply do what needs to be done, and to calmly endure whatever pain it may cause.)

#### The Motivation Loop

Sometimes we wait for inspiration to motivate us, or we wait to be forced into action by a crisis. However, Manson argues that this approach is incorrect; **you should think of motivation as part of a loop, rather than part of a linear sequence.** Instead of moving from inspiration to motivation to action, you should constantly cycle between action, inspiration, and motivation.

He adds that **you can start doing something (taking action) regardless of whether you already know how to achieve your goal.** Once you get your brain moving, the solution will come to you; or, at the least, you’ll figure out exactly where you’re getting stuck.

If you start by doing something simple (such as writing down the numbers from a math problem), larger tasks (such as solving it) will seem easier. Also, doing something—anything—helps you to overcome procrastination.

> **An Example of “Just Starting”**
> 
> [Write every day](https://goinswriter.com/write-every-day/) is classic advice for aspiring writers, for exactly the reasons Manson outlines here:
> 
> - The act of writing helps overcome procrastination
>     
> - Once you start writing, you may find yourself motivated to continue
>     
> - Writing _anything_ helps conquer writer’s block—if you just start putting words on a page, you’ll often be able to work through your mental blocks.
>     
> 
> It doesn’t matter what you write each day, or how much—as Manson says, just do _something._ The same principle applies no matter what you’re trying to do: It doesn’t matter how you approach your task, or how much of it you accomplish, **just get started.**

#### Set a Low Bar, Then Clear It

You might be holding yourself back because you fear failure. Manson believes that this is another reason why “just do something” is a good starting point: **The bar is so low that failure is less of a concern.**

First of all, when your goal is simply to “do something,” _anything_ you do is an accomplishment. That small victory will then inspire you to do more. Second, the consequences of making a mistake will be minimal, so you’ll feel freer to mess up and learn from those mistakes.

(Shortform note: The Harvard Business Review writes that the single best motivator is [making progress at something meaningful.](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins) Even if that progress is minimal—for instance, even if your only goal was to “do something”—it will motivate you to keep working toward your goal.)
