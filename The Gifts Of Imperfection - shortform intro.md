## Shortform Introduction

Released in 2010, _The Gifts of Imperfection_ is a New York Times bestseller by researcher, speaker, and author Brené Brown. It’s one of many works by Brown on the themes of overcoming shame, embracing vulnerability, and learning to accept ourselves—flaws and all.

The “gifts” of imperfection referred to in the book’s title are **courage, connection, and compassion.** These are “gifts” of imperfection because they come about only when you’re willing to be vulnerable—you develop the courage to accept that you’re imperfect, you connect with other people because they empathize with your vulnerability, and you become compassionate with other people because you realize nobody’s perfect and forgive their imperfections.

In contrast, if we all lived perfect lives free from vulnerability, struggles, and mistakes, we’d never need to put these values into practice—meaning we’d never reap their benefits.

### About the Author

**Brené Brown is a writer, speaker, and researcher** who currently holds positions at the University of Houston and the University of Texas. The main focuses of her work are:

- Shame, and overcoming it
- The concept of “worthiness” (in simple terms, feelings of self-worth)
- The importance of being vulnerable
- Bravery, and its links to authenticity and vulnerability
- How to apply the principles of vulnerability and bravery to leadership

Brown has a slew of famous fans, from [Prince Harry](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a33792992/meghan-markle-prince-harry-brene-brown-adore-quote/) of the United Kingdom to [Melinda Gates](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-melinda-gates-on-the-moment-of-lift/). She gained prominence as a shame researcher and storyteller in 2010 after giving a [viral TEDxHouston talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Qm9cGRub0) on shame, vulnerability, and self-worth.

**Since 2010, Brown’s career has gone from strength to strength.** She’s released four more New York Times bestsellers, including _[Daring Greatly](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly)_, another book about vulnerability that raised her profile even further. It even attracted the attention of Oprah Winfrey, who’s subsequently [featured Brown on her Super Soul Sunday program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjUeTRcoJhs) multiple times.

Brown’s other books include:

- _[Rising Strong](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234211/rising-strong-by-brene-brown-phd-lmsw/)_

### The Book’s Publication

**Publisher:** [Hazelden Publishing](https://www.hazelden.org/store/welcome), partnered with [Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Gifts-of-Imperfection/Brene-Brown/9781592858491)

Published in the summer of 2010, _The Gifts of Imperfection_ closely followed Brené Brown’s lauded June 2010 TEDxHouston talk. **The book discusses similar topics to that talk: cultivating self-worth, combating shame, and living an authentic, “Wholehearted” life. _The Gifts of Imperfection_** wasn’t Brown’s first book: She’d previously published works on her research into shame and vulnerability. However, it became her most popular book to date.

In late 2020, Brown released a [10th-anniversary edition of The Gifts of Imperfection](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622519/the-gifts-of-imperfection-10th-anniversary-edition-by-brene-brown-phd-lmsw/9780593133583/), with a new foreword. (Note that this guide discusses the original edition of the book, not the 10th-anniversary re-release.)

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Upon its publication, _The Gifts of Imperfection_ topped the New York Times bestseller list and enjoyed sales in the millions. The book’s success may have been down to a shift in Brown’s method of expression: **Starting with _The Gifts of Imperfection,_ her work began to blend data and research with storytelling.** Specifically, Brown started to relate her own anecdotal experiences of the concepts she discussed, becoming more candid about her own struggles with shame and low self-worth. This proved to be a combination that resonated with many readers.

**In the years since _The Gifts of Imperfection_’s release, many readers have lauded the book as life-changing and affirming,** highlighting its simple principles for living a more fulfilling life. Furthermore, the book has been regularly praised in media outlets: Forbes described it as [one the best books of the 2010s](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbridges/2019/12/18/the-best-self-help-books-of-the-2010s/?sh=257c99116bce) in its genre. Likewise, nearly a decade after the book’s publication, the Evening Standard recommended it to readers as [a seminal work on improving your mental health](https://www.standard.co.uk/escapist/wellness/best-self-help-books-for-mental-health-a4144836.html).

The book is not without critics. Some online reviewers have bristled at what they see as Brown’s outsized focus on herself in _The Gifts of Imperfection_, and some believe that the book doesn’t contain enough practical advice for living Wholeheartedly and that its principles ring hollow as a consequence. Furthermore, some readers find that Brown covers the topics of shame and vulnerability much more exhaustively and effectively in her subsequent book _[Daring Greatly](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly)_.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_The Gifts of Imperfection_ begins with a primer on the concepts of worthiness, Wholehearted living (which can mean, simply, “living with a strong sense of self-worth”), and shame. **Brown introduces these concepts early because she refers to them throughout the book**: Therefore, a reader’s understanding of the book is much enhanced if she understands Brown’s definitions of these concepts early on.

Brown discusses these concepts through the introduction and first three chapters of the book. She sometimes jumps back and forth between discussing different concepts: For instance, she returns to defining worthiness in a chapter on shame. At times, this disjointedness can make the logic of these chapters difficult to follow.

After the primer, Brown introduces various strategies for living Wholeheartedly, dedicating a chapter to each strategy. Keeping a “one chapter per strategy” organization means the information on each strategy is self-contained. In some ways, this structure is effective—it means that if a reader wants to apply only three of the ten strategies, they can simply read three chapters of the book without missing any crucial information about these strategies.

However, a weakness of this siloed structure is that **it obscures the fact that many of the strategies are thematically similar and would work well applied in tandem.** For instance, the strategies of rejecting comparison and being authentic are _both_ rooted in helping the reader to love and accept themselves: a connection the reader may not make if they read about each strategy in isolation.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Brown’s approach to developing ideas in this book, as with her later books, is organic—she weaves together anecdotes, ideas on feeling worthy, and suggested actions without following a clear regimented structure. While this provides an engaging read, for readers who prefer logically straightforward books, it can be difficult to pull out the main ideas and relate them logically to each other.

Furthermore, as critics have noted, **Brown’s strategies for living Wholeheartedly are sometimes overly theoretical and light on practical advice.** For instance, they might state that you need to do something—like free yourself from societal expectations of how you _should_ behave—but not give advice on _how_ you might do it. Again, while these strategies are insightful and engaging to read about, their lack of detail may be frustrating for readers looking for step-by-step guidance on how to live Wholeheartedly.

### Our Approach in This Guide

**Structurally, this guide is split into two parts.** The first part discusses the theory behind the concepts of worthiness and shame, as discussed in the introduction and first three chapters of the book. We’ve reorganized and synthesized this information into two chapters to add clarity and eliminate the jumping between topics sometimes present in the book.

You’ll find information about Brown’s strategies for living Wholeheartedly in Part 2 of this guide. We’ve reorganized and grouped the strategies by theme to better show the connections between the ideas: As noted, many strategies have the same ultimate goal, such as increasing your overall happiness or helping you to accept yourself.

Brown's strategies aren't always directly related to worthiness or the gifts of imperfection, but her belief in the power of courage, compassion, and connection informs them all. Likewise, as previously noted, the strategies are sometimes more theoretical than practical. Wherever possible, we’ve added examples of practical steps you might take to implement the strategies, and we’ve linked them more explicitly to courage, connection, compassion, and Wholehearted living.
