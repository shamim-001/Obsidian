## 1-Page Summary

_Every_ one of your actions either reflects _traction_—moving in the direction of what you _actually_ want, helping you accomplish goals—or _distraction_—moving _away_ from what you actually want and your goals.

Today, with technology as an integral part of your world, it’s harder than ever to avoid the temptation of distraction. To keep moving in the right direction, you need to become _indistractable_—**able to understand and avoid your distractions and choose traction.**

There are four elements of the indistractablity model:

- Control your internal triggers.
- Build your schedule around your values.
- Reduce external triggers.
- Create precommitments.

We’ll discuss these four elements and then examine different ways you can bring indistractable habits to your workplace, your children, and your relationships.

### Part 1: Control Your Internal Triggers

**The root of distraction is _inside you_.** Humans are motivated by _freedom from discomfort—_mental and physical discomfort triggers you to find escapes.

- This may look like escaping difficult homework by scrolling social media or escaping marriage problems by building a farm on Animal Crossing.

**To get a handle on your distractions, you need to control their root cause—internal triggers.**

#### Change Your Thinking Around Your Discomfort

**Learning to control your internal triggers isn’t about trying not to think about them—this will just make you fixate on them more. It’s about _learning to change how you think about them._** Three exercises can help you examine and understand your internal triggers.

##### Exercise 1: Reflect on the Trigger

Rather than _reacting_ to triggers with distraction, take four steps to meaningfully _reflect_ on them and make more deliberate, traction-supporting choices.

1. **Identify the trigger.** When you’re about to switch over to a distracting activity, ask yourself: “What discomfort or feeling triggered me to do this?” Usually, you’ll find that the source is a negative emotion like anxiety, boredom, or lack of control.
2. **Note the trigger.** Keep a “distraction notebook” where you write down the details of your triggers—the time of day, where you were, your emotions, what you were doing when you felt distracted, and the distracting action you took. This step raises your awareness of your distraction patterns, helping you better control your actions in the future.
3. **Examine the feeling.** When you experience internal discomfort, commit to fully exploring all of your mental and physical feelings. Trying to suppress feelings often makes them stronger, but approaching them with curiosity helps them dissipate.
4. **Look out for transitions.** Distraction often happens when your brain is in the process of shifting from one activity to another. In these moments, tell yourself you’ll give in to the distraction _in 10 minutes_—usually, the urge passes by then.

##### Exercise 2: Reframe the Situation

Rethink the situation you’re in, finding a way to make it fun. **“Fun” doesn’t always feel _good_—it often feels like challenge, discovery, or most importantly, freedom from discomfort.** Making your situation engaging decreases internal triggers such as boredom and frustration, which curbs your urge to escape into distracting behaviors. This process has two parts:

1. **Dive deeper into the situation.** Break the situation down into its smallest elements and examine them. This helps you find new perspectives and challenges. For example, if you’re bored at your job in a coffee shop, closely examine each element of making a perfect latté—espresso type, cream content, steaming temperature, and so on.
2. **Create play.** Come up with different challenges. These should include _limitations_, which spark creativity and engagement. For example, if you have several essays to write, you might aim to write 3,000 words every day or set time limits to beat.

##### Exercise 3: Rethink Who You Are

Successfully becoming indistractable requires you to rethink two ideas about yourself: your willpower and your labels.

**Willpower:** Many people believe they have _finite_ willpower that becomes depleted. We often use this as an excuse for unhealthy behaviors—for example, you binge-watch Netflix after work because your “willpower is spent.” It’s important to think of your willpower as an _emotion_ that comes and goes rather than a _resource_ that runs out.

- If you think of willpower as a resource, you might give up on an overwhelming project because you “need a break.” On the other hand, if you think of willpower as an emotion, you find a way to manage it in that moment, such as completing a small or easy part of the project to get a boost of motivation.

**Labels:** Pay attention to the way you label yourself. When you label yourself a certain way—for example, “easily distracted” or “impulsive”—your behavior becomes more aligned with that label. This works in a positive way, too: Calling yourself “focused” or “indistractable” will prompt focused, indistractable behaviors.

### Part 2: Build Your Schedule Around Your Values

When your time isn’t structured, it’s all too easy to give it up to distractions that feel urgent or necessary. You get to the end of the day having done a lot, but none of the things you _meant_ to do. The natural solution to distraction-filled days is creating a schedule.

**Build your schedule around the three responsibilities that take up all of your time—you, your relationships, and your work—and your _values_ in each.** This allows you to visualize the balance among your responsibilities and better distinguish between traction and distraction. _Any behavior that happens at a time it’s not scheduled is a distraction, even if it feels productive._

In this section, we’ll examine how each of your three responsibilities should show up in your life, then discuss how to build and maintain an indistractable schedule.

#### Responsibility 1: You

If you’re suffering in the “you” department, your relationships and work will suffer, so it’s crucial that your personal values are scheduled first instead of squeezed around other activities. There are two parts to scheduling meaningful “you” time:

1. Schedule your basic needs such as sleeping, eating, and grooming. This helps you compare how you _should_ care for yourself with how you _actually_ care for yourself.
2. Think about who you want to be and the qualities you want to have, and what value-aligned activities you can schedule. For example, for your value of “mindfulness,” you might schedule 15 minutes of gratitude reflection in the morning. For your value of “staying healthy,” you might schedule an hour-long walk every morning.

#### Responsibility 2: Your Relationships

**Make time for _non-negotiable_ _commitments_ to your relationships with your family and friends every week.**

**Family:** Schedule regular indistractable time with your kids and partner. This time is a commitment, not something that can be pushed aside for another activity or interrupted by your email or social media.

- With your children, you might dedicate several device-free hours every Saturday afternoon doing an activity of their choosing.
- With your spouse, schedule deliberate time together to enjoy one another’s company, such as date nights or projects you want to work on.

**Friends:** Friendship is easily overshadowed by everyday wants and needs of your partner, children, and work. Without maintenance, your friendships easily dissipate. **Your plans with friends need to be _regular, set events_ in your schedule, not items on a to-do list.**

- For example, you might have a _weekly commitment_ to Sunday night drinks with your group of friends. Because this event happens every week as a group, members can occasionally miss it if they must but can count on seeing you again the next week.

#### Responsibility 3: Your Work

It’s crucial that the way you’re spending your time at work is well-aligned with what you want to do and who you want to be—otherwise, your workday can easily become disorganized and distracted. **A schedule helps your manager understand your distractions and see how your time is spent, and it makes for a better balance of values both _at work_ and _outside of work._**

**At work:** Your schedule gives your manager a clear idea of how you’re spending your time, which helps them contextualize problems such as late projects, a slump in productivity, and so on. With this information and an understanding of your values, they can suggest areas where you might reprioritize your tasks or cut out activities that aren’t serving your and their goals.

- For example, you want a promotion so you start taking on too many projects, making you increasingly frazzled and disorganized. When your manager understands your motivations and schedule, they can explain that spending more time on boosting your sales and less time on other projects would be more helpful to their goals and _won’t_ hurt your chances of promotion.

**Outside of work:** Your work-related schedule should note any _non-negotiable_ commitments that happen outside the workplace. This helps your manager know when it is and isn’t appropriate to ask you to do extra work or stay late.

- For example, if your weekly schedule shows Thursday nights blocked off for family, your manager understands that it’s _not_ reasonable or appropriate to ask you to stay late. However, if there are no non-negotiables on your Wednesday night schedule, your manager could reasonably ask to cut into that time if a project is truly urgent.

#### Build and Maintain an Indistractable Schedule

First, reflect on how your three responsibilities show up in your life and ask yourself three questions:

1. **“What is or isn’t working in my current schedule?”** Think about areas where you’re spending too much time or too little time.
2. **“What activities would better align me with my values?”** Think about parts of your day where you sacrifice your values in one area for another, and imagine how activities would look different if you stuck to _one_ responsibility at a time.
3. **“How much time do I want to allocate to each of my responsibilities?”** Think about the ways your schedule would allow you more time for some values and restrict others.

**Your answers to these questions reveal how your time will _ideally_ be spent. Next, build your ideal schedule using two essential elements of indistractable scheduling.**

##### Element 1: Timeboxing

Timeboxing is a way of organizing your calendar by dedicating blocks of time to specific activities. For example, you might timebox “read to kids” or “go through emails.” Timeboxing serves two purposes:

**1) It helps you balance your responsibilities.** Limiting the time you can spend on an activity stops you from working on it “until it’s done” as you might with tasks on a to-do list. This prevents you from letting one responsibility take up too much of your time at the expense of another.

**2) It helps you stick to what you’re _meant_ to be doing.** You decide _what_ you'll do and _when_ you’ll do it. This can stop small, easy tasks from distracting you from what you’re doing, because you know it will get done at another time.

- For example, in the middle of a difficult task, you might think, “I should return Sheila’s call now, before I forget.” Having a timeboxed schedule allows you to say, “I set time this afternoon for catching up on calls. I’ll add Sheila to that list.”

##### Element 2: No Blank Space

**You must schedule everything you do, because it’s the only way to accurately gauge your indistractability—that is, how often you do what you planned.** It doesn’t matter so much what your schedule looks like—it matters that you _stick to it_.

- For example, if you _plan_ to spend all morning on Reddit and actually do so, you were indistractable—doing what you planned to. On the other hand, if you planned to spend an hour watching television but answered a few work emails on your phone, you were distracted—not doing what you planned.

### Part 3: Reduce External Triggers

Our lives are inundated with external triggers that tempt us with an easy escape from internal discomfort. Deciding how to handle these triggers can be complicated—while most are distractions, _some_ can help you build traction.

- For example, you may have alarms that keep you on schedule or health apps that send reminders to drink water and stretch.

#### Manage Eight Common External Triggers

It’s up to you to decide which of your device’s triggers are useful and which are distracting. **Give each trigger an _honest_ assessment by asking yourself: Does this trigger serve me?** Then, adjust your devices so only the triggers that serve you can get your attention. There are eight common triggers that you should think about:

**1) Other people:** Create an obvious visual cue that tells other people that you’re not available for interruption. This can take any form that makes sense to you, such as a sign on top of your computer monitor with the message, “I’m focusing right now, please come back later” or a designated hat or pair of headphones that signify deep focus time.

**2) Email:** Checking your email and responding to messages may _feel_ productive, but it can take up _hours_ of your day. To reduce your overall email time, you have to manage two factors:

- **Time spent checking email:** First, make your inbox less tempting by making it predictable—unsubscribe from unimportant newsletters and services. Second, reduce the number of emails you receive—you can do this by setting aside in-person office hours or setting your emails to delay your responses by a few hours, slowing down the response cycle.
- **Time answering email:** Each time you check your inbox, reply to urgent emails, tag semi-urgent emails “Today,” and tag non-urgent emails “This week.” Set a daily timebox for processing “Today” emails and a weekly timebox for processing “This week” emails.

**3) Group chat:** Set three boundaries around your group chat use so that it shows up in your workday as a _tool for traction_, rather than invading your workday as a distraction.

- **Use it sparingly:** Use group chat like any other real-time communication—schedule time to check messages and reply. Set an away message and turn it off at the end of your group chat timebox.
- **Keep groups small:** Restrict chat invitees to two or three people who are most relevant to the issue and can contribute meaningfully.
- **Use it _only_ for quick, unimportant matters:** Discuss complicated and sensitive issues in person and leave your chat for simple confirmations or questions.

**4) Meetings:** Often, meetings are an excuse for someone to get _others_ to think about a problem they have. They interrupt employees’ schedules, and when attendees are stuck in a boring and unproductive echo chamber of the same ideas around an issue, they’ll be triggered toward distracted behaviors. You can make meetings more meaningful in two ways:

- **Require preparation:** The meeting organizer must send out a short agenda that details the problem and their best suggestion for a solution. Prior to the meeting, attendees should use this information to brainstorm solutions. These two steps ensure that everyone will hit the ground running at the meeting.
- **Ban devices:** Ask attendees to take notes with pen and paper, and set up a charging station by the door where they can plug in their devices.

**5) Smartphones:** Your smartphone is probably one of the most distracting things in your life, but it can also be a useful tool for a variety of tasks. Maximize your phone’s use as a tool for traction by first rearranging your apps and then adjusting their settings.

- **Rearrange your apps:** First, delete any apps that don’t serve you. Second, think about apps that are useful to you, but distracting. You can often _replace_ where you use these apps—for example, you might delete social media from your phone and use it exclusively on your computer. Last, rearrange your apps to remove clutter. Sort traction-supporting apps into a _Goals_ folder and a _Tools_ folder on your home screen, and move all other apps to the secondary screen.
- **Adjust the settings:** Think about which apps _deserve to grab your attention in any situation._ These apps—for example, your email and your messaging app—can keep their audio or visual notifications. Disable notifications for everything else.

**6) Desktop:** When you work against the background of a cluttered desktop, you encounter many visual reminders of questions to answer, tasks to complete, or ideas you wanted to research. These visual reminders of easy and interesting tasks can easily trigger you to escape from the discomfort of your work. **Combat this by sorting everything into out-of-sight folders.** This organizes your desktop so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and reduce your chances of being distracted by visual reminders.

**7) Articles:** When you come across an interesting article, you’ll often read it right away—at the expense of what you _should_ be doing—or you’ll keep it open in a browser tab so you don’t lose it, which clutters your workspace with tempting visual reminders. Articles are knowledge-boosting tools when used the right way—rather than cutting them out, change how and when you spend time on them.

- _Stop reading articles on your web browser._ Eyal recommends the browser extension and app Pocket for this step. Pocket will pull an article’s content and save it to the app on your phone, so you can read during your article timebox instead.

**8) Social media:** One of the most addictive features of social media is the “news feed,” where you can scroll through endless pictures and posts. Without the news feed, social media becomes less addictive and more in your control. There are two methods you can use:

- **Install browser extensions to control what you see:** You can find extensions to block almost anything that you find is keeping you stuck on social media—including the news feed, recommended videos, and comments.
- **Preload specific pages:** Skip over the homepage—where the news feed lives—by navigating directly to the page you want to access. To do this, save specific frequently visited or important URLs to your bookmarks bar so you’ll go directly to the part of the site you _want_ to be on. For example, instead of bookmarking Facebook.com, you might bookmark Facebook.com/messages or Facebook.com/[your business page]

### Part 4: Create Precommitments

The last part of the indistractable model focuses on locking yourself _into_ traction, rather than keeping distractions _out._ You accomplish this by using _precommitments_—choices you make while in an undistracted state that will help guide your behaviors when you’re tempted by distraction in the future. There are three types of precommitments that minimize the power of distraction: effort pacts, price pacts, and identity pacts.

#### Effort Pacts

**An effort pact is a precommitment that makes it _more difficult_ to do something _undesirable_.** This extra bit of difficulty gives you a moment to pause and ask yourself if the distraction is _really_ what you want to do. There are several ways you can create effort pacts for yourself.

- You can set apps, such as Self Control and Forest, to block certain websites when you need to focus.
- You can make yourself accountable to others—for example, asking a friend who works from home to come work in your home office so you both stay focused.

#### Price Pacts

**Price pacts attach money to your precommitment as an incentive to stick with what you said you would do.** If you do what you’re supposed to, you get to keep the money. If you don’t, you have to give up the money. This works especially well because people are much more motivated by _possible loss_ than they are by _possible gains_.

- For example, if you always skip over guitar practice, attach a $100 bill to your practice schedule and make a pact: If you miss a session, you must light the bill on fire. Every time you think about skipping practice, this tangible loss will help you rethink it.

#### Identity Pacts

**Identity pacts are a precommitment to the identity you want to have.** These pacts naturally align your behaviors with the desired identity.

- For example, make being indistractable an integral part of your identity by making a pact to describe yourself as someone who _is_ indistractable. For example, you’re not someone who _can’t_ tolerate distracting notifications—you’re someone who _doesn’t_ tolerate them.
