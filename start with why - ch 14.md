# Start With Why

## Chapter 14: Rethinking Competition

The common sentiment when it comes to building a business is that you have to make sure you’re beating the competition.

But the problem with that idea is that it makes you focus on what other companies are doing rather than steering your own. Instead of competing against others, it’s more effective to compete against yourself.

Here’s an anecdote of Ben, a high school cross-country track runner. He was the slowest on his team because Ben was born with cerebral palsy. Running was hard for Ben, but he pushed himself to finish each race. His WHY was to challenge himself to do better every race.

His teammates, all faster than he, support his WHY. After every race, they come back onto the track to run beside him to the finish line.

This story reminds us that **when you compete against yourself and no one else, other people--even those who others might identify as your competitors--want to help you.**

Companies and organizations that focus on WHY are more concerned with pushing their companies forward than going head-to-head with the competition. Starting with WHY makes you laser-focused on your own mission, not the missions of others.

And that leads Sinek to make his final point as he sums up the impact of starting with WHY. When you start with WHY:

- You make smarter decisions more quickly
- You foster optimism, creativity, and loyalty within your employees
- You create loyalty and trust with your customers
- You inspire others and become an innovator in your industry

In other words, starting with WHY can change more than just your own life and business. It can change the world.
