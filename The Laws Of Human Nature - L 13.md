## Law #13: People Are Compulsive According to Their Character

In the previous two laws, we learned two of the self-sabotaging traits (irrationality and inability to think long term) that everyone possesses. Now, we’ll look at the idiosyncratic characteristics we have that might sabotage us, starting with our compulsiveness.

**Our characters are at the core of our being and determine our actions,** even when we’re not consciously aware of them. **While we can shape our characters, we can’t change them.** This is why we tend to repeat the same mistakes, even when we try to do things differently, and this compulsiveness can be so strong that we believe that it’s fate or predisposition.

- For example, some people continually choose to date the same kind of unsuitable partner.

There are four layers to character, all of which determine our character traits. The first two are unconscious and we have to actively look for them to understand them.

**1. Genetics.** Our genes determine our moods, whether we’re introverted or extroverted, and potentially certain traits such as greediness, anxiety, or openness. (Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein believed that greedy infants were born that way.)

**2. Upbringing.** This layer of our character is formed by our relationships with our caregivers up until we’re four years old. During this time, we experienced intense emotions and were most susceptible to others’ influence. There are four relationships between children and mothers according to psychoanalyst and anthropologist John Bowlby, and these relationships often determine how our future relationships play out:

- Autonomous or free mothers protect their children but also give them independence.
- Dismissing mothers aren’t interested in their children. Their children often feel abandoned and as they grow, they avoid dependency and negative emotional situations.
- Ambivalent or enmeshed mothers are inconsistent—sometimes they’re distanced, sometimes they’re smothering. Their children sometimes take care of them, and the children grow up to find relationships anxiety-inducing and conflicting.
- Disorganized mothers are never satisfied with anything their children do. Their children sometimes end up with emotional problems.

**3. Habits.** As we grow up, when we make decisions, we create neuron patterns in our brains, and once we’ve established this neurological roadmap, we tend to keep following it.

**4. Masks.** As people discover our character flaws, we hide them by spinning them into something more positive or acting the opposite. This layer is what makes it hard to accurately assess other people’s characters.

- For example, an arrogant person might disguise their arrogance as self-confidence.

If these four influences are contradictory—for example, our genetics dispose us to be greedy but our parents raised us to be generous—our characters become contradictory too, often driving ambivalent or conflicting behavior.

In this law, we’ll look at how to manage toxic types. Then, we’ll look at how to control our own nature.

### Manage Toxic Types: Assess Character

Character must be your number-one consideration when choosing people to surround yourself with, such as your partner or boss. However, on the whole, **we’re not very good at assessing people’s characters because we tend to judge people on the obvious.** Often, we only see their reputation, position, or a myth they’ve created around themselves.

Additionally, **we like to believe that people are intelligent and decent, and we like to give them the benefit of the doubt.** If they’re successful, we like to believe they’re good (even though it’s very possible to become successful by taking advantage of others). If they hold certain positions—such as priest—we like to believe they have a moral code that fits the position’s (which is often not the case).

In reality, **some people have weak characters, and no matter how many positive traits a person might have, their character will overpower them.** This is because people with weak character can’t take criticism, so they can’t learn or change.

- For example, smart people might be good at their jobs, but if their character is weak, the moment something goes wrong, they’ll crack.

**People with strong character, however, _can_ learn from mistakes because they have enough self-worth to handle criticism.** Their character is more flexible and they can maintain their principles while also being open-minded. They keep their promises, can finish things, can prioritize global needs rather than their personal ones, and they’re patient.

There are two steps to accurately judging character:

#### Step #1: Study Behavior

The best way to determine people’s character is to study their behavior patterns. Research their past and pay attention to their current behavior, looking for repeated actions.

- For example, if someone has constantly missed deadlines in the past, they probably miss them in the present too.

Some situations are particularly useful when it comes to judging character:

**Situation #1: Positions of power.** When people don’t have power, they often hide their true natures, because these would impede their ability to get power. Once they have it, however, they can act more naturally. Power usually doesn’t change people—we had just never seen their true selves.

**Situation #2: The workplace.** Look at how people treat employees—if there’s a discrepancy between how someone presents herself and how she treats people, she may have a weak character.

**Situation #3: Daily life.** Often, in the workplace, people can channel their flaws into productive actions. Outside of that situation, however, their flaws don’t have an outlet and may be revealed.

- For example, if someone feels the need to win, at work, she can use this to motivate herself. While driving home from work, however, the need to win might more obviously show up in the fact that she hates other cars passing her.

**Situation #4: Small inconveniences.** People tend to react to small things the same way they’ll react to bigger things, so if someone reacts inappropriately to something small, they may have a weak character.

- For example, when Bob Haldeman, chief of Nixon’s staff, wanted a golf cart and there were none available, he became almost hysterical.

**Situation #5: Stressful moments.** It’s harder for people to disguise their true character when under pressure because they lose their self-control. The people who do behave appropriately in these moments have strong characters.

**Situation #6: Social circles.** People’s choice of friends and partners often reflects childhood relationships—for example, if someone didn’t get enough attention from her parents, she might look for a partner who will fill this role for her.

Note: There are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. Extroverts value external criteria such as clothes, food, and friends, and are preoccupied with what others think of them. Introverts, on the other hand, are more interested in their own thoughts and feelings and like to spend time alone or with just a few people. These two types of people don’t tend to understand each other and often think the other is inferior. (For example, introverts think extroverts are shallow, and extroverts think introverts are no fun.) Therefore, **if you’re trying to assess someone who’s a different type from you, consider if your assessment is being clouded by your dislike.**

**Situation #7: Tests.** Make a joke at someone’s expense, share gossip, give her a hard assignment, or criticize her to see how she reacts.

**Situation #8: Actions against their self-interest.** Some people’s characters are so compulsive that they can’t control their actions, even when they endanger themselves.

- For example, Cassius Severus was a lawyer and orator in ancient Rome. He gave speeches attacking prominent Romans, which eventually led to his banishment to Crete and the burning of his books. However, he kept writing speeches, and he insulted the locals so much they wanted to kill him. This behavior was obviously endangering his life, but he still couldn’t stop.

#### Step #2: Learn the Types

Everyone’s character is unique, but there are certain categories that people’s characters fit loosely into. Below we’ll cover some of the most dangerous ones. They’re dangerous because they’re often hard to spot and once you’re involved with them, it’s hard to escape. If no more specific directions are given on how to handle each type, you should avoid them.

**Type #1: Extreme perfectionists.** At first, perfectionists appear hardworking and dedicated. If they yell at people for their performance, this can be excused because they care about doing a job right, which is admirable.

In reality, however, these traits stem from a desire for control. Perfectionists can’t delegate or depend on others, and anything they lead is disorganized because they can’t create a reporting structure, as everything has to go through them. While initially successful, they often later suffer from health problems and burnout. They eventually fail and blame others.

Avoid working for them.

**Type #2: Exaggerated rebels.** At first, rebels appear exciting, and they appeal to everyone’s adolescent desire to be free of authority. Their humor can be mean, which can be excused as authenticity.

In reality, however, these traits come from a desire to feel superior. Likely, as children, their parents disappointed them and as a result, they can’t stand authority or criticism. In the past, they probably ended relationships on bad terms.

**Type #3: Oversensitives.** At first, these people seem thoughtful and sensitive, and often considerate, intelligent, and slightly sad.

In reality, however, they take everything personally. Their parents probably didn’t give them enough attention and care, and they’re constantly reminded of this when they encounter others. In the past, they probably ended many relationships, and they always think they were the victim. Eventually, they’ll get touchy and brooding.

Avoid oversensitives because they hold grudges and seek revenge.

**Type #4: Dramatics.** At first, these people seem exciting, humorous, energetic, and fun. In reality, however, they’re seeking attention. As children, they discovered that they had to exaggerate and dramatize their problems to maintain their parents’ attention. In the past, they had confrontations in relationships, and they always act like the victim.

Avoid getting enmeshed with dramatics. If you do get involved, it will be difficult to get out, because they’ll make you feel guilty.

**Type #5: Fountains of ideas.** At first, these types appear to have good ideas and you’ll be tempted to get on board and back their projects.

In reality, however, these people never complete projects. They want power and attention, but they’re scared to pursue their ideas because it takes effort, and they always give up. As children, they probably had disorganized parents and never want to be in a situation in which they’re judged again. In the past, they probably haven’t completed anything but will blame others for this.

Avoid getting involved with any of these type’s work

**Type #6: Free lovers.** At first, these types seem unrepressed and capable of appropriately mixing professional and personal boundaries.

In reality, however, they see all their relationships as sexual. As children, they were probably sexually abused, and sex becomes about validation. If they don’t get enough validation, they can get depressed.

**Type #7: Spoiled royalty.** At first, these people seem regal, calm, and confident.

In reality, however, they want to be pampered, and they’re good at getting others to do it. You might find yourself doing them favors. As children, their parents probably spoiled them and protected them, and they may have acted helpless to get this treatment. If they don’t get what they want, they behave childishly, such as by throwing a tantrum.

**Type #8: People pleasers.** At first, pleasers appear considerate, accommodating, and charming.

In reality, however, this niceness is a defense mechanism. As children, their parents were probably harsh and they acted deferential and polite to avoid judgment or punishment. These types usually resent having to act this way and are often passive-aggressive and good at lying. They may secretly wish to hurt whoever’s above them.

**Type #9: Rescuers.** At first, these people seem like godsends—you have a problem and they want to help you.

In reality, however, these types want to control you and tamp down your independence. As children, they often had to take on a caregiving role.

**Type #10: Moralizers.** At first, these people seem eloquent and moral because they’re angry at injustice.

In reality, however, they have no sense of nuance. They’re judgmental and everything is black and white. As children, they were sometimes punished for their desires, which resulted in repression. They secretly want whatever they speak out about against.

### Control Your Own Nature: Shape Character

You can’t change your character—no one can—but **you _can_ learn how your character determines your negative behavior, and then use this knowledge to transform weaknesses into strength and create new behavior patterns.**

To start assessing your character:

- Reflect on the specifics of each of your four layers of character (genetics, upbringing, habits, and masks).
- Assess your own character by studying your behavior using the same techniques you use to study others’.

Once you have a better sense of what your character is like, use the following strategies to improve it:

**Strategy #1: Notice when you start acting according to patterns.** You can’t consciously change your behavior until you’re aware of it.

**Strategy #2: Create new habits.** You can rewire your neurons and patterns by choosing to repeat behaviors that you want to have in your character. You might start with tolerance, resilience, or teamwork.

- For example, if you panic in stressful situations, put yourself in these situations to get used to them so you won't react so instinctively.

**Strategy #3: Point your character in a positive direction.** You’ve learned skills by repeating behaviors, and these skills can transfer to new behaviors.

- For example, if you’re a pleaser, you can use your social skills to gain power rather than defend yourself.

**Strategy #4: Spend time with people who do have a strong character** so their influence will rub off on you.

It takes effort to maintain the strong parts of our character—empathy, generosity, resilience—because being decent to others can lead them to take advantage of us. On the other hand, **it takes no effort to maintain weak parts of our character.** If we don’t make a conscious effort to strengthen our characters, over time, the weaker parts will win out and determine our behavior.

> **Extended Example: Howard Hughes**
> 
> Howard Hughes is an example of someone with a weak character who was good at hiding it. He had a terrible track record and made the same mistakes over and over, but people kept giving him second chances because they weren’t aware of this law.
> 
> Like everyone’s, Hughes’s character started to develop in childhood. His mother smothered him and his father expected him to represent the family name, and between the two of them, they ruled his life. **He was so scared of letting his parents down that he acted very obedient but secretly hated depending on them.**
> 
> When Hughes was 19, his parents died and he finally had control over himself. He inherited his father’s lucrative tool-making company and used the money to make movies and start an airline company.
> 
> However, **all of these ventures failed in the exact same way—Hughes was a control freak and micromanaged everything.** Projects were always behind schedule, over budget, and weak, because Hughes wasn’t an expert in either of these industries and **refused to take advice or ideas from anyone because he couldn’t bear to be dependent.**
> 
> For example, in 1942, the Defense Department commissioned Hughes’s company to produce transport and photo-reconnaissance planes. Hughes meddled in the engineers’ and general managers’ work and several of them quit.
> 
> Two years later, the project was so behind that the military forced Hughes to find a new general manager. He asked Charles Perelle, a superstar in aircraft production. **Perelle initially didn’t want the job because he’d heard Hughes was difficult to work with, but when he met Hughes in person, this didn’t appear to be the case at all—Hughes was good at hiding his character.** Hughes acted humble and promised to give Perelle authority. Hughes said that he needed Perelle’s help and that the previous problems had been caused by executives, not Hughes. Perelle took the job but quickly realized he’d been taken in. He quit less than a year later and the company never completed even a single reconnaissance plane.
> 
> In 1965, Hughes bid for another military contract. Even though his company had a terrible record, his publicity campaign and low price convinced the army to award him the job. Exactly the same thing happened—the project fell behind and didn’t produce. **Hughes hadn’t learned anything from the previous contract and hadn’t changed at all.**
