## Introduction

Nearly everyone is pursuing the “holy grail” of success. But while we all want to succeed, most people fall short. In _The 10X Rule_, entrepreneur and motivational speaker Grant Cardone argues that people don’t succeed because:

1) **They misunderstand what it takes to be successful**. People often mistakenly think success is a matter of having money, connections, talent, the right education, the right personality, getting lucky breaks, being in the right business or industry, or being in the right place at the right time. But these don’t guarantee success.

**Only the 10X Rule—setting extreme goals and taking extreme action to meet them—guarantees success and, unlike the above criteria, it’s available to everyone**.

2) **People don’t approach success the right way**. First, **they don’t set high enough goals due to “average” thinking**. They don’t want to be unrealistic or risk failure, so they set seemingly attainable goals, yet still fall short.

Cardone himself fell into this trap. He has achieved success by many measures: as a best-selling author, a popular motivational speaker, investor, and entrepreneur (his companies have annual revenue of over $100 million). However, he writes that his biggest regret is that he wasted time by not setting extraordinary goals personally and professionally, right from the beginning of his working life.

Second, people fail to reach their goals because **they underestimate what it will take to reach them and don’t apply enough effort**. Again, this is average thinking—they assume that by putting in a “reasonable” amount of effort they’ll succeed.

### The 10X Solution

Instead of coming from external factors (money or connections), success comes from having the right mindset. Cardone argues you need to scale up your thinking and actions by a factor of 10. The 10X Rule or formula for success is: set goals that are 10 times bigger than the average, then work 10 times harder than average to achieve them. Cardone refers to the latter as taking “massive” action. **It takes extraordinary thinking and effort to achieve extraordinary success.**

Setting 10X goals and taking extraordinary steps to achieve them isn’t taught in business schools. But anyone who achieves extraordinary success—whether a CEO, philanthropist, entrepreneur, politician, or athlete—follows the 10X rule, whether they realize it or not. What successful athlete hasn’t devoted extraordinary effort to training and practice?

The 10 Rule can be applied to any personal or professional goal, whether it’s having an extraordinary marriage, starting a hugely successful business, or making $10 million.

#### Benefits

Besides reaching your goals, living by the 10X standard provides other benefits, including a sense of purpose, increased self-confidence, a way to overcome fears and procrastination, renewed energy, and greater satisfaction. Further, it’s a way to stand out from the crowd, fulfill your potential, and create the life you want.

In business, a think big/act big mindset enables you to overcome obstacles such as competition, economic downturns, disruptions, and client resistance.

Operating at a 10X level is a discipline for approaching and reaching all goals, a way of life, and the way to handle all tasks and projects.
