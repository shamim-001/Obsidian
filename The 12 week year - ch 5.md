## Chapter 5: Discipline 4—Measure Your Progress

You gain valuable information about how to execute more effectively when you keep track of your execution progress over the week. Use a weekly scorecard to track your stats for how well you’re performing. With these data, you can make informed decisions about how to adjust your plan or process to attain better results. **Without an objective measure of execution, you can’t know whether you’re doing what is necessary to meet your 12-week goal and future vision.**

Some believe that keeping score is demoralizing because you’re forced to recognize failure. But the opposite is actually true. You can focus on what you’re doing right, rather than wrong, to boost your confidence and willpower. Statistical data are devoid of emotion. All you see is the raw facts of your outcomes.

### How to Track Performance

**To effectively track your execution progress, use two different measures: lag indicators and lead indicators.** Lag indicators measure results, such as dollars earned, pounds shed, sales made, and pages written. Lead indicators measure the steps taken to achieve those results, such as marketing tactics, exercise routine, number of sales calls, and hours spent writing. You need to balance your focus between each type of indicator to gain an accurate measure of success.

Most people naturally keep track of their lag indicators. It’s human nature to measure how well you’re meeting your desired goals. Whereas you _do_ want to keep an eye on your overall progress, you will grow more when you focus your measurements on your lead indicators.

Measure your lead indicators each week by calculating the percentage of tasks completed. Divide the number of tasks completed with the number intended to get the resulting percentage of success.

- For instance, if you were supposed to complete two tasks a day during the five-day work week, you should have 10 tasks completed by the end of the week. If you only did three, your operational percentage would be 30%.

The next step is to determine whether this low rate of success is due to a faulty plan or poor execution. You should be able to look at your weekly plan to see if the strategies and tactics predicted actually combine to achieve the result at Week 12. If not, change your strategies. However, **you can only know whether your plan is faulty if you’ve sincerely put effort into optimal execution**. If you look at your plan and know you didn’t attempt to execute to the best of your ability, the blame is on you, not the plan, and you can adjust your behavior accordingly for better execution.

Far too often, people abandon the plan without an earnest effort to execute it. They think their failure to achieve means the plan is not good, but they’re not being honest about their behavior. You’ll feel discomfort when you start to score your execution because it’s human nature to avoid negative feedback. When you aren’t brave enough to admit your flaws, you scapegoat the mission to protect your self-esteem. This process is so common, researchers call it _productive tension_.

Productive tension occurs when you know you aren’t living up to your potential. You feel guilty about your inactivity, so you take the easy way out by quitting. However, **productive tension can be a useful tool if you embrace the discomfort. You can use the tension to spur resilience and commit to working harder.**

#### View Your Scores As Feedback

You don’t have to strive for perfection in your weekly execution. If you execute 85% of the time, you'll still be on track to achieve the outcomes you want. Even if you only execute 65% of the time, you can still succeed if you stick to the plan and commit to executing a little more every day. But you must know how effective or ineffective your current execution is before you can adjust your plan of attack.

**The more you perform these measures, the faster you’ll be able to judge your progress and make the necessary adjustments.** Keep the measures for results and execution separate. You may not have lost any weight during one week, but if you succeeded in completing 100% of your tasks, you’re still making progress. When you’re deeper into your 12-week plan and notice you still aren’t losing enough weight to make your goal, you may need to adjust your plan. But you won’t know where the problem lies if you don’t execute faithfully.

It won’t be easy to adjust your thinking to view execution as a measure of success instead of results. But your future is created by what you do today. **If you want to know where you’re going, you have to be able to see where your actions are leading you.** Your scorecard helps you predict your future by measuring your current progress.

#### Business Scorecards

You want your company to perform well and produce at a high level, and keeping scorecards for your team’s progress is a good way to ensure it is. **The focus on lead indicators is even more vital in a workplace setting because it helps you understand whether your team is working efficiently and where someone is falling behind.**

Too often, bosses want to judge their employees’ performance on end results. When they fail to meet your expectations, you both feel disappointed. And a disappointed workforce is a demotivated workforce. Avoid these negative consequences by remembering that measures are merely feedback on the success of the process, not a tool to punish your workers.

When you look at lead indicators, you’ll get a clear picture of how hard your team is working to achieve their personal and team-related goals. If they’re scoring high and the plan is legitimate, you know successful results are sure to follow. If they’re scoring high and not achieving the desired results, your expectations for the 12 weeks may be too high or missing important steps. Use the scorecard to evaluate your system, as well as individual performance.

Another good aspect of the scorecard is it will show you who may need support for the tasks they’re accountable for. If one of your employees scores below 60% two weeks in a row, don’t jump to the conclusion that they aren’t working hard enough. They may just be overloaded and require assistance to accomplish their weekly tasks.

#### Common Errors and Tips for Success

Avoid these common errors related to measures:

- **You think scoring your progress is unimportant.** If you don’t know how well you’re performing, you won’t know how likely you are to achieve your goal.
- **You don’t schedule time for measures.** Scoring your week should happen at the end of the week or Monday morning.
- **You stop scoring when you experience bad results.** Avoid thinking of low scores as failures. Think of them as feedback that indicates a required change.

Use these tips to strengthen your measuring practice:

- **Review your scores with others.** Knowing you will process your progress during your WAM can motivate you to achieve higher scores.
- **Strive to improve weekly.** Don’t settle for 60% or 85%. Push yourself to achieve more. If you’re at 100%, don’t be afraid to adjust your plan to achieve more.
- **Be optimistic about high scores.** Even if you score less than 100%, if you’re succeeding in finishing most of your tasks, stay positive. You’re still on an upward trajectory. If too many weeks go by without improvement, reevaluate your plan.
- **Embrace the data.** The scores will indicate whether your plan and execution are where they need to be. If they aren’t, don’t be afraid to look at the truth of what needs to change.
