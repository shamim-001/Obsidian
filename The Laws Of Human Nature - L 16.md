## Law #16: People Want to Avoid Thinking About Death

In the previous law, we looked at what people want. Now, we’ll look at what people _don’t_ want—to die.

Humans are the only animal aware of our inevitable mortality, and while this awareness and cognitive ability are why we’re top of the food chain, they also make us sad. **To avoid this sadness, we try to think about anything _but_ death. Most people take this so far that they don’t even think about being _alive_**—instead, their minds circle the same few fears, irritations, and hopes, and they only give their surroundings half of their attention.

**Interestingly, the more we try to repress death, the less alive we feel, which is known as the paradoxical death effect.** This is because when we avoid thinking about death or desensitize ourselves, our anxiety about it strengthens. **To avoid feeling this anxiety, we try to make our life more controllable by doing less,** dulling our psyche with an addiction, avoiding new things so we can’t fail at them, and avoiding spending time with people because they’re unpredictable. All these responses actually make our life more death-like—isolated and unchanging.

Similarly, **when we don’t repress death, we actually feel more alive. An awareness of death makes us pay more attention to the people and world around us.** We realize nothing is permanent.

- For example, when writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky was imprisoned, one day he was taken to St. Petersburg and told he’d be executed in just a few minutes. Dostoyevsky’s senses and emotions went into overdrive—he noticed rays of light and people’s expressions. At the last minute, he was given hard labor instead of being executed. His new awareness of life stayed with him for the rest of his days.

**In the past, humans dealt with death by inventing an afterlife and rituals associated with it.** Moving from life to an afterlife couldn’t stop the physical pain of death, of the pain of separation from loved ones, but it did make death less frightening and even gave it some pluses.

- (Shortform example: The stereotypical image of heaven was a peaceful, bright place where you could be reunited with those who had died before you.)

**Today, however, now that we know more about science, it’s harder for people to believe in an afterlife.** We’ve come up with a few new strategies to make death less painful:

- **We’ve hidden it.** In the past, people regularly died in public places or their homes, and many people had witnessed the death of someone else. Today, in some parts of the world, death is relegated to hospitals, and most people have never seen someone die.
- **We’ve made it cartoonish.** In films and video games, action scenes are full of death, but it’s not taken seriously.
- **We worship youth.** We avoid old things because they remind us of how short life is. Instead, we focus on what’s new.
- **We worship technology.** Some people like to believe technology and advances in medical science will help us defeat death.

In this law, we’ll look at how to control our own nature by learning some strategies to feel more alive.

### Control Your Own Nature: Feel More Alive

There are five strategies to becoming more aware of death (and therefore feeling more alive):

**Strategy #1: Make death more concrete.** We tend to think of death as an abstraction, but this makes us feel less physically connected to the world. To make death more visceral:

- Think about how as you age, your cells die.
- Meditate on death by paying attention to how your body feels just before you fall asleep when your consciousness level is changing, like it would in death.
- Imagine your death in vivid detail. Think about how and where it will happen.
- Imagine you’re just about to die, and you have only minutes to take in the world one final time.
- Imagine the world continuing on without you.
- Don’t try to avoid feeling scared or sad as you do the above exercises. Having emotions is part of being alive.

**Strategy #2: Become aware that other people die too.** Imagine the people you know dying and how it would change your life. Try to imagine their fear and vulnerability to death. Then, think about how in a few hundred years, everyone who was alive at the same time as you will be dead. This will remind you that you have something in common with everyone—mortality—and it will help you be more empathetic and drive you to connect with people. It will also help you deal with even the evilest people—they’re mortal too.

- For example, in 1665, there was a plague in London, and it made everyone more empathetic towards each other because everyone was equally vulnerable.

**Strategy #3: Acknowledge that time is limited.** When we avoid thinking about death, it’s easy to procrastinate, because it feels like we have unlimited time. In reality, we don’t, and we usually have less time than we think we will. Learn to make use of time by giving yourself deadlines for goals. When you have time pressure, your body will release adrenaline, energy, and concentration.

Don’t try to evade thinking of death by thinking there’s no point in doing anything. You won’t be happy if you feel like you’ve wasted your life.

**Strategy #4: Don’t shy away from pain and difficulty in life.** Our tendency to do this is rooted in our fear of death, and as we learned, hiding from death dulls our lives. When you encounter something painful or some adversity, don’t focus on the discomfort, focus on how the experience will teach you something and make you stronger.

- For example, if you get sick, see your recovery as an opportunity for reflection.

This strategy requires practice—you won’t immediately be able to see the good in the bad.

**Strategy #5: Embrace the Sublime.** Death is the ultimate manifestation of something we can’t understand. Try to access the Sublime by:

- Looking up at night and contemplating the vastness of the universe
- Thinking about the unlikeliness of life developing on Earth
- Reflecting on how unlikely human evolution was
- Thinking about how unlikely your own birth was
- Considering what humans can’t perceive. For example, some animals have stronger senses than we do.
- Reading scientific journals
- Traveling to unfamiliar locations, especially landscapes where humanity feels small, such as giant mountains or desserts

> **Extended Example: Mary Flannery O’Connor**
> 
> Mary Flannery O’Connor and her father both had lupus erythematosus, a life-threatening disease that ultimately killed them both. Flannery felt the presence of death throughout her life and used it to live more fully.
> 
> When Flannery was 10, she wrote vignettes describing her relatives. Her mother wasn’t impressed—she wanted her daughter to be a southern lady. Her father, however, loved the stories and professed that his daughter would grow up to be a famous writer.
> 
> **When Flannery’s father died, she experienced the concreteness of death and threw herself into writing.** She moved away from her mother and went to the University of Iowa to study writing. Her stories were well-received and after she graduated, she started working on her first novel.
> 
> One day she fell ill and was ultimately diagnosed with lupus. **She’d seen how quickly the disease had killed her father and realized she might not have much time left. This motivated her to pay attention to every experience she had, which made her feel more alive.** She was also motivated to keep writing—she realized that without the threat of imminent death, people were selfish, unaware, and complacent. She could use her words to enlighten them.
> 
> No matter how sick she felt, she kept writing until she died at the age of 39.
