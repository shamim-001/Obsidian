## 1-Page Summary

Achieving your life’s purpose and becoming the best version of yourself often seems impossible. However, in _The Mountain Is You_, Brianna Wiest explains that the only thing holding you back is yourself—and your self-sabotaging behaviors. Wiest explains that you self-sabotage when you desire a change—in yourself, your lifestyle, your career, and so on—but are too afraid to act. This internal conflict creates a barrier between who you are and who you want to be. To overcome this barrier, achieve your life purpose, and become your ideal self, Wiest says you must identify your self-sabotaging behaviors and their root causes, learn how to overcome them, and develop principles that will help you achieve your goals.

Wiest is a best-selling author and poet who focuses on spirituality, mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and self-improvement. Wiest holds a degree in professional writing with a minor in gender studies, and she has published titles including _[101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think](https://shortform.com/app/book/101-essays-that-will-change-the-way-you-think)_ and _[The Truth About Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-About-Everything-Brianna-Wiest/dp/1945796014/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1TULV13M5FTEW&keywords=the+truth+about+everything&qid=1662742675&s=books&sprefix=the+truth+about+everything%2Cstripbooks%2C95&sr=1-1)_. In both, Wiest uses her life experiences to provide advice on how to handle challenges, find meaning, and take control of your emotions and circumstances.

This guide explains how to achieve your life purpose and become your ideal self by understanding Wiest’s concept of self-sabotage and her methods to uproot it at its source. We’ll start by discussing what self-sabotage is and explaining why it happens. Next, we’ll explore how you can identify your self-sabotaging behaviors and their root causes. Finally, we’ll explain how to overcome self-sabotage and develop principles that will allow you to achieve your life purpose and become your ideal self.

In addition, we’ll supplement Wiest’s advice with alternative perspectives from other self-help books such as _[Awaken The Giant Within](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within)_ by Tony Robbins, _[The Success Principles](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles)_ by Jack Canfield, and _[The Willpower Instinct](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct)_ by Kelly McGonigal.

### What Is Self-Sabotage?

Wiest argues that **self-sabotaging behaviors are the _avoidance tactics_ your brain develops in an attempt to protect you from your fears**. For example, if you fear being alone, you may avoid this fear with the self-sabotaging tactic of staying in abusive relationships. If you fear failure, you may avoid this fear with the self-sabotaging tactic of never applying for the jobs you truly want. If you fear being disliked, you may avoid this fear with the self-sabotaging tactic of pretending to be someone you’re not.

(Shortform note: While Wiest argues that self-sabotage is your mind’s effort to help you avoid situations you're afraid of, [Jocko Willink has a harsher view on the matter](https://shortform.com/app/book/discipline-equals-freedom#decide-to-succeed). In _[Discipline Equals Freedom](https://shortform.com/app/book/discipline-equals-freedom),_ Willink agrees that self-sabotaging behaviors stem from fears; however, he believes that these fears aren’t of _situations_, as Wiest says, but rather are fears of _the work it takes to succeed_ in those situations. So, in Willink’s view, self-sabotage is a form of laziness and a way to avoid doing scary, painful, or hard work.)

**You tend to develop unhealthy fears when you lack the mental or emotional skills (ME skills) necessary to handle difficult situations**—Wiest refers to ME skills as _emotional intelligence_ and _mental strength_. For example, you may fear being alone if you lack the ME skills to independently satisfy your emotional needs. You may fear failure if you lack the ME skill of self-confidence. You may fear being disliked if you lack the ME skill of self-love and consequently desire external validation.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Wiest that self-sabotage often happens when your emotions hijack your thinking and you lack the emotional intelligence skills (or ME skills) necessary to regain control. They add that [the skills most helpful in avoiding emotional hijacking and self-sabotage are empathy, awareness, and compassion](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/enlightened-living/201711/self-sabotaging-emotional-intelligence#:~:text=Before%20we%20find,and%20self%2Dcompassion.). These skills are important in overcoming self-sabotage because they allow us to accurately understand ourselves and others.)

**Wiest explains that ME skill deficiencies usually develop because of life circumstances that prevented you from developing certain skills.** For example, having an absent parent who denied you love and encouragement might have prevented you from developing ME skills like self-confidence and self-love. You’re then likely to fear being in a similar situation in future relationships.

(Shortform note: In _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within)_, Tony Robbins cites another way that an emotionally unhealthy past can lead to self-sabotaging behavior. He elaborates that [negative past experiences can create what he calls neuro-associations that influence how you perceive and behave in future situations.](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-2#beware-of-neuro-associations-that-reinforce-negative-behaviors) For instance, if you had an absent parent, you might associate intimate relationships with negative emotions because the relationship with your parent caused you such emotional pain. Consequently, you might engage in the self-sabotaging behavior of pushing away people who love you because you’re afraid you’ll end up getting hurt in the end.)

**Wiest argues that the tactics you use to avoid your fears are self-sabotaging because they’re holding you back in life**. You use them as a crutch to avoid difficult situations rather than developing the ME skills required to face them, which you must do to grow and achieve your life purpose.

(Shortform note: In _[The Obstacle Is the Way](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-obstacle-is-the-way)_, Ryan Holiday agrees that facing and overcoming difficult situations is necessary for personal growth. However, Holiday goes a step further, arguing that you should _actively embrace_ difficult situations as a means of developing as a person—difficult situations teach us things that we may not have otherwise discovered. He notes that tragedies [shake us out of our comfort zone, reveal new choices in life that may not have been possible before, uncover our strengths, and help us find meaning in life](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-obstacle-is-the-way/part-3#when-tragedy-strikes-act). And failure—the process of trial and error—[is the most effective way to learn](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-obstacle-is-the-way/part-3#when-tragedy-strikes-act). Failure prompts you to look at things in a new light and develop ideas you may not have otherwise thought of.)

#### How to Overcome Self-Sabotage

Wiest explains that there are two steps to overcoming self-sabotage:

1. **Identify your self-sabotaging behaviors and the ME deficiencies that they stem from.** This will help you pinpoint the barriers preventing you from success.
2. **Overcome your self-sabotaging behaviors** by improving your ME skills, identifying your life purpose and ideal self, and taking active steps toward achieving these goals.

Next, we’ll examine each step in detail.

### Step #1: Identify Your Self-Sabotaging Behaviors and Their Root Causes

Wiest explains that **you can determine whether you’re self-sabotaging by identifying everything in your life that you’re unhappy about and want to change.** Then, create a list of the behaviors that are preventing you from making those changes—these behaviors are self-sabotage.

For example, imagine you’re unhappy at your current job and want to become a writer instead. However, you aren’t making progress because you haven’t started looking for a writing job—your self-sabotaging behavior is procrastination. Write this down.

(Shortform note: While Wiest recommends uncovering self-sabotaging behaviors by identifying the things you _don’t_ want and the barriers preventing you from changing, [Tony Robbins advocates focusing on what you do want instead](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-3#step-1-decide-on-your-destination-and-identify-your-obstacles). In _[Awaken The Giant Within](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within),_ Robbins says that having a clear idea of what you want will positively frame your efforts to overcome obstacles (such as self-sabotage), provide you with intrinsic motivation, and consequently make you more likely to succeed.)

This exercise may not uncover all of your self-sabotaging behaviors, so Wiest suggests that you also consider whether any of the following situations are recurring themes in your life. If so, the behaviors that perpetuate them are probably forms of self-sabotage.

1. You lack the commitment necessary to achieve goals or nurture relationships.
2. You engage in relationships that negatively influence you.
3. You rely on others or society to guide your actions and goals.
4. You rarely engage with people, information, or situations that feel “new.”

Add the self-sabotaging behaviors that contribute these themes to your list. **Then, take accountability for your self-sabotage by acknowledging that _you_ have the power to change your situation**—even if that means leaving relationships, jobs, or security, or changing the way you think or act.

> **Overcome Self-Sabotage by Identifying and Owning Your Unhealthy Behaviors**
> 
> Experts agree that comparing your behavioral patterns to common forms of self-sabotage, as Wiest recommends, is a great way to identify your self-sabotaging behaviors. They add [a few related, but more specific symptoms of self-sabotage](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-stop-self-sabotaging#:~:text=Symptoms%20of%20self%2Dsabotage):
> 
> - You tend to be controlling or a micromanager.
>     
> - You pick fights or start conflicts with colleagues or loved ones.
>     
> - Your goals are either too high or too low.
>     
> - You tend to “overdo it” by engaging in activities like substance abuse or overspending.
>     
> - You never stand up for yourself or speak your mind.
>     
> 
> Once you identify your self-sabotaging behaviors, experts agree with Wiest that the next step is to acknowledge your agency in the issue. They add to Wiest’s advice, noting [a few techniques to help you take ownership of your self-sabotage](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-stop-self-sabotaging#:~:text=1.%20Develop%20self,make%20a%20change.). First, write down your bad behaviors in a journal and keep track of _when_ you engage in them so that you can recognize your patterns. Second, make a plan of action pinpointing the specific changes you can make to stop your self-sabotaging behaviors. These activities will force you to acknowledge that your bad behaviors are patterns that you have the ability to stop.

> **Addiction and Self-Sabotage**
> 
> While Wiest very briefly mentions addiction and substance abuse in _The Mountain Is You_, she doesn’t include it as a primary symptom of self-sabotage. On the other hand, psychologists and mental health experts emphasize that addiction is an extremely prevalent and serious form of self-sabotage because addicts are often blind to the downsides of their addictions. This is because addiction is a chemical reaction—[getting a “fix” of the preferred substance releases endorphins and directly stimulates or mimics neurotransmitters that trigger a dopamine release in our brains](https://www.12keysrehab.com/the-psychological-link-between-addiction-self-destructive-behavior/#:~:text=People%20engage%20in,circuit%20over%20time). This makes us feel happy and allows us to escape negative thoughts, feelings, and situations.
> 
> When determining whether or not you may be struggling with addiction, note that addiction pertains to more than just substances like drugs or alcohol. In _[The Willpower Instinct](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct),_ Kelly McGonigal explains that [you can become addicted to anything that gives you a dopamine rush](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct/chapter-5#when-dopamine-leads-to-addiction)—technology, gambling, sex, or even other people.
> 
> To recognize signs of addiction, [consider whether you identify with any of the following statements](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hope-relationships/201411/6-signs-youre-addicted-something):
> 
> - The substance or activity has become important to your life and daily routines—without it, you feel out of control, anxious, sad, or uncomfortable.
>     
> - You’re progressively spending more time engaging with the substance or activity.
>     
> - The substance or activity has taken time away from other areas of your life.
>     
> 
> If you identify with any of the statements above, you might be struggling with addiction: Add it to the list of self-sabotaging behaviors you’ve compiled in this section. To get help, get in touch with the [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline).

#### How to Identify Your Mental-Emotional Deficiencies

Once you’ve identified your self-sabotaging behaviors, Wiest explains that **the next step in overcoming them is to identify the ME deficiencies they stem from.** As we discussed previously, every self-sabotaging behavior is designed to protect you from a certain fear, and these fears develop because we lack the ME skills to effectively face them. Once we pinpoint which skills we lack, we can learn them and lessen the need to self-sabotage.

**First, analyze each of the self-sabotaging behaviors on your list (from Step #1) and think about _why_ you do them. Each _why_ will be one of your fears.** For example, if you procrastinate taking action toward your goals, it may be because you fear failure. If you spend time with people who make you feel bad, it may be because you fear being alone. If you have trouble committing to things, it may be because you’re afraid to trust your decisions.

(Shortform note: In _[The Success Principles](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles),_ Jack Canfield adds another level to Wiest's advice, explaining that [when recording your fears, you should specifically record what you’re afraid of doing rather than just what you’re afraid of](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principles-15-16#technique-1-reframe-your-fear). For example, rather than recording that you’re afraid of being alone, be more specific by including what you’re afraid of _doing_ alone. Maybe you’re afraid of _living_ alone, or maybe you’re afraid of _managing your emotions_ alone. Adding these details when recording your fears will give you more context to identify the ME deficiencies that underlie them, which Wiest recommends doing in the next step.)

**Next, identify your ME deficiencies by connecting each of your fears to a mental or emotional skill that you would need to overcome it**. For example, to overcome a fear of failure, you need to improve your self-confidence. To overcome a fear of being alone, you need to improve your ability to be independent—that might mean working on self-confidence, self-love, and other skills to fulfill your emotional needs independently. To overcome a fear of commitment, you need to work on self-trust and self-confidence.

(Shortform note: In _[The Magic of Thinking Big](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-magic-of-thinking-big),_ David J. Schwartz cites four skills that allow you to face your fears. First is the ability to [maintain a positive mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-magic-of-thinking-big/chapter-3#think-positively) and let go of negative past experiences. Second is the ability to [understand other people](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-magic-of-thinking-big/chapter-3#gain-a-better-understanding-of-other-people). Third is the ability to [understand and act according to your conscience](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-magic-of-thinking-big/chapter-3#make-moral-right-choices). And fourth is the ability to [think and act confidently, even if you don’t feel confident](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-magic-of-thinking-big/chapter-3#act-confidently-even-if-you-dont-feel-like-it)—essentially, fake it ‘til you make it. If you let your fears control your behavior and engage in self-sabotage, it’s likely that you’re missing one or more of these skills.)

### Step #2: Strengthen Your Mental and Emotional Skills

Once you’ve identified your self-sabotaging behaviors and the ME deficits that are causing them, Wiest explains that you must take active, and sometimes uncomfortable, steps to overcome them. First, you must strengthen your ME skills by learning how to follow your instincts and effectively interpret, process, and respond to your emotions. Once you’ve improved your ME skills, you must identify your ideal self and life purpose and take steps to achieve them.

#### Action #1: Follow Your Intuition and Release Your Fears

**Wiest explains that you can overcome your self-sabotaging behaviors by listening to your intuition (your instinctive understanding of how to act) and differentiating it from your fears**. This is because while _self-sabotaging_ behaviors are driven by your _fears_, _productive_ behaviors are often driven by your _intuition_. If you learn how to get in touch with your intuition, you can consciously override self-sabotaging behaviors and replace them with actions that bring improvement and progress toward goals.

(Shortform note: Wiest argues that listening to your fears is bad because it causes self-sabotage. However, in _[The 10x Rule](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule),_ Grant Cardone argues that [listening to your fears is beneficial and might even help you get in touch with your intuition](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/chapters-16-18-21#1-fear-of-risk). Fear can be an indication that you’re on the right track because you’re pushing yourself outside your comfort zone—an activity Wiest also says is necessary for growth. Additionally, the more you get comfortable understanding and facing your fears, the more you will be able to grow.)

**To follow your intuition rather than your fears, recognize when your thoughts or feelings are driving you toward a certain action or behavior, and take a moment to reflect**. Wiest explains that we’re often subconsciously driven by our fears because they’re louder and more prominent than our intuition. Fears tend to manifest when we think we know what will happen in the future, worry about something, panic, have an emotional reaction like getting angry or jealous, or feel pumped up with adrenaline. If you find yourself being driven to act based on any of these factors, take a step back and acknowledge that your fears are pushing you toward self-sabotage.

(Shortform note: In _[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection)_, Brené Brown adds that our fears often override our intuition because we’re programmed to avoid _uncertainty_. Rather than following our subtle gut instincts blindly, we try to predict outcomes and choose the path of least resistance. Adding to Wiest’s recommendation, Brown notes that [we can avoid following our fears and focus more on our intuition by having faith](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-2#barriers-to-using-intuition)_—_adopting the mindset that things will work out fine in the end, even if you’re uncertain of how that will happen.)

Wiest notes that in contrast to fear, intuition is the quiet, internal responses you get when you’re in tune with the _present moment_—they often manifest as moments of clarity (for example, determining that you enjoy or dislike something) or peacefulness (feeling content, happy, or inspired). **To get in touch with your intuition, focus on the present moment rather than the future—reflect on how you’re _currently_ feeling and respond to what’s _currently_ happening**.

For instance, if you feel content and peaceful doing something, you should probably find a way to engage in that activity more often—recognizing what brings you contentment may even lead to uncovering your life purpose. Likewise, if you don’t feel content or happy doing something, you should probably spend _less_ time engaging in that activity.

(Shortform note: In _[10% Happier](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier)_, Dan Harris refers to the idea of focusing on the present moment and your current feelings as _mindfulness._ He elaborates that [another important component of mindfulness is emotional detachment](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier/part-2#mindfulness)—acknowledging feelings and sensations but not letting them control you. This will allow you to understand the emotions that you’re feeling without permitting them to hijack your mind and cause self-sabotage.)

#### Action #2: Effectively Interpret and Respond to Your Emotions

To listen to your instincts rather than your fears and avoid self-sabotage, Wiest explains that you must also learn how to effectively interpret and respond to your emotions—emotions (like anxiety or discomfort) are what trigger fears that cause self-sabotage. When you’re able to recognize the emotions you’re feeling and understand _why_ you’re feeling them, you’ll be better equipped to determine whether they stem from intuition (the gut feeling that something’s right or wrong) or fear.

**Wiest explains that the first step in accurately interpreting your emotions is to identify what you’re feeling and accept it**. For example, if you’re feeling angry, acknowledge the emotion and let yourself feel it. If you try to stifle your emotions rather than letting them run their course, they’ll just build up inside you, make you feel worse, and contribute to more self-sabotaging behaviors.

(Shortform note: Wiest advises identifying the emotion you’re feeling so you can accept it, but she doesn’t provide specific advice on how to do this. Many people struggle to identify how they’re feeling or misidentify their emotions due to a poor emotional vocabulary. To accurately label the emotions you’re feeling so you can effectively process them, [experts recommend first broadening your emotional vocabulary](https://hbr.org/2016/11/3-ways-to-better-understand-your-emotions). This includes learning how to differentiate an emotion like anger from other emotions like frustration or contempt. Second, the next time you feel a strong emotion, rate how strongly you’re feeling it from one to 10. Finally, make it a habit to write out the emotions you’re feeling. This will help you identify them more easily in the future.)

**Next, interpret your emotions by pinpointing _why_ you’re feeling them.** Emotions usually indicate an action we need to take. Wiest explains that anger usually indicates what we care about and encourages us to act to achieve it. Jealousy usually indicates something that we want but don’t have. Resentment usually indicates that someone hasn’t lived up to our expectations of them. Regret usually indicates that we missed out on something in the past.

**Once you uncover _why_ you’re feeling an emotion, you can consciously determine the best course of action** to avoid self-sabotage and instead take actions that will improve your life. For example, if you feel resentment toward someone, you can have a productive discussion with them about the problem rather than acting poorly and ruining your relationship. If you’re feeling regret after passing up a job opportunity, you can use that feeling to guide you by seeking out job opportunities that are similar to the one you passed up.

> **How to Interpret Emotions**
> 
> Determining _why_ you feel a certain way and _what to do_ about it can be difficult. However, in _[Awaken The Giant Within](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within),_ Tony Robbins presents [a concrete method to help you do just that](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-8#step-3-decode-your-emotion).
> 
> Robbins explains that when you feel a negative emotion, you need to either _change the beliefs_ that are causing you to feel that way, or _change your actions_ to avoid the negative feeling in the future. To determine what needs to be done, ask yourself: What do I _want to feel_ _instead_? What _belief_ is causing me to feel this way? What can I do to _resolve or prevent_ what’s causing this pain? What can I _learn_ from this situation?
> 
> For example, when another driver cuts you off, you may feel angry due to a _belief_ that their behavior is caused by selfishness. However, you might _prevent_ feeling and acting out of anger by _instead_ considering the other driver’s needs and leaving extra room for them to merge into your lane. A potential _lesson_ is that empathy and attention to others’ needs can preempt anger for both you and others.

#### Action #3: Identify and Take Steps Toward Your Ideal Life

Once you’re able to overcome self-sabotage, follow your instincts, and effectively respond to your emotions, Wiest explains that you’ll have the ME skills necessary to become your ideal self and achieve your life purpose. There are two major steps in this process: First, identify your goal—ask yourself what you want to do in life and who you want to be. Second, develop principles that will guide your actions in life and help you take the steps necessary to achieve your purpose.

##### Step #1: Identify Your Purpose and Your Ideal Self

Wiest explains that you should strive for two goals: achieving your life purpose and becoming your ideal self. Your _life purpose_ isn’t just a hobby or the job you do. Rather, it’s the point where your talents and passions converge with the needs of society—an activity that inspires and fulfills you but that’s also something that you can make a career out of. Your _ideal self_ is the most powerful, successful, happiest, and productive version of yourself that you can imagine. Wiest offers two exercises to help you identify your life purpose and ideal self.

**To identify your life purpose, Wiest recommends answering the following questions**: What are you willing to work for, be challenged by, or even feel pain over? If you weren’t concerned about others’ approval, what would you choose as a career or aspire to do? What skills or activities come naturally to you or do you find yourself regularly engaging in? What would you do on an ideal day without considering work or obligations? What skills, values, or traits do you want to be remembered by?

> **How to Identify Your Purpose in Life**
> 
> In _[The Success Principles](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles),_ Jack Canfield agrees that defining your life purpose is crucial to feeling fulfilled and [adds a few steps to Wiest’s recommendations](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principles-2-3):
> 
> - List the times in your life that you’ve felt most happy. Determine whether these instances share any characteristics and how you might be able to make a career from them.
>     
> - Write down 30 things you want to _be,_ 30 things you want to _have_, and 30 things you want to _do_ before you die. This step also might help you answer Wiest’s last question—what do you want your legacy to be?
>     
> - Brainstorm what areas of your life are important to you and what you want them to look like so you can make sure your life purpose accomplishes them. For example, what kind of relationships do you want, and what characteristics they should include? You can consider other areas like finances, leisure, or community as well.
>     

**To identify your ideal self, Wiest recommends engaging in a meditation with your future self.** First, find a quiet place, sit down with a pen and paper, take deep breaths to center yourself, and release any fears or negative emotions. When you feel totally relaxed, visualize the highest version of yourself sitting across from you. Then, take note of how they look, behave, speak, and communicate through their body language; what are they wearing, how are they feeling, and what do they do every day?

Next, listen to the advice that this future self wants to give you, even if it’s something you might disagree with at first. This advice should be uplifting, caring, and helpful. Now, imagine the particular aspects of this person’s life that allow them to live their purpose—where they’re living, what job they’re doing, the relationships they have, their daily tasks, their habits, and so on. Finally, imagine them giving you the key to that life—their life, routines, behaviors, and skills are now yours. This final step will put you in an “action” mindset that encourages you to enact the tasks and behaviors necessary to become your ideal self.

> **The “Future Self” Method**
> 
> Wiest’s recommendation to identify your ideal self by meditating with, observing, and seeking guidance from your future self is gaining traction in spiritual communities and the field of psychology. However, as this trend gains popularity, people are realizing that the “future self” method might be flawed—[it can cause you to develop disempowering behaviors and ways of thinking about your current self](https://hbr.org/2021/09/stop-striving-to-be-your-future-self).
> 
> In _The Willpower Instinct,_ Kelly McGonigal adds scientific context to this argument, explaining that the “future self” method can be ineffective because [people are often imagining a stranger when they envision their “future self,” not simply a better version of themselves](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct/chapter-7#future-you-is-still-you). This causes a disconnect between your self-image and the image you’ve imagined. And contrary to Wiest’s claims, McGonigal says that this disconnect makes you more likely to engage in behaviors and impulses that are immediately gratifying, like self-sabotage, and less likely to engage in activities that will help you become your ideal self in the long term.
> 
> To _avoid_ this disconnect and make your future self an inspiring and motivating force, [McGonigal adds two steps to the “future self” method that Wiest discusses](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct/chapter-7#willpower-hack-say-hello-to-your-future-self):
> 
> - **Use the imagined emotions of your future self to guide your present actions.** When you’re facing a real-life decision—like whether you should go for a run or hang out at home and watch TV—imagine how your future self would _feel_ about your choice. Would they feel empowered or thankful? Or, would they feel disappointed and regretful?
>     
> - **Write to your future self.** McGonigal recommends using sites such as [futureme.org](https://www.futureme.org/) to write emails to your future self and schedule them to be sent on future dates. This way, you can hold yourself accountable for following through on the activities and behaviors that help you become the ideal self you’ve envisioned.
>     

##### Step #2: Develop Life Rules To Achieve Your Purpose and Ideal Self

Once you’ve identified your life purpose and the person you’d like to become, **Wiest says you must create _life rules_ that will help you achieve and maintain these goals**—Wiest calls these _principles**.**_ These rules should represent personal commitments that you believe in and that will shape your life in the long term. For example, if you have a life rule to cut ties with people who regularly make you feel bad, you’ll live a life surrounded by positive people who encourage you to be your best self.

**Life rules will help you make hard decisions and face difficult or triggering situations, encourage you to continually pursue your goals, and help you overcome barriers** that may cause you to stray from your intended path. Living by your rules will ensure that you’re happy and always progressing toward the best version of yourself.

> **Principles Aren’t Always Accurate**
> 
> While Wiest suggests creating personal principles to guide your actions and decisions, [the philosophy of moral particularism suggests that this might not always be the best way to promote personal growth](https://iep.utm.edu/morlpat/). The theory asserts that **moral principles are too black and white to accurately guide your actions in every situation**. While the theory specifically refers to _moral_ principles, the same fundamental assertion can be applied to Wiest’s claim about _personal_ principles—sometimes, there will be delicate nuances and heterogeneous situations where the _best_ decision is _not_ the one that your principles would suggest.
> 
> Consider the personal principle mentioned above—to cut ties with people who make you feel bad so you can live a happy life surrounded by positive people. While this might be a great principle to live by in _most_ situations, following it blindly might actually hinder personal growth.
> 
> For example, maybe you feel bad around someone because of your own underlying belief, _not_ because of something they’re doing wrong. In this situation, cutting ties with that person might be a form of self-sabotage that lets you perpetuate the negative underlying belief and causes further negative emotions in the future. Instead of following your principle to cut ties with them, maybe you should confront the underlying belief that’s causing you to feel negative emotions around them.
> 
> Ultimately, moral particularism suggests that you should consider all the nuances of a situation before _blindly_ following your principles.

To create life rules, Wiest recommends making a list of things you _value_ and genuinely care about, a list of _feelings_ you want to experience regularly, and a list of things that make you uncomfortable or produce _anxiety_. Create rules that will help you reach the things you value, experience the feelings you desire, and manage the things that cause you anxiety.

For example, if you value travel, want to feel inspired throughout your life, and feel anxiety around financial issues, you can create the following life rule: “I’ll set aside money every month so I’ll be able to travel without having to worry about the financial burden of it. I’ll spend an hour each week researching travel locations to gain inspiration and foster my love for travel.”

Ultimately, Wiest explains that **these rules should pertain to every area of your life that’s important _to you_**—this can be anything from finances to skill development, relationships, career building, communication, and so on. Most principles won’t result in immediate gratification, but over time, they’ll pave the path to achieving your life purpose and ideal self.

> **How to Create Principles That Work**
> 
> In _[Dare to Lead](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, Brené Brown agrees with Wiest that your principles must be based on the things that are _most_ important to you and applied to all areas of your life. [She adds a few recommendations that can supplement Wiest’s advice and make your principles more effective and actionable](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-2#choosing-practicing-your-values):
> 
> After creating your list of values, Brown advises choosing the _two_ most important items on your list and prioritizing them. This is necessary because having too many values may restrict your ability to commit to the things that are _most_ important. You can apply this to Wiest’s recommendations by prioritizing the two items on your list of _values_ that will most effectively produce the _feelings_ and manage the _anxieties_ you’ve compiled on your other lists. Then, make sure these two values are represented in each principle you create.
> 
> Next, Brown recommends making these principles actionable by brainstorming how you can implement them in real life. First, compile a list of actions that support your principles—for example, if your principle is to set aside money to travel, you could read about investing or create a travel fund. Next, compile a list of behaviors that go against your principles and that you should therefore avoid—for example, don’t pull from your travel fund to pay for weekend getaways if your real priority is a month-long trip abroad. Finally, recall a moment when you lived by your principle. This will motivate you and remind you what to strive for.
