## Chapter 9.3: People Management: How to Train, Evaluate, and Sort People

Once you’ve hired the right people, you can focus your attention on training them, evaluating how they’re doing, and deciding what to do with them based on their performance. Dalio gives specific tips for each part of the process.

### Training

The training process can tell you if the person you hired is a good fit for the job. Dalio says it generally takes six to 12 months to get to know an employee’s strengths and weaknesses and their preferences for work. Here are his guidelines for making the most out of this period:

#### Be Clear on What the Expectation of Work Is

That way, you can hold people accountable and gauge whether they performed poorly due to _unclear_ or _unmet_ expectations.

(Shortform note: If you’re chronically unhappy with your team’s performance and believe that they don’t meet your expectations, [evaluate whether your expectations are unreasonable](https://hbr.org/2019/01/are-your-high-expectations-hurting-your-team). While you should hold people to a high standard, you shouldn’t hold out for perfection.)

#### Make It an Iterative Process

As you learn more about the trainee, they should get new assignments tailored to their strengths, weaknesses, and preferences.

(Shortform note: [To make sure that you’re setting them up for success](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things/chapter-5), provide all the resources they need to do each new assignment well.)

#### Resist Micromanaging

Don’t dictate what people should do. Instead, Dalio says, train them and give your input, but let them make decisions on their own. If you find that micromanaging them is necessary, then it may be a sign that you hired the wrong person.

(Shortform note: You may also need to reflect on your need to micromanage—it might not be because of the person’s lack of ability but because of your fear of failure. Remember that your job as a manager isn’t to keep people from taking risks and failing, but to [create a workplace where they can fail and learn from their mistakes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-3).)

### Delivering Feedback

Feedback is a key component of Dalio’s principle of extreme honesty. You should constantly deliver feedback throughout the training period and beyond, because it allows a person to recalibrate if they’re missing the mark. However, it can be painful for the recipient to hear. Thus, he gives the following tips to make delivering feedback a more objective, straightforward process:

#### Start From Specific Data Points

Look for patterns, then build up to a larger picture.

(Shortform note: Some people might refuse to acknowledge that they have areas for improvement—these specific data points prepare you to [give concrete examples and evidence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-output-management/chapter-3) to back up your assessment.)

#### Help the Recipient Focus

**When giving feedback,** **ask the recipient to focus on whether the feedback is true**, rather than the implications of that feedback (such as whether they’ll be demoted). Ask, “Does this feedback sound accurate to you?” Dalio says you can use this to learn about them and discover primary sources of their issues together.

(Shortform note: While getting employees’ feedback during the process is a good practice, Andrew Grove [cautions against asking them for a self-review](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-output-management/chapter-3). In _[High Output Management](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-output-management)_, he writes that this might make them feel like you weren’t paying attention to their work.)

#### Keep _Yourself_ Focused

**Reflect on what is succeeding and not succeeding, but stay focused on the actual situation.** If things are going poorly, don’t feel obligated to balance compliments and criticisms for the sake of being nice. Dalio tends to avoid celebrating how great people are and instead focuses on where they need to improve.

(Shortform note: When assessing their performance, avoid giving vague, generalized feedback and instead [give more specific comments](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things) so they know exactly what’s working and what’s not. For example, instead of saying, “Your presentations need work,” you should say, “You can improve your presentations by shortening the bullet points and adding year-on-year graphs.”)

#### Clarify the Context

If communicating a weakness or mistake, put it into the context of the person’s total evaluation. Dalio says that a glancing comment from a superior could make someone afraid of being fired.

(Shortform note: Take care not to fall into the other extreme: the [“feedback sandwich,”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisacohn/2017/06/20/please-stop-using-the-feedback-sandwich/?sh=329112fd7945) where you try to soften the blow of negative feedback by delivering it in the middle of positive feedback. Instead, communicate your good intentions behind giving the feedback, which is to help them improve.)

#### Equate Accuracy and Kindness

**Remind the person receiving feedback that accuracy and kindness are the same thing.** Dalio re-emphasizes that pain is a signal for reflection and finding the truth, and that the truth is more important to meeting their goals and becoming successful than satisfying their ego.

(Shortform note: In _[Dare to Lead](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, Brené Brown similarly stresses that giving [polite, dishonest feedback is unfair and unkind](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-1-2), because people don’t know they need to improve and yet are expected to improve.)

#### Don’t Sugarcoat Failure

**Let them see their failures so clearly** that they are motivated to change them. (Shortform note: Employees may react emotionally to a clear explanation of their failures and may not be able to properly process information during an in-person discussion, so consider [giving them a written review ahead of time](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-output-management/chapter-3).)

### Evaluation

Performance evaluations help you determine if a person is a good fit for the job. Keep in mind that it’s not just for new hires but also for experienced employees. Dalio gives the following tips for evaluating people:

#### Seek Out Other Opinions

Don’t be overconfident about your assessments. Whether you’re evaluating a trainee or an experienced employee, it’s best to triangulate your view with other people.

(Shortform note: This aligns with one of the rising trends in performance evaluations: the [socially-based feedback system](https://hbr.org/2021/01/are-peer-reviews-the-future-of-performance-evaluations). In this system, employees receive comprehensive feedback from colleagues, peers, and other managers, instead of relying on feedback from one boss.)

#### Give Continuous Feedback

Review goals, tasks, and responsibilities at least once a quarter. Dalio stresses that periodic performance reviews should contain few surprises—you should deliver feedback _continuously_ so that people know where they stand.

(Shortform note: Consider [implementing peer reviews](https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution) instead of the traditional manager-led performance reviews Dalio suggests. Also called [360 reviews](https://www.inc.com/thomas-koulopoulos/performance-reviews-are-dead-heres-what-you-should-do-instead.html), peer reviews gather feedback from a larger group of colleagues to paint a more well-rounded picture of an employee’s performance.)

#### Make Your Metrics for Success Clear-Cut and Impartial

Define the most critical metrics, and have the discipline to check them regularly. Even better, tie the metrics formulaically to predetermined consequences (like bonuses).

(Shortform note: Some argue that [bonuses aren’t ideal](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/carrots-and-sticks-don-t-work/chapter-2) because they may not work on individuals who aren’t interested in the specific rewards, encourages unethical behavior, and corrodes teamwork, among other reasons. In _[Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/carrots-and-sticks-don-t-work/1-page-summary)_, author Paul Marciano says you can better motivate people through a system of respect, empowerment, supportive feedback, partnering, expectations, consideration, and trust.)

#### Be Fair

This means holding all employees to the same standards, whether they’re strong performers or not. It also means giving credit where it’s due, and giving the harshest feedback to those in the wrong instead of diluting the feedback by spreading the blame.

(Shortform note: Half of executives in a survey don’t believe in the efficacy of evaluation systems because they perceive a lack of fairness. You can [increase fairness](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-fairness-factor-in-performance-management) by being clear about how employees’ work fits into the organization’s priorities, coaching employees through meaningful discussions, and saving big rewards for the top 20% of workers who typically contribute 80% of the value.)

#### Don’t Judge People Based on Outcomes Alone

Often, people get a poor evaluation because they produce poor outcomes. However, Dalio says you should look at more than just outcomes and consider how people got there. They may have ended up with poor outcomes due to circumstances they couldn’t control, despite doing everything right and having sound reasoning behind their decisions.

Dalio’s tactic is to ask probing questions to assess people’s thinking. If he finds that their way of thinking repeatedly leads to poor outcomes over time, he considers if their weaknesses are trainable.

(Shortform note: It’s thus important to clarify your [expectations of employees when it comes to both their results and their behavior](https://hbr.org/2012/12/evaluating-the-employees-you-c). If you focus solely on results, then employees might engage in unacceptable behavior as long as they produce good outcomes. For example, [Wells Fargo employees resorted to fraud](https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-leadership-blind-spots-at-wells-fargo) just so they could meet their sales goals.)

#### Check Behavior, and Deter Bad Behavior

More people than you think will cheat if given the opportunity. You can audit or investigate people, explaining why you’re doing this, and they shouldn’t take this personally as a lack of trust but as just part of checks and balances. Dalio adds that auditors’ procedures shouldn’t be known to those being audited, and auditors themselves should be audited. If you find a rule violation, use “public hangings” to deter future bad behavior.

> Having remote or hybrid work setups makes it harder to keep an eye on employees’ behavior. There are tools to monitor employees working out of office, but [close surveillance may erode trust](https://hbr.org/2020/05/how-to-monitor-your-employees-while-respecting-their-privacy), increase stress, and decrease productivity.
> 
> If you _must_ monitor your remote workers, [keep these five tips in mind](https://hbr.org/2020/05/how-to-monitor-your-employees-while-respecting-their-privacy):
> 
> - Discuss appropriate metrics with workers, and track only what’s necessary.
>     
> - Show respect and foster trust by being honest about what you’re monitoring and why.
>     
> - Realize that employees are human, and that even high performers can have days that aren’t particularly productive.
>     
> - Be fair—the rules that apply to junior employees should also apply to more senior ones.
>     
> - Pull back when you recognize that some areas can do with less surveillance.

### Decision Points

After evaluating employees’ performance, you need to decide how to move forward. Dalio gives guidelines for what to do depending on the results of the evaluation.

#### For People Who Aren’t Working

Some people are just not suited for the jobs they were hired for. Keeping them in those jobs is toxic to the entire system. Not only does it compromise meritocracy and lower morale, but it also holds back the person’s personal evolution—you prevent them from discovering another way they could contribute to your organization or another. In this case, Dalio says you should:

##### Diagnose the Failure to Get to the Primary Source

It can be due to design problems in the machine (such as giving someone too many responsibilities), lack of training, lack of abilities, or lack of values. If it’s a lack of skills or training, consider adding guardrails: structures that help people stay on course, such as team members who have the strengths to compensate for others’ weaknesses. If the problem is a lack of values or abilities, don’t rehabilitate them—Dalio says that values and abilities don’t change much. (Shortform note: If you find that the cause of the failure can’t be rehabilitated and that [you’ll have to let someone go](https://hbr.org/2019/01/how-to-decide-whether-to-fire-someone), take swift action. Dragging it out sends a signal to your team that you can’t make tough decisions.)

##### Look Elsewhere for Fit

**Figure out whether the person is a better fit for another job in the organization.** But be careful—understand why they failed, and make sure this won’t happen again in the new job. (Shortform note: [If you’re considering an internal transfer](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8121-employee-job-transition.html) for an underperforming employee, communicate that your goal is to help them make use of untapped skills and to help them reach their full potential—but, make sure those untapped skills actually _exist._ Otherwise, the employee just becomes someone else’s problem.)

##### Beware of Demotion

**If the person is failing in a role they were promoted to, Dalio cautions against letting them step back into their previous role.** The person may resent being demoted to a job they probably can’t advance beyond. It may be better for them to start anew elsewhere. It’s hard to fire people you like and care about, but it’s necessary for the good of the organization.

> **Is Demotion Ever a Good Idea?**
> 
> While Dalio says you should beware of demoting people, there are [two situations where a demotion might work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffhyman/2018/08/29/demote/?sh=177d014e3195):
> 
> - A high performer doesn’t translate their performance into a managerial role. You might promote a strong individual contributor without considering if their skills translate well into management. If you see them struggling, try training them first. If you don’t see any improvement, consider restoring them to their previous role where they were able to make good contributions.
>     
> - The employee has skills that don’t match their current role. For example, a salesperson with weak interpersonal skills but strong technological know-how might do better if they step down to a sales support role.
>     
> 
> As Dalio says, an employee may resent getting demoted, so handle it with care: Say that the organization would like to offer them a position that’s better suited to their skills, let them know that you want them to stay, and map out a more viable career plan for them.

#### For People Who Are Excelling

Great people with great values and capabilities are rare. Dalio doesn’t offer detailed tips for managing these people. He only says that you should think about how to keep them and encourage them to speak up about how things are going.

(Shortform note: Companies that find ways to recognize high performers have a turnover rate that’s 31% lower than “low-recognition” companies. In _[Measure What Matters](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/measure-what-matters)_, venture capitalist John Doerr writes that you can [establish a “high-recognition” culture](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/measure-what-matters/part-2-chapters-15-16) by introducing a peer-to-peer recognition system, where employees can show their appreciation for their colleagues. For example, you can allot time during weekly meetings for employees to recognize colleagues who did good work. You can also use the company newsletter to tell stories of how people contributed to achieving the company’s goals.)
