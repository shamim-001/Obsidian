## Introduction

**Most humans crave order and meaning in their existence, to deal with the terrifying uncertainty of the world.** For much of history, this function was served by religion, with rules handed down by gods and supernatural surveillance of behavior. Despite differences in the beliefs, all major religions drew on common themes, and the _need_ for rules and order was universal. The ubiquity of this suggests something biological or evolutionary.

The developed world is moving to greater secularism, as a result of: scientific explanations of the world’s uncertainty; critical thinking around religion and the logical impracticality of all religions being true at once; and moral relativism.

But take away religion, and a void remains. There is no scientific code of ethics that inherited the stabilizing role of religion. **In the absence of clear rules and a moral compass, people are prone to nihilism, existential angst, and misery.**

In _12 Rules for Life_, Peterson argues that there _is_ a right and wrong way to conduct your life. In contrast, he rejects the ambiguity of moral relativism, the idea that good and evil are merely matters of subjective opinion and that every belief has its own truth. Moral relativism tolerates all ideas to avoid being “judgmental,” and prevents adults from telling young people how to live. It also rejects thousands of years of development of virtue and how to live properly.

In this vacuum of guidance on how to live, many are drawn to group-centered belief (like political or national allegiance) or ideologies instead, because it gives them identity, purpose, and a shared code of conduct. It simplifies the world.

- For decades Peterson was bewildered by the question of the Cold War - how could people risk world destruction for their belief systems? He questioned both the fervor of Americans and Communists.
- He concluded that people adopt shared beliefs to avoid the negative emotions spurred by chaos. People are willing to fight to protect something that saves them from the existential terror of nihilism.

As a solution, Peterson focuses on **individual responsibility**. The central tenets are:

- Take responsibility for your own life. Don’t worry about others' problems - fix your own first. If everyone did this, many society-level problems would be solved.
- Walk the line between order and chaos, where life is stable enough but also unpredictable enough to provoke personal growth. In other words, push yourself to the limit of your ability and challenge yourself.
- Acknowledge that life is suffering. Your goal is to make progress to avoid suffering.
    - Overprotective adults avoid discussing suffering with their children, with the hope that it will protect them from it. This just makes children unprepared to deal with suffering when they run into it.
- If we lived properly as described above, we would be resistant to the pains of existence and to the enticing lures of empty ideologies promising safety.

That this book has hit such a chord supports the first point, that most people crave order and structure. The rest of the book clarifies the _12 Rules for Life_, with themes of individual responsibility, being truthful to yourself, and defining your own meaning for life.
