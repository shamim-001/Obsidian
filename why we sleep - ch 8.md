# Why We Sleep

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Chapter 8: How Sleep Deprivation Harms the Body

In addition to the damage it causes to the brain, **sleep deprivation disrupts the normal function of many physiological processes, likely contributing to chronic diseases**. In this chapter Walker covers nine health issues associated with sleep deprivation.

At a high level, sleep deprivation of even just one to two hours triggers the sympathetic nervous system (**fight or flight response**) and disrupts hormonal balances. He says that this also implies that sleep is necessary for the normal maintenance of physiology.

(Shortform note: [Guzey includes a graph from this chapter](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#ok-even-if-the-who-never-formally-declared-any-sleep-loss-epidemics-there-still-is-a-global-sleep-loss-epidemic-right) that illustrates how average sleep time has decreased by more than two hours between the 1940s and 2000s. However, he has been unable to find the source of the data. He argues that evidence shows no reduction, or even suggests an increase, in sleeping time over this time period.)

> **A Note on the Studies in _Why We Sleep_**
> 
> Many of the _population_ studies cited in _Why We Sleep_ are correlational—for example, their results show that people who sleep less are more likely to have heart disease, after controlling for many other factors. But the causation of these results is unclear—some other factors that predispose people to heart disease (like a high baseline level of stress) could also reduce sleep.
> 
> To address this, the _experimental_ studies Walker cites attempt to link lack of sleep to a middle physiological state, which itself is causative for the disease. For instance, a lack of sleep increases blood pressure, which the medical consensus believes is causative for heart disease.
> 
> Ideally, the “smoking gun” experiment would be to randomize people into normal-sleep and low-sleep groups for years, then observe the rate of disease. However, this is impractical (it’s hard to run very long studies like this and impossible to double-blind) and likely unethical (if low sleep is already believed to cause severe disease).

### 1) Heart Disease

Walker claims that sleep deprivation has a number of effects related to cardiovascular disease:

- It activates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to:
    - Increased heart rate
    - Increased vasoconstriction, and subsequently, increased blood pressure
    - Increased cortisol (stress hormone)
    - Increased atherosclerosis (especially of coronary arteries)
- Through hormone signaling, it decreases HDL (good cholesterol) and growth hormone (which promotes recovery of blood vessel endothelium)

A population study showed that shorter sleep was associated with a 45% increased risk of developing heart disease.

He notes an interesting finding: daylight savings time is a natural sleep experiment that typically increases or decreases sleep by one hour. When the clock moves forward and the population gets one less hour of sleep, there is a [significant spike in heart attacks](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019) and the number of traffic accidents.

(Shortform note: Guzey writes that [Walker seems to misrepresent studies on the relationship between sleep and cardiovascular health](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#appendix-a-strong-contender-for-the-single-most-absurd-paragraph-in-the-book). Walker got some key figures wrong—saying that one study involved over half a million people when it involved 474,684, for example—and also included statistics about “cardiac arrests” that were not found in one paper. [The author addresses this in an interview](https://peterattiamd.com/matthewwalker4/), correcting the erroneous numbers that he cited and saying that the paper referred to “cardiac events,” and not cardiac arrests as he had written. He also [includes these corrections in his blog](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#CVD) and in the second edition.)

### 2) Diabetes

Sleep deprivation reduces insulin responsiveness, which causes hyperglycemia.

- In an experiment, after four hours of sleep a night for six nights, subjects were 40% less effective at absorbing a standard dose of glucose.

Walker says that in a population study, those sleeping less than six hours a night showed higher rates of type 2 diabetes (after controlling for body weight, alcohol, smoking, and other factors).

(Shortform note: A study suggests that obese people who are [night owls have a 37% risk of type 2 diabetes versus morning larks](https://consumer.healthday.com/5-13-being-a-night-owl-raises-odds-for-diabetes-if-youre-obese-2652948787.html), who have just a 9% risk. You may not be able to change your chronotype, but you can change your lifestyle to help control your weight. Avoid having a big dinner, eat a healthy diet, and get enough exercise.)

### 3) Obesity and Weight Gain

As it relates to weight, sleep deprivation:

- Reduces leptin (the hormone that makes you feel full) and increases ghrelin (the hormone that makes you feel hungry). It becomes harder to feel satisfied after eating.
- Increases endocannabinoids (which reduces pain sensation but increases appetite; also released in runner’s high), which increases eating
- Makes you feel lethargic, which makes you less likely to exercise
- Disrupts the linkage between the rational prefrontal cortex and the primal appetite center in the brain (similar to emotional control in the last chapter), so it becomes harder to regulate your eating

Walker describes an experiment in which subjects were randomized into a normal eight-hour sleep group, and a low four-hour sleep group. Both groups had the same amount of physical activity and free access to food, with the researchers closely monitoring their calorie consumption.

- The low-sleep group ate 300 more calories each day over the four-day period.
- Given an additional food buffet after lunch on the last day, the low-sleep group consumed an additional 330 calories in snack foods.

One might argue that decreased sleep naturally causes more calorie burn, but Walker points out that **an all-nighter actually consumes only 147 more calories than sleeping**. Sleep is metabolically more intense than you might guess.

Finally, if you’re losing weight and sleep deprived, the shift of where you lose the weight _from_ differs. When sleep-deprived, 70% of weight loss comes from lean body mass like muscles, compared to under 50% with plentiful sleep.

(Shortform note: On the flip side, some weight-loss efforts may have a detrimental effect on sleep as studies suggest that going on a [low-carbohydrate diet might end up keeping you up at night](https://www.livestrong.com/article/482729-i-cant-sleep-on-a-low-carb-diet/). This is because consuming fewer carbs leads to the decreased production of sleep-inducing melatonin, while more protein leads to the increased production of energizing epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in a one-two sleeplessness punch.)

### 4) Reproductive System

Sleep deprivation has an effect on both the _inner_ and _outer_ mechanisms of reproducing: your hormones and your ability to attract a mate.

#### Hormones

Walker says that in males, short sleep duration decreases testosterone, testical size, and sperm count.

- Experimentally, this is acute—five hours of sleep for one week “ages” a man 10-15 years in terms of testosterone levels.
- Beyond libido, testosterone also governs bone density and muscle mass.

(Shortform note: [The study Walker uses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445839/) to support his claim has a very small sample size of only 10 men, which may [make its results less reliable](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3475).)

In females, he says sleep deprivation reduces follicular-releasing hormone (necessary for conception), increases abnormal menstrual cycles, and causes more issues with infertility.

#### Attractiveness

Your face is rated as less attractive and less healthy after one night of short sleep. So according to Walker, there might be something to the idea of “beauty sleep.”

(Shortform note: To make the connection between attractiveness and short sleep, Walker cites [one study where two groups of participants were photographed](https://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6614): one group after eight hours’ sleep and another after just five hours’ sleep. The sleep-deprived group was rated as looking less attractive. However, Walker does not mention that the second group had been deprived of sleep for 31 hours prior to their night of reduced sleep. [As one reviewer points out](https://forum.guzey.com/t/more-sensationalism-playing-fast-and-loose-with-numbers-incorrect-interpretations-etc-in-why-we-sleep/52/2), there’s a big difference between someone who’s had five hours of sleep versus someone who’s had five hours of sleep after being awake for 31 hours.)

### 5) Immune System

Walker goes on to explain that sleep deprivation reduces your ability to ward off infectious disease:

- In an experiment, subjects exposed to low sleep over one week were 50% likely to develop a cold when exposed to a virus, versus 18% who experienced normal sleep. (Shortform note: [A reviewer](https://forum.guzey.com/t/more-sensationalism-playing-fast-and-loose-with-numbers-incorrect-interpretations-etc-in-why-we-sleep/52) questions Walker’s interpretation of the data that says that low sleep makes you 50% more likely to develop a cold. The [study Walker references](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26118561/) shows that around 45% of those who slept less than five hours developed a cold and around 30% of those who slept for five to six hours developed a cold.)
- Sleep deprivation reduces the immune response to flu vaccines by over 50%. (Shortform note: Research published in 2020 suggests that the [most crucial time to get sufficient sleep is the two nights prior to vaccination](https://socialecology.uci.edu/news/lack-sleep-reduces-flu-shot-effectiveness).)
- Sleep deprivation reduces circulating levels of natural killer cells, a part of your immune system that identifies and gets rid of harmful elements such as infections and cancerous tumor cells. (Shortform note: Research suggests that [this is only a short-term effect](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.9111&rep=rep1&type=pdf), linked to the amount of sleep the night before.)

### 6) Cancer

Sleep deprivation increases cancer severity in three ways, according to Walker:

- Sleep deprivation prompts inflammation that promotes blood vessel development, diverting nutrients to the cancer cells.
- Inflammation also promotes metastasis, or the spread of cancer from its original source to other parts of the body
- Based on experimental evidence from mice, sleep deprivation reduces levels of M1 cells, which combat cancer, while increasing levels of M2 cells, which promote cancer growth. This combination increases the risk of developing or worsening cancer.

(Shortform note: In the first edition, Walker wrote that routinely sleeping six or seven hours a night doubles your risk of cancer. Researcher [Guzey disputes this](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#also-no----sleeping-less-than-6-hours-a-night-does-not-double-your-risk-of-cancer), saying that Walker doesn’t cite any studies to support this claim, and that a systematic review of 65 studies didn’t find a link between sleep duration and cancer risk. Walker modified the wording in the second edition to say that routinely sleeping six or seven hours a night “substantially increases your risk of certain forms of cancer.” Additionally, in his blog, he writes that [short sleep isn’t linked to all types of cancer](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#cancer), but that it’s associated with increasing the risk of specific cancers, such as lung, ovarian, thyroid, and blood cancer.)

He also cites population studies that show a link between **nighttime shift work and increased risk of cancer** (common occupations include nurses and pilots). In response to these studies, Denmark now pays workers’ compensation to women who developed breast cancer after doing night-shift work in government-sponsored jobs.

(Shortform note: In the first edition, Walker had written that the WHO had classified nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, but reviewers questioned this information as they were unable to find any evidence that the WHO had said this. Walker corrects this in the second edition and [in his blog](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#shift_work), clarifying that the information was in fact from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is under WHO.)

### 7) Aging

[Telomeres act as caps at the ends of DNA strands](https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/what-are-telomeres), protecting them from getting frayed—much like the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces. They get shorter over time, a process which theoretically contributes to aging. Walker writes that sleep deprivation has been shown to hasten telomere shortening, thus implying an increase in aging.

(Shortform note: Guzey points out [another percentage error](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#no-two-thirds-of-adults-in-developed-nations-do-not-fail-to-obtain-the-recommended-amount-of-sleep) in the section about sleep loss, gene activity, and DNA. Walker originally wrote that gene activity in mice drops by “well over 200%” when they’re sleep deprived, but he has since revised it to say that gene activity becomes “significantly impaired.”)

### 8) Decreased Athletic Performance

Sleep deprivation also worsens general athletic performance: getting less sleep decreases your aerobic capacity, time to exhaustion, and recovery, and it increases risk of injury and lactic acid generation.

> In the first edition of the book, Walker included a graph showing that the likelihood of injury decreases the more sleep you get—those who get six hours of sleep a night are over 70% likely to get injured, while those who sleep nine hours a night have an under-20% chance of getting injured. [Guzey notes that Walker cut out a portion of the source graph](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#appendix-what-do-you-do-when-a-part-of-the-graph-contradicts-your-argument-you-cut-it-out-of-course) showing that those who get five hours a night are less likely to get injured than those who get six or seven hours. Statistician Andrew Gelman writes that this sort of [data manipulation may count as research misconduct](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/12/27/why-we-sleep-data-manipulation-a-smoking-gun/).
> 
> Walker has since replaced the graph with one that has just two values: one showing the pooled injury risk for those who less than eight hours, and one for those who got eight hours or more. In his blog, he writes that [the updated graph better represents the study authors’ statistical analysis](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#sleep_injury).

### 9) Death

Gravely, Walker states that **sleep deprivation can directly cause death**.

In rodent studies, REM sleep deprivation causes death over the same period as food deprivation—about 15 days.

- NREM sleep deprivation causes death too, after 45 days.
- Sleep-deprived rats lose body weight, despite eating more. They can no longer regulate their body temperature, causing intense metabolism.
- The immune system is destroyed, causing widespread skin sores.
- The cause of death is universally septicemia or a systemic bacterial infection, caused by the gut microbiome (normally held in check by a functioning immune system).

In humans, sleep deprivation leading to death is uncommon (possibly since the natural urge to sleep is so strong). But lack of sleep could contribute to more acute causes of death like seizures, and thus be misreported.

(Shortform note: In the book’s first chapter, Walker writes that shorter sleep leads to a shorter life span. Guzey notes the lack of citation and [shares a graph from one study](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#no-shorter-sleep-does-not-imply-shorter-life-span) that shows that the optimal number of hours of sleep is seven. It also shows that the mortality rate for five hours of sleep is very similar to that of eight hours of sleep. In his blog, [Walker responds to this](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#short-sleep), saying that this was not the conclusion of the study—the study authors stated that “seven hours/day of sleep duration should be recommended to prevent premature death among adults.” He goes on to say that the study involved two assessments: 1) amount of sleep during the study, 2) whether the individuals were still alive years later. For some, the second assessment took place more than 20 years after the first, with no analysis of any changes in sleep patterns in between, which means that the study had limitations. Walker mentions [other studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6878979/) that support his assertions that shorter sleep is associated with a shorter life span.)

Walker’s strongest evidence that humans can die from sleep deprivation is a very rare inherited condition, **fatal familial insomnia**. In this disease, prion proteins destroy the thalamus, and **the patient is totally unable to sleep**, even with heavy sedatives. Severe disability sets in (dementia, speech disorders), and death occurs within 10 months. There are no treatments or preventions. This disease is autosomal dominant and found in only 40 families worldwide.

(Shortform note: In the book’s first chapter, Walker refers to a very rare genetic disorder (FFI) and how, after 12-18 months, a patient suffering from the disease will die. In the first edition, he wrote, “Though exceedingly rare, this disorder asserts that a lack of sleep can kill a human being.” This sentence has been removed from the second edition, possibly because it seems to run counter to Walker’s assertions in Chapter 12—that death from the lack of sleep due to FFI is scientifically inconclusive as there may be other factors at play. In his blog, [Guzey refers to a passage from the Encyclopedia of Sleep](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#no-lack-of-sleep-will-not-outright-kill-you) that explains how FFI is a neurodegenerative disease, so sleep loss itself isn’t necessarily the cause of death.)

> **Evolutionary Reasoning for Sleep Deprivation’s Damage**
> 
> Why would animals evolve so that sleep deprivation causes all these bad issues? Consider that in caveman days, times of low sleep may mean conditions that threaten survival (low food stores, tough weather, hostility with another tribe). The responses—hoarding calories, the “fight-or-flight” system, and decreased reproduction—might promote short-term survival but come at the expense of long-term well-being.

### How Much Sleep Should We Get?

Let’s return to the question of normal sleep amounts.

On the lower end, you may have seen reports of hunter-gatherer tribes who sleep just 6.5 hours, leading to assertions that this is a universally “natural” state for all humans. They also are rarely obese.

But Walker says this is a misguided conclusion. In reality, the hunter-gatherer tribes are basically perpetually starving, since food is never abundant for long periods of time. Starvation naturally induces less sleep, so that animals stay awake longer to search for food. (This also decreases obesity.)

To wit, the average life span of hunter-gatherers is just 58 years, much shorter than humans in industrialized societies. **In nutrition-rich situations, most humans need eight hours of sleep.**

(Shortform note: While Walker claims that humans need eight hours of sleep now, as opposed to our hunter-gatherer ancestors’ 6.5 hours, Guzey cites studies suggesting that [people who sleep just six hours a night might actually have the lowest mortality rate](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#appendix-people-who-sleep-just-6-hours-a-night-might-have-the-lowest-mortality). There are also cases of [people with a short sleep gene](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/08/415261/after-10-year-search-scientists-find-second-short-sleep-gene), which means they only need four to six hours of sleep a night with no adverse effects to their health. While not getting enough sleep can affect the average person’s performance and mood, [natural short sleepers are typically driven and optimistic](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/health/short-sleep-gene-wellness-scn/index.html).)

#### Can You Sleep Too Much?

Some population studies show increased risk of death in those who regularly sleep more than nine hours, suggesting sleeping too much might be harmful. But the author argues this data is confounded by infection and cancers in long-sleeping people [though these confounds should already have been controlled for].

(Shortform note: [Walker elaborates on this argument in his blog](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#short-sleep). He writes that one challenge of measuring sleep through surveys is that respondents don’t differentiate between being in bed and being asleep. Thus, the increased risk of death associated with long sleep may be due to _poor-quality_ sleep and not _too much_ sleep.)
