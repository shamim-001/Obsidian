## Chapters 5-9: Find God Through Meditation

Arjuna, ever-practical, points out that Krishna has now recommended both selfless action, _and_ the complete renunciation of physical attachments—including actions—which is called _sannyasa_. He asks which is the better path to God and Brahman.

**Krishna answers that both paths lead to freedom from karma, but action is better.** Renouncing _all_ physical attachments and actions is very difficult, especially for someone like Arjuna, whose dharma is to fight and lead. Therefore, it’s better to take the necessary actions and perform them with no sense of self or egotism.

Krishna compares the body to a “city” with nine gates: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the anus, and the urethra. By mastering selfless action, Arjuna’s Atman—his true self—will be the master of his body, ruling it like a king rules a city from the safety of his palace.

**Krishna reiterates that all sense-objects are temporary; not real, and not worth pursuing.** Any pleasures that Arjuna might seek in the world will be similarly temporary and will only cause him more suffering in the long run. Rather, through meditation and selfless action, Arjuna’s one and only goal should be understanding his true self; that he is part of Vishnu and Brahman, and that they are part of him.

### Different Kinds of Meditation

Meditation likely brings to mind an image of someone sitting peacefully, legs folded, breathing slowly, and focusing inward. However, such inactive meditation isn’t currently suitable for Arjuna the warrior prince, who must protect and lead his people.

If the goal of meditation is peace and understanding, then the best place for Arjuna to start is with what Krishna has spoken of several times already: selfless action. Once he has achieved a level of self-realization through selfless action, he will be ready to seek inner peace and stillness through meditation.

Although it’s not yet time for Arjuna to meditate, Krishna gives him detailed instructions on how to do so when the time comes. He tells him to find a clean, comfortable spot, and to sit down on a cloth, a deerskin, and a patch of grass. He should sit perfectly straight, with his body, head, and neck all on the same line, and focus on something in front of him to keep his eyes (and attention) from wandering.

Once seated comfortably in this position, Arjuna should focus only on Vishnu. By turning every thought toward God, he’ll cleanse himself of attachment to sense-objects. This will be possible if he has let go of fear by understanding his true self, and let go of desire by dedicating his actions to Brahman.

Krishna warns that moderation in all things is key to successful meditation. Those who overindulge themselves will be bound by their desires; they won’t be able to meditate properly because they’ll be focused on themselves rather than God. Those who deny themselves everything—such as ascetic monks—won’t have the strength or focus to maintain their meditative states.

**The end goal of meditation is _nirvana_, a state of perfect joy and peace where the person is united with Vishnu, even while still alive.** Someone who’s reached nirvana has unshakeable focus and perfect understanding of his Atman. Understanding that everyone and everything comes from the same divine sources, such people react to others’ joys and hardships as if they were their own, and have no concern for who is a friend or an enemy; indeed, someone who’s attained nirvana wouldn’t even be able to view someone else as an enemy.

Finally, Krishna says that—while selfless work is important and a crucial first step toward self-realization—meditation is the best way to escape karma and be united with him.

#### Different Types of Will

During his discussion of meditation, Krishna also briefly discusses will. **In doing so, he draws an important distinction between will and self-will.** Self-will, called _ahamkara_, is the negative kind of will that one might find in a so-called “willful” child. This type of will is focused on desires and pleasures through sense-objects; in other words, it’s the force that drives people to get what they think they want.

Will, on the other hand, is what allows people to withdraw their senses, deny themselves the immediate pleasures of sense-objects, and find their true selves. This is what’s required to properly meditate and understand oneself.

**Will is the friend of the Atman, the true self; self-will is its enemy.** Krishna urges Arjuna to use will to conquer and master himself, and to never let himself be dragged down by self-will.

#### There Is No Failure in Spiritual Work

Arjuna, who is still upset by the prospect of waging war against his own family, says that he can’t even imagine the kind of stillness and peace that Krishna’s describing. He protests that trying to control his thoughts is like trying to catch the wind. **Krishna acknowledges that mastering oneself is extremely difficult, but insists that it’s possible through practice, detachment, and self-control.**

This leads Arjuna to ask what happens if he tries and fails. He’s concerned that if he begins doing such spiritual work, but strays from the path and doesn’t achieve true union with Vishnu and Brahman, that he’ll no longer be welcome in either the material world or the spiritual afterlife.

**Krishna reassures him that that’s impossible.** If Arjuna begins the work of self-realization and union with the divine but isn’t able to finish it in his lifetime, he’ll be rewarded rather than punished. His afterlife will be a pleasant and righteous one, and when the time comes for him to be reborn he’ll be born into a life where he can pick up the work where he left off. He’ll surely be born into a righteous family; if his karma is exceptionally good, he may be reborn into a family that practices meditation in the home, though such a thing is rare.

**No spiritual work is ever wasted, and there’s no such thing as failure.** If Arjuna needs more time to free himself from karma, he’ll have as many lifetimes as it takes.
