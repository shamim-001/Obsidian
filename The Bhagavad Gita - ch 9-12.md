## Chapters 9-12: Know and Love God

In these chapters, Krishna reiterates that he is the source of all things and present in all things, both physical and metaphysical. He goes further to say that he is the true form of the greatest gods in every pantheon worshipped by man. He expounds on how he is the highest mountain, the deepest valley, the mightiest lion; he is the true self inside every person; he is life, death, time, victory, honor, justice, and so on.

**Religious scholars consider Chapter 11 to be the most important part of the _Bhagavad Gita_.** In this chapter, Krishna reveals his true self to Arjuna—not the four-armed, blue-skinned being who commonly appears in art, but his real form: the beginning and end of all existence.

Following that great revelation, Chapter 12 focuses on the importance of not just devotion, but love, as the supreme motivator for spirituality. It’s not enough to simply know Vishnu; you have to love him in order to free yourself from reincarnation.

### Krishna’s True Nature

**Remember that, along with understanding himself, Arjuna must learn to understand Vishnu in order to escape from karma.** To that end, Krishna—who is an incarnation of Vishnu—begins talking about himself and his true nature.

He says that his prakriti—his physical form—is made of eight elements: earth, water, air, fire, _akasha_ (“sky” or “space”), mind, intelligence, and ego. However, beyond his prakriti is another, higher form. This other form created and supports everything that exists, and destroys it when the time comes. Though he has created many mortal bodies, Vishnu’s true self was never born and will never die. He is beyond such things; his true nature is eternal and changeless.

This higher nature is present in all things, from the taste of water to the light of the sun. Vishnu is people’s intelligence, strength, and honor. He is also the source of desire, as long as such desires are in tune with dharma and Brahman. He claims that the entire universe hangs from him like a necklace.

The three gunas—sattva, rajas, and tamas—also come from Vishnu, but he is not found in them. They make up his maya, his illusion that deceives the world. Vishnu’s maya is difficult to pass through, but those who seek him through selfless action and self-knowledge are able to cross his maya and rejoin his true self. He says that, while anyone who follows a spiritual path will be blessed, those who seek true union with Vishnu will have it and be considered as part of him.

Krishna explains that Brahman, the ultimate force and truth of the universe, is Vishnu’s highest nature. **The part of Brahman in every living thing is called adhyatma.** Adhibhuta is the mortal body, while adhidaiva is the intangible spirit (also called Purusha, like the physical body is also called prakriti). Finally, adhiyajna is sacrifice; both the offering itself and the force that compels people to offer it. Recognizing that all of these are from Vishnu and that Vishnu is in all of them is key to understanding his true nature.

Finally, Krishna talks about Brahma, another of his forms that is known to mortals as the creator deity. He says that a Day of Brahma, during which time the universe is created and exists, lasts for a thousand _yugas_, or eons. It is followed by a Night of Brahma lasting for an equal amount of time, wherein the universe is consumed and reduced to nothing. However, even during this time Brahma, who is Vishnu, is not destroyed.

(Note: To be more specific, a Day of Brahma lasts for 4.32 billion years. A Night of Brahma lasts the same amount of time.)

#### Vishnu Rewards Devotion

Though the truly wise seek out Vishnu, there are many who worship other gods—what Krishna calls “lower gods.” He says that these people have been deceived, but he rewards their devotion nonetheless.

**When a person is absolutely devoted to something, Vishnu grants the person that thing.** Those who want the fleeting pleasures of life will have them, while those who worship other gods will go to them in the afterlife (until they’re reborn, at least). However, those who are completely devoted to Vishnu will be reunited with him and break free of reincarnation. He promises that even the worst sinners can be quickly redeemed by meditating on and devoting their lives to Vishnu.

There are two paths the soul can take at death: Those who understand Brahman take the path of light, which leads them to the ultimate goal of freedom from the cycle of rebirth. Others follow a darker path that leads them to reincarnation. **By knowing and recognizing these two paths, Arjuna can ensure that he’ll never be fooled by the darker path again.**

### The True Form of God

Arjuna is awed by everything that Krishna has told him. Over the course of this conversation, Krishna has guided him from being a short-sighted warrior prince, concerned only with the battle in front of him, to someone who’s ready to begin the true spiritual work of breaking free from karma and reincarnation by devoting himself to Vishnu. However, Arjuna is still a practical person who needs to see things in order to fully grasp them. He begs Krishna to reveal his true, immortal self: the master of all creation.

Krishna agrees, promising to show Arjuna his countless forms, a sight that the greatest sages and mystics have longed to see but have never been allowed to. However, Krishna warns Arjuna that he won’t be able to see this vision with his eyes; instead, Krishna grants him spiritual sight that can perceive the true form of God.

Arjuna then sees a being who shines like a thousand suns all rising together. Krishna’s true self has an infinite number of faces overseeing the entire universe. He carries countless weapons in countless hands as symbols of his limitless power. **Within Krishna’s body, Arjuna sees the form of every object that has ever existed merged into one.**

Arjuna is completely overwhelmed and falls to his knees. He tries to tell Krishna what he is seeing. He sees the god Brahma sitting on a lotus flower, all of the ancient sages, and mythical monsters. The entire universe makes up God’s body, which has infinite mouths, stomachs, arms, and eyes. The being wears a crown and gleams with heavenly jewels. The light that radiates from its body warms everything that exists.

He sees that the true form of Vishnu is the ultimate mystery of the universe, the only truth that must be known to break free of karma. Vishnu is the eternal guardian of dharma, or fate, who is reborn again and again to keep the world on its ordained path.

Arjuna sees all other gods, demigods, and demons, and the universe itself shaking in fear before God’s true self. Arjuna himself is terrified by one part of the vision: All of the warriors who have gathered at Kurukshetra for the upcoming battle, the kings they fight for, the entire world, and countless other worlds are all streaming into Vishnu’s countless burning mouths, where they are destroyed and swallowed. Arjuna, who is now so frightened that he can’t even stand up, again begs Vishnu to explain what he is.

Vishnu responds that he is time, the ultimate destroyer. He repeats what he told Arjuna at the very beginning of the _Gita_: Everyone gathered at Kurukshetra will eventually die no matter what Arjuna does, and therefore he should fulfill his dharma and lead the Pandavas into battle. **Vishnu himself is the one who will kill them—Arjuna will simply be one of his countless weapons.** Vishnu promises that, should Arjuna stand and fight, he’ll win the battle.

#### The Ultimate Realization

Arjuna, who now sees what his childhood friend Krishna truly is, prostrates himself. He’s terrified that he might have accidentally disrespected Vishnu, and he begs forgiveness for the times when he addressed Krishna casually or thoughtlessly. He says that he’s happy to have seen Vishnu’s real self, but he repeats that he’s terrified. Arjuna begs Vishnu to go back to his more familiar, limited form.

Vishnu replies that, through his blessing, Arjuna has been given a look at something that no mortal has ever seen. **He praises Arjuna for being the first to receive this vision—neither mystical knowledge, nor meditation, nor rituals, nor asceticism can grant mortals a glimpse of the true form of God.** Even lesser gods try, and fail, to see what Arjuna saw. Only through true devotion to Vishnu can a human see what Arjuna just saw, understand Vishnu’s true nature, and be freed from karma to rejoin with him.

With that said, Vishnu returns to the human form of Krishna and begins to console the terrified prince.

#### The Importance of Love

After calming down, Arjuna asks—given what he just saw—whether it’s better to love Vishnu or to try to understand him. **Krishna answers that love is the better path of yoga (which, remember, means “union with God”).**

Those who try to understand Vishnu’s divine nature through study, meditation, and dampening their physical senses may very well find him and be freed from karma. However, grasping his true self—let alone seeing it, as Arjuna did—is extremely difficult for mortals. It’s easy for them to become distracted or discouraged, and so lose their way.

A much faster and more certain path is to do what Krishna advised Arjuna to do from the start: Live your dharma and perform good works with no sense of ego, acting purely out of love for God. **Those who simply do right, without worrying about how it will affect them personally, will find peace. Those who act selflessly will receive Vishnu’s love.**

A true yogi is one who’s unaffected by the physical world and all of its temporary sense-objects. Such people aren’t affected by good times or misfortune, and love all others equally—indeed, someone who truly understands Vishnu’s presence in all of us would not even be able to consider someone else an enemy, even in the midst of battle. They are all simply fragments of the divine fulfilling their own dharma.
