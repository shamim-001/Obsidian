## 5: Desirable Difficulties Enhance Learning

The learning strategies we’ve discussed improve comprehension and retention because **the more your brain has to work, the deeper it embeds the information.** In contrast to the belief that learning is effective when it’s easy and enjoyable, these kinds of challenges—called “desirable difficulties”—improve long-term learning.

To be clear, there are also _undesirable_ difficulties that don’t benefit your learning. A difficulty is undesirable if:

1. You don’t have the prior knowledge to overcome and learn from the difficulty
2. The difficulty doesn’t target skills you need

### Fear of Failure Inhibits Learning

If you push yourself, take risks, and engage in learning that incorporates desirable difficulties, you’ll inevitably fail sometimes. **Failure is not only a critical aspect of learning because it’s an invaluable opportunity to learn from your mistake.**

People who understand that mistakes and failures are critical to learning are more inclined to:

- Try challenging problems
- Persevere in their effort, undeterred by mistakes
- Advance further in their learning

Research proves the benefits of desirable difficulties in learning, but negative attitudes toward failure still persist from outdated theories.

In the mid-20th century, psychologist B.F. Skinner suggested that wrong answers inhibit learning and reflect poor teaching. Skinner pushed for “errorless learning” methods, in which teachers introduced new material bit by bit to make it easily digestible, and then tested students while the lesson was still fresh.

Most classrooms still don’t embrace errors. As a result, **many students develop a fear of failure that impedes their learning** in two ways: First, their fear inhibits them from trying challenging lessons.

Second, fear of failure produces anxiety in high-pressure situations, such as tests. Anxiety taxes your working memory, which is your capacity to keep information in your head while solving a problem. When performance anxiety strains your working memory, you have less mental bandwidth to actually figure out the problem in front of you.
