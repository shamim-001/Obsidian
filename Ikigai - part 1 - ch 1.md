## Part 1: Understanding Ikigai | Chapter 1: Defining Ikigai

Why do you get up in the morning? What gives your life meaning and purpose? Many people can’t answer these questions. Even worse, they’re stuck in dysfunctional lifestyles that prevent them from ever finding out what their purpose is.

In _Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long a Happy Life_, author and blogger Héctor García (author of _A Geek in Japan_) and novelist and self-help writer Francesc Miralles teach you to **apply the Japanese concept of _ikigai_, or life purpose, to your own life.** Drawing on lessons from the people of Okinawa, who live longer than anybody else on earth, as well as insights from art, philosophy, science, and psychology, they show you how to find and follow your ikigai and cultivate a happy, healthy lifestyle to sustain it.

Part 1 of this summary introduces the concept of ikigai and lays out the lifestyle principles of the Okinawan people. Part 2 teaches you to find your ikigai through learning what brings you meaning and flow (a term to be defined in Chapter 3). In Part 3, you’ll learn how to create good habits of eating, exercising, and thinking, and to forge a life of meaningful resilience as you bring value to the world by living out your purpose.

### Your Reason for Being

**The word _ikigai_ is essentially the Japanese equivalent of the French _raison d'être_, meaning a person’s reason for existing or life purpose.** According to the Japanese, each of us has a different _ikigai_.

You can think of your ikigai as your “existential fuel.” It’s the thing that keeps you going in life and the reason you get up in the morning. Your ikigai could involve helping people or enjoying their companionship. It could involve an art or craft, such as writing or painting. It could involve a sport or activity. It could involve business, science, or any number of other things.

You don’t necessarily have just a single ikigai. Einstein, for example, had two ikigais, physics and playing the violin. He said that if he hadn’t been a physicist, he would have devoted his life to music.

The following diagram helps to illustrate the various elements that go into your ikigai. Note that even though this book doesn’t explicitly address all of these elements, you can benefit from studying the diagram carefully to understand its “recipe” for ikigai and thereby gain a better sense of your own ikigai’s composition.

The purpose of this book is to introduce you to the concept of ikigai and help you understand how it can change your life. What unites us as humans is our search for meaning, the sense that our lives are _about_ something. When you find your ikigai, you’ll have found this meaning, and you can achieve a fulfilling state of flow every day, in everything you do.

As you read, notice the close connection between ikigai and longevity. This book is about both concepts, because living a long, happy life and discovering your life purpose are complementary. Each supports the other.

### Optimal Living: Lessons From Okinawa

**The relationship between life purpose and longevity is nowhere more apparent than in Japan.** The Japanese are known for their extraordinary longevity, especially on the southern island of Okinawa, whose people have the longest average life expectancy in the world. In fact, Okinawa is chief among the world’s five “Blue Zones,” the geographic regions where people live longer than anywhere else. Scientists who have studied Blue Zones say the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, strong social ties, and _having a life purpose_.

Okinawans also hold the concept of ikigai at the center of their lives. **Knowledge of the Okinawan way of life can therefore illuminate your search for your own ikigai and teach you to embody your ikigai in a long life of fulfillment.**

To learn how these Blue Zone factors play out in the lives of Japanese centenarians, García and Miralles visited the rural Okinawan town of Ogimi, whose residents have the longest average life span of all Okinawans.

#### Life in Ogimi

In Ogimi, the authors were amazed at the vitality of the nominally elderly Okinawans they met. For example, a sprightly 89-year-old woman named Yuki and her “copilot,” a 99-year-old woman, drove the authors to lunch at a local restaurant that served “slow food” made from locally grown organic vegetables. At a triple birthday party for two women (99 and 94) and a “young” man (89), the youngest attendee was 83 years old. The authors danced, celebrated, and did karaoke with this group. They also participated in a game of the popular low-impact Japanese sport of gateball, losing to a 104-year-old woman.

García and Miralles noticed the following things about Ogimi’s lifestyle:

- **The residents of Ogimi focus on their ikigais.** In Ogimi, everybody knows their ikigai, but they don’t obsess over it.
- **Residents of Ogimi never retire,** or at least not like Westerners do. In Ogimi and Okinawa, people stay incredibly active long after the end of their formal professional lives, continuing to pursue their ikigais.
- **Life in Ogimi is both intense and relaxed**. The residents are always busy with important things to do, but they do it all calmly, with each person pursuing their ikigai in an unhurried way. And yet they do everything, even little things, with passion.
- **Ogimi’s residents practice healthy habits.** They all grow their own vegetable gardens. They’re constantly busy with tasks that let them both relax and remain physically active, such as karaoke and playing gateball.
- **They focus their daily lives around the community.** They have a strong sense of teamwork and interpersonal connection, choosing to help each other with all kinds of work, from gardening to building houses. They celebrate frequently together through birthday parties, games, and so on.
- **In Ogimi, as in Okinawa as a whole, people come together in family-like groupings called _moai_.** Members contribute money to their moai each month and enjoy meetings, dinners, and games together. They also use their shared funds to support each other financially, and they’re deeply involved in volunteer work. Membership in a moai creates a sense of security and increases a person’s lifespan. For many Okinawans, taking care of their moai is part of their ikigai.

#### The Principles of Optimal Living

To uncover the principles behind Okinawan longevity, García and Miralles conducted 100 interviews with the oldest residents of Ogimi. They asked these people about their secrets to long life, their personal philosophy, and their ikigai. Then they boiled the resulting statements down to five principles or life lessons for optimal living:

1. **Refuse to worry.**
2. **Create positive habits.** For example, get up early. Grow a garden and tend it well. Eat a variety of good foods, preferably ones you’ve grown yourself. Keep working. Cultivate spirituality. Exercise and keep your body moving.
3. **Feed and nurture your friendships each day.** Eat and drink together. Talk together. Walk together. Sing together.
4. **Live unhurried.**
5. **Choose optimism.** Smile. Affirm each day that you will be healthy and energetic. Enjoy your family. Do volunteer work.

#### The Ikigai Connection

From their observations and interaction with the residents of Ogimi, García and Miralles also concluded that **ikigai stands above and behind all five of these principles and constitutes the heart of Japanese longevity.** The people they met in Ogimi displayed a clear sense of purpose. Some focused intensively on their gardens. Others focused on their friends or on volunteer projects. But all had a clear reason to get up each day, and this, more than anything, appeared to keep them enthusiastic and energetic into advanced old age.
