# Antifragile

## Chapter 20: The Fragility of the New

In this chapter we introduce the idea of making progress by taking away what’s fragile and flawed, rather than by adding new ideas and inventions to our systems. **In other words, we can move toward antifragility by eliminating fragility.**

This chapter also discusses people’s illogical obsession with new things. Looking through the lens of antifragility, it’s clear that something that’s withstood the test of time is almost guaranteed to be better than something new, whose fragility hasn’t yet been tested. Old ideas and technologies will generally outlive new ones. In spite of that, many people are constantly chasing after the “hot new thing.”

### Progress Through Negation

Readers may have noticed that, for all the talk of antifragility, most of the examples we’ve discussed so far have been fragile situations. **The reason is that, in many cases, antifragility is more about what you avoid than what you seek out.**

This is hardly a new idea, though the label “antifragility” was never attached to it before. The Arab scholar Ali Bin Abi-Taleb said that staying away from foolish people was as good as keeping company with wise men. The author Jon Elster, in his book _Preventing Mischief_, wrote that the purpose of legislation is to prevent things that might harm the people. In a more modern example, Steve Jobs said that innovation and focus aren’t about saying yes to the thing you’re working on, but saying no to everything else.

**In short, antifragility can be about getting rid of fragility.** Remember one of our earliest examples of antifragility: how people get stronger by exercising. It’s not done by somehow seeking out stronger muscle tissue. Instead, weak muscles break down and stronger muscles grow in their place.

People tend to have a problem with the concept of negatives, the idea that what _isn’t_ there is as important as what is. That’s why people who solve problems are praised, but people who avoid them in the first place often go unnoticed. In the same vein, people like being given concrete, actionable advice. That’s why there are countless self-help books out there advertising that they’ll give you a 10-step process for whatever you think you need help with.

However, some of our most concrete advancements—personal, scientific, or what have you—come from negation. That is, getting rid of what isn’t working or what we know to be wrong. **We, as a species, know much more about what’s untrue than what’s true.**

For example, if someone thinks that all swans are white, seeing a single black swan is enough to disprove that theory. However, seeing a thousand white swans isn’t enough to prove it. No matter how many white swans that person sees, there’s always the chance that a swan of another color could be out there somewhere.

We can also improve our own health and happiness by negating—that is, getting rid of—things that negatively impact them. **Just like antifragility is often about avoiding fragility, happiness is often about avoiding unhappiness.** Consider what people think is necessary for happiness: good health (that is, lack of sickness), money (lack of worry about material goods), and purpose (lack of boredom), to give a few common answers.

As for health, the doctor Druin Burch wrote in _Taking the Medicine_ that getting rid of smoking would be a greater net benefit to humanity than curing every type of cancer in the world. That would be an enormous example of progress by negation.

#### Less Is More

Modern society, corporations, and governments have a tendency to look for ever-more-complicated predictive models and solutions to the problems that they foresee. **However, this isn’t necessary—in fact, it’s actively harmful.**

Such models lead people to over-prepare for the wrong things (like when the predicted oil boom turned into an oil crash). At the same time, they completely miss the rare events that’ll have the greatest impact; the ones far out on the “significance” axis.

_Less is more_ is a common adage that’s remarkably easy to apply. Instead of relying on complex models and calculations to predict when and how problems will occur, just make sure that you’re prepared for when they inevitably do. For example, if you’re in business, don’t waste your effort trying to predict the next market downturn; simply ensure that you’ve got money set aside for when (not if) it happens.

**When there is a problem that needs to be solved, small-scale solutions can also have enormous effects if applied in the right places.** For instance, economist and author Bent Flyvbjerg once demonstrated that most corporate cost overruns are due to large-scale technology projects. Therefore, rather than obsessing over models and predictions, these corporations could easily just not take on such projects, thereby avoiding the financial hit.

“Less is more” can, and should, also be applied to making personal decisions. **If you need to make lists of reasons why you should do something, then you shouldn’t do it.** Something worth doing should only need a single, convincing reason. Similarly, people who talk themselves up with long biographies and lists of achievements should be avoided; if they’d done something worthwhile, they’d lead with that, and it would be enough to get your interest.

### Antifragility and Time

Antifragility, and the related concept of progress by negation, naturally lead to the conclusion that the old is stronger than the new. There’s a reason that we talk about things “standing the test of time.” Time is, in essence, random events. The more time passes, the more random events will happen. Fragile things will, sooner or later, be destroyed by randomness. **Therefore, things that survive for a long time must be durable or antifragile.**

The next time you eat a meal, think of how many discoveries and technologies go into making it possible and how ancient many of them are. Silverware has been saving our hands from getting greasy and burned since ancient Mesopotamia. Wine has existed for around 6,000 years and glasses to drink it from for around 3,000. The fire to cook the food is typically considered one of the earliest discoveries that humans ever made.

**Progress by negation is counterintuitive.** People tend to be drawn to the newest and shiniest things. If asked to imagine the future, they’ll think about what new technologies and discoveries might be present; rarely do they think about what _won’t_ survive the test of time.

Any number of science fiction novels prove this point. Such books are almost always about what’s new, not about what’s still there from the old days. Almost all of them envision a world that’s almost unrecognizable, instead of one that still closely resembles the time when the book was written—though admittedly, that may just be because it wouldn’t make for a very interesting story.

### The Opposite of Aging

Since the old is stronger than the new, it leads to another counterintuitive point—things that have survived for a long time already will outlast things that haven’t been around as long. People often overlook this fact for two reasons:

1. They try to apply the same logic that applies to perishable things, such as humans. You can be reasonably confident that a young human will outlive an old one; however, the same can’t be said for things without a hard limit on their lifetimes. For example, a Broadway show that’s run for a long time will most likely outlast a new show that just went up last week. **The older show has withstood the test of time, while the new one hasn’t.**
2. They believe that new things must be better than old things. This is incorrect for the reasons we’ve already discussed.

It’s true that individual items, or people, or many other things will break down over time. Even items we don’t usually think of as perishable, like cars or books, will eventually rust or rot and stop being usable. However, the ideas and technologies behind the automobile and the printed word are much older than any individual car or book, and they will survive much longer. **That’s not to say that all ideas and technologies are immortal—only that the ones most vulnerable to time are probably already dead.**

It’s also not to suggest that this holds true 100% of the time. Of course there are counterexamples: The Internet, which is newer than landline phones, seems likely to survive long past the time when the last phone cord is unplugged. The point is that, _on average_, things that have existed for a long time will outlive the newest fads.

A teacher named Paul Doolan once asked how he could teach children the skills they’d need in the 21st century, when he didn’t know which skills those would be. **In light of the reverse-aging effect, the best answer is to have them read the old classics; the future will be found in the past.**

### Neomania: Obsession With the New

In spite of antifragility all but ensuring that old ideas and techniques are better than new ones, many people seem to have an obsession with everything new. This obsession is called _neomania_.

One reason for neomania is that humans in general are highly aware of changes and differences. Someone whose phone was top-of-the-line a month ago might see people using sleeker models with slightly bigger screens and suddenly feel that her own (still perfectly good) phone is outdated and due to be replaced. **It’s not about the phone she has; it’s about the changes that have happened since she bought it.**

This constant desire to have the newest thing leads to what’s been called a _treadmill effect_. People feel an initial rush of joy when they buy the hot new thing. However, that joy fades quickly, and they grow bored with their new toys. Then a new model hits the market, and the cycle continues.

For some reason, people seem especially prone to neomania when it comes to gadgets, but not as much with things that we don’t consider to be “tech.” Someone who upgrades her television every chance she gets might have the same oil painting hanging next to it for years. She might sit on the same couch for decades and only replace it if it wears out—not because a new model with slightly larger arms showed up in the store.

**The reason for this could be related to fragility and antifragility.** Gadgets tend to be fragile, both literally and in the sense that they quickly become outdated and replaced by new tech. Many other items have some inherent antifragility, like designer shoes that only become comfortable after wearing them for a while.

#### Neomania in Science

**Scientific fields are especially prone to neomania.** That’s not surprising, given that much of science is devoted to finding new information, but the people touting each new discovery don’t take antifragility into account. Hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, many lauded as “visionary” or “groundbreaking,” end up just being so much background noise. Their exciting new ideas amount to nothing.

One disappointing example was the work of Judah Folkman, who was developing a new method to treat cancer. His theory was that, since cancer cells need a great deal of blood and tend to build new blood vessels to get it, one could cure cancer by simply cutting off the blood flow and starving the tumor. It looked brilliant on paper, but it had virtually no impact on cancer treatment. However, it did lead to new treatment methods for macular degeneration. **In a way, this is an example of both the fragility and antifragility of information.** When Folkman’s research was shiny and new, it amounted to nothing. However, over time, people found a different application for his work that was quite effective.

When it comes to science, we should apply the same rule of thumb as we do with any kind of technology or information: The old is, on average, better than the new. New innovations and theories are usually fragile, just waiting for a single piece of data that disproves them. **Only science that has withstood the test of time should be relied upon.**

That doesn’t just apply to science, but all kinds of information. You could take any high school or college textbook and flip to a random page; odds are that the information you find there is still relevant. However, if you looked up a conference from five years ago about the same topic, featuring all the heady young professionals of the day, chances are that there won’t be anything of interest there. Whatever they were discussing will have either become obsolete or irrelevant in the time since then.

### Predicting the Future

If the old will, most of the time, outlive the new, then what might the future look like? Presumably, much like the present. Perhaps there will be even more of the things that define our lives now: more books, more computers, more artisans and craftspeople (based on the assumption that they’ll outlive the modern obsession with cheap, mass-produced goods).

However, if we’re to progress by negation, then certain fragile things must be destroyed or weakened in the years to come. **Remember what makes something fragile: size, over-efficiency, and top-down leadership—which are inevitably based on flawed theories and models.** We’ll likely see the decline of major corporations, which are unusually vulnerable to random events as shown by the fragility graph. Powerful nation-states and centralized banks may still exist in name, but it’s likely that they’ll be severely weakened.

As with Fat Tony’s prediction of the oil crash, foresight is less about specific predictions and more about spotting vulnerability. In fact, that was the classical role of the prophet: not to look into the future, but to examine the present and issue warnings based on that. The future was more the domain of soothsayers and fortune-tellers—and the classical wisdom was not to listen to such people.

To branch into philosophy for a moment, consider the story of Empedocles’ dog. Someone asked the philosopher Empedocles why his dog seemed to prefer to always sleep on the same tile of his floor. Empedocles answered that there had to be some kind of match between the dog and the tile—something that couldn’t be measured or defined in any traditional way, but that was nonetheless real.

**It seems likely that there’s a similar sort of match between people and the parts of our culture that have survived the longest, like reading, writing, and possibly religion.** We may never understand it in a way that would satisfy Socrates’s obsession with definitions, but the test of time will reveal where that connection lies.
