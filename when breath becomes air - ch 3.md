## Chapter 3: Becoming Dr. Kalanithi, Neurosurgeon

The fourth year of medical school brought decisions about specialties. Many of my classmates were selecting less-intense specialties, those with better hours, more money, and less stress. In those specialities, the responsibility for life was low.

I opted to choose neurosurgery, one of the most demanding specialties there is. My decision was motivated by an experience I had witnessing a pediatric neurosurgeon discussing a child’s tumor with his parents. I listened as he transitioned from physician, detailing the medical implications, to companion, respecting the personal, moral implications and guiding them through their fears.

I saw how the parents, distraught and frightened, were able to find emotional stability and fortitude for the journey that lay ahead. I realized that life, death, and meaning were issues grappled with more often than not within the context of medicine, but beyond that, there were existential factors at play. The body is an organism that will eventually succumb to physical laws, but the meaning encompassed in that body takes on its own trajectory.

Thus, neurosurgeons treat not only the brain, but also the spirit of the person. Every procedure affects the organism and the identity, and this latter aspect must be considered. The judgment call required of the doctor, then, is not simply about whether the physical life can be saved. We must also contemplate the _quality_ of the life saved. Patients are confronted with the meaning of life, and doctors can help provide the facts to help them discover the answer.

This field would not only force me to confront the questions I’d been asking since undergrad, but also place me squarely in the space where the answers could be found.

### A Different Kind of Education

Lucy and I were married and shortly moved to California to begin our residences. I was back at Stanford to begin the first of seven years of training. I quickly formed relationships with other residents: Victoria, who was at the same point as I was, and Jeff, who had a few years under his belt.

At first, residency seemed to be about paperwork. There were never-ending papers that needed to be pushed here or there, and I didn’t leave the hospital for two days. But I quickly learned to get through the paperwork more efficiently, until the never-ending stack only took an hour.

It was on a Tuesday that my first patient died.

Mrs. Harvey was eighty-two years old and seemingly healthy. She underwent minor surgery to remove a blockage in her bowels, and I checked on her Monday night. I went home happy that she was awake and stable.

Later that night, I received a call and was told she was crashing. I blurted out a series of tests to run and hustled back to the hospital. Nothing I did seemed to make a difference. To compound the situation, I was constantly being paged as the only general surgery intern on duty. I was rushing back and forth between an ER patient in severe distress and Mrs. Harvey’s room. Around sunrise, the ER patient was taken to surgery, and Mrs. Harvey had stabilized.

Again, I left the hospital only to be called back. The doctors in the ICU were performing CPR, and Mrs. Harvey came around again. But an hour later, she died. I teetered between frustration and sorrow. Suddenly, Mrs. Harvey wasn’t just information on paper. She’d become my patient, and I’d lost her. I knew, in that moment, I would never see paperwork as something to rush through. I would see it for what it was: a representation of a person balanced between life and death.

I would experience many more deaths my first year of residency. Sometimes, I could manage all of it, taking it in as I took in everything else around me. Other times, the graveness of death became so heavy, I felt like I was drowning in the misery of it and the misery of all involved.

### Residency: Year Two

The surgical resident rotation was intense, and the schedule started to wear on me. We were working endless hours, sometimes one hundred a week, and it seemed like the work was never done.

Some couldn’t hack it. They crumbled from the pressure or didn’t know how to accept the culpability involved and left the program. The weight of the responsibility was immense, and as my skills improved, my responsibility increased. Determining the likelihood of survival was matched by the need to determine the viability of survival. Saving a patient meant saving the patient’s ability to not simply exist, but to live. Doing otherwise felt like a bigger catastrophe than death.

Neurosurgery was my avenue to understanding the intricacies of death as much as the connection between the brain and the mind. I’d thought being on the frontlines of death would change me, make me understand what it meant to live and begin living better. Certainly, if one is confronted with life and death decisions day in and day out, some sort of awakening must follow.

Instead, I started to wonder if my role as gatekeeper was normalizing the scenario. Or, perhaps, it was keeping me at a safe distance from the battle, like a general atop a horse on a hill. I was around death, near dying patients. I was there to witness their greatest moment of grief and suffering. But I wasn’t fighting next to them---just organizing and observing the fight. My life went on the same. I was forming relationships with others on the outskirts, bonding over our duties to the dying. I had found a way to adapt my baseline of normalcy to the environment around me.

This perspective became clear one night after a motorcycle trauma came into the ER. I was in the middle of “dinner”---an ice cream sandwich and soda. I stashed the items on the side of the trauma room and went to work.

It became clear the motorcycle patient would not survive, even if we could get him to surgery. After we pronounced him dead, I left the room. But a second later, I remembered my discarded dinner. I snuck back in and retrieved the items, saving the ice cream sandwich before it became a melted mess in front of the body that could not be saved. At that moment, I contemplated whether my morality had gotten lost amidst my professional acumen.

### Reclaiming My Humanity

Everything changed after the news of a friend’s death reached me. I’d known Laurie in medical school. She’d made it through surgery after being hit by a car but died the next day. I didn’t ask any questions or for any particulars about her case. The time when a car accident was just a car accident was gone. A car accident now conjured all the pictures I had in my head of procedures, processes, and possible injuries that would lead to death. I had all the information I needed as a doctor to understand Laurie’s death. I understood it as I would any other patient.

Each moment that I had failed to recognize the patients I saw as people, as priorities, as suffering individuals worthy of empathy and focused care, flooded my mind. I had moved through patients’ pain, worries, and diagnoses like a worker on a factory line. I felt crushing guilt. I had failed to recognize the significance of the situation and their lives. I was turning into Tolstoy’s cliche of a doctor: mechanically treating disease without noticing the individual.

Human relationality was once of great importance to me, but I had forgotten it amid the harried world of diagnosis and prognosis. It wasn’t sufficient to just be an excellent surgeon. I had to be an excellent physician, which meant guiding those in my care, including families, to a place where tragedy can be comprehended.

This role, the pastoral one, became my highest priority, for often the families are equally blinded to delicate facets of life and death. They look at their sick or injured loved one and see the person they were, the life they lived, and the memories they shared. It was a sight of the past, whereas I understood the realities of the future.

I could use this knowledge to help these families understand that, with severe brain trauma, the body in front of them no longer contained that image from the past. The questions were all about the future: whether their loved one could have one and whether they should. Because only the family knows for certain if a dramatically altered quality of life would be worth it, or whether death would be preferred. It was their decision, and I wanted to serve as an usher to help them make it.

### A New Kind of Doctor

In this new role, I no longer spewed risks and statistics like an auctioneer. I became a sort of ambassador or companion. I met the patients and families at the apex of their grief and provided what I could to help them see the best way through it.

I was taking full ownership of every aspect of my patients’ care by this point. I thought about my father and the way he fostered trust and real connection with his patients. I was motivated to do the same.

I felt this type of work was particularly important for the neurosurgeon, because brain injuries, more than most, confound reason. The body can still be alive with the help of machines---the chest still moving up and down, blood still circulating---even when the patient is brain-dead. Death with a beating heart is not an easy concept to take in.

I had come to understand two things about informing patients of diagnoses and prognoses. First, statistics have no place in the doctor-patient relationship. And second, being honest about the gravity of the situation is necessary, but so is allowing for hope. For these reasons, I determined that approaching diagnoses a spoonful at a time was the best way forward.

For instance, a patient was referred to me after an MRI, but no one had informed her what the results showed. Doctors often push the task of delivering hard news to another. I would not be that kind of doctor, not anymore at least.

I could tell right away from the scan that this woman had an aggressive form of brain cancer. I was careful when delivering the news, allowing the emotional states of the woman and her husband to guide my words. As soon as they heard the words “brain cancer,” they would likely not hear anything else.

Human relationality requires honesty, but honesty doesn’t mean overwhelming patients with a giant bolus of mortality. It is not uncommon for patients and families to tune out and lose their tongues after receiving bad news. At these moments, all there is to do is take their hand and guide them as far as they can go until they’re ready for more.

Yet, making human relationality a priority was difficult, and doing so had consequences. Meeting patients in the foggy space between the past and future was emotionally taxing. I didn’t realize how much so until I was driving home one night in my third year and realized I was crying. But still, I never questioned the work or the value in it. The call to be a neurosurgeon---as it is a calling---is a virtuous endeavor, not simply because of the lives we are able to save, but because of the identities we are tasked to maintain.

Before any surgical procedure was performed, I needed to get a sense of that person’s identity. I needed to know their mind, what they valued, what they lived for, what they could live without, and what they couldn’t. Taking on that burden is a costly venture, for success in surgery is not guaranteed. And in those moments, the ones where we fail, the guilt is immeasurable.
