## Part 1: Philosophy | Adopt an Empowering Worldview

Life can sometimes feel like an endless string of problems and setbacks. But what if it didn’t have to be this way? What if, instead of exhausting you and dampening your spirits, every challenge you faced made you tougher and more energized? In _The Obstacle Is the Way,_ Ryan Holiday argues that you have the power to create this kind of life for yourself by changing the way you view your problems.

Holiday explains that choosing to view obstacles in an empowering way is a major tenet of an ancient philosophy called Stoicism, founded in Greece in the third century B.C. _The Obstacle Is the Way_ is a Stoic’s guide to solving problems, outlining the principles that heroes throughout history used to exert their will over a hostile world.

According to Holiday, people throughout history have chosen to follow the Stoic tradition and utilized the same empowering strategy to solve their problems: **They find the hidden opportunity in any misfortune and use it as a tool to accomplish their chosen goal.** This philosophy has enabled people from every walk of life to overcome enormous obstacles and transform themselves into stronger, nobler people in the process.

This guide will teach you the tenets of Stoic problem-solving and how to apply them to the problems in your life. Part 1 will be “Philosophy,” explaining the basics of how Stoics view the world and the purpose of life—ideas that Holiday calls “The Discipline of Perception.”

In Parts 2 and 3, we’ll explore specific strategies rooted in Stoicism that you can use to solve your problems. Part 2 will be “The Internal Fight,” strategies to master your emotional state that Holiday refers to as “The Discipline of Will.” Part 3 will be “The External Fight,” strategies to efficiently accomplish your goals in the real world that Holiday refers to as “The Discipline of Action.”

> **Is This Really Stoicism?**
> 
> [It’s a point of contention](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/27/sorry-silicon-valley-heres-why-you-cant-actually-be-a-stoic-nowadays/?sh=162d11a2764c) whether or not _The Obstacle Is the Way_ and other pop-Stoic texts truly fit into the Stoic canon. _The Obstacle Is the Way_ [doesn’t claim to be a replacement for the original Stoic texts](https://dailystoic.com/obstacle-is-the-way-summary/) or even to comprehensively summarize them—Holiday prefers to label it as a book “inspired by” Stoicism rather than one that’s “about” Stoicism. This qualifying statement begs the question: **How faithful are the ideas in this book to the original Stoic teachings?**
> 
> There’s no single founding document of Stoicism, making it difficult to pin down precisely what the philosophy represents. _The Obstacle Is the Way_ is most directly based on _[Meditations, a philosophical treatise by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/1-page-summary)_. _Meditations,_ along with other Roman Stoic texts, focused far more on the ethics of Stoic philosophy and their applications to daily living than the original Greek Stoic writings, which focused more on observation and classification of the universe. Holiday writes in the tradition of the Roman Stoics, adamant that Stoic philosophy is meant to be applied.
> 
> Many [ideas common across Stoic writings](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/) are present in _The Obstacle Is the Way_. Stoics across the board agreed that virtue is both the purpose of life and the greatest source of fulfillment. Through self-discipline, a “sage” can transform their life by becoming undisturbed by external events and learning to control irrational passions—two ideas that contribute to our modern concept of the word “stoic.”
> 
> Holiday’s faithfulness to Stoic writing doesn’t stop there. The three disciplines that form the backbone of Holiday’s book—perception, action, and will—originated in _[Discourses](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304102/discourses-and-selected-writings-by-epictetus/)_ by Epictetus, another Roman Stoic text that directly influenced Marcus Aurelius. These specific English names were coined by Gregory Hays in the introduction to his translation of _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/1-page-summary)_.
> 
> Holiday doesn’t cover every main idea of Stoicism, however. He’s left out most of the philosophy’s metaphysical, pseudo-religious beliefs, likely because he wants to appeal to a broad secular audience. For example, one central tenet of Stoicism is a belief in _logos_, a rational godlike force at work creating an ordered universe—and a force that Holiday doesn’t mention. Additionally, Holiday emphasizes how you can use Stoicism to _get what you want out of life_ by amending your approach to problems; however, [some argue that this approach undercuts the power of “true” Stoicism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/27/sorry-silicon-valley-heres-why-you-cant-actually-be-a-stoic-nowadays/?sh=162d11a2764c), which denies the need for material gain and puts greater emphasis on virtuous living.
> 
> Holiday would likely make the case that while _The Obstacle Is the Way_ doesn’t paint a complete picture of the Stoic worldview, it doesn’t necessarily contradict it, either. As Holiday himself put it, [“Stoicism is a philosophy designed for the masses, and if it has to be simplified a bit to reach the masses, so be it.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/fashion/ryan-holiday-stoicism-american-apparel.html)

We’ve divided Part 1, our discussion of the Stoic worldview, into three basic truths. These truths are Holiday’s foundational beliefs about the world that lead him to conclude that you can (and should) transform any problem into an opportunity that benefits you.

### Truth #1: No Event Is Necessarily Good or Bad

In our everyday lives, we assign meaning to everything that happens to us, judging events to be either good or bad. Holiday explains that in contrast, Stoics view events neutrally—that is, they observe only the facts of any given situation, without judgment.

In Holiday’s eyes, the positive or negative judgments we make about the events in our lives are nothing more than illusions—they’re often detached from reality. We invent narratives of cause and effect that aren’t true, convincing ourselves that external occurrences have far greater power over us than they really do.

Holiday argues that in reality, **these subjective judgments themselves are what cause much of our suffering**. Instead of seeing things as they are, we perceive problems that aren’t really there, which is the real problem. When things don’t turn out the way we think they should, we assume that we’re doomed to suffer, which frightens and disempowers us. However, this forecasted suffering never has to come to pass. [As the Stoic philosopher Seneca put it](https://dailystoic.com/seneca-quotes/), we suffer more often in imagination than in reality. By simply learning to see these events objectively, as neither good nor bad, we spare ourselves a great deal of pain.

For example, imagine you hear a rumor that the company you work for is operating at a loss and several employees need to be fired. You fear you’re going to lose your job and begin to panic. Holiday would argue that **the risk of getting fired isn’t the problem—your warped, negative view of the situation, causing fear and panic, is the problem**. This rumor isn’t necessarily an unfortunate turn of events: You don’t know that it’s true, or that you would be one of the employees fired.

Even if you are fired, there’s a chance you might immediately find a better job, and getting fired will have been one of the best things to ever happen to you. By fearing the worst, you’re suffering unnecessary emotional stress that makes it more difficult to work toward a solution.

Seeing events objectively, as Stoics see them, doesn’t come naturally—Holiday frames it as a skill you need to intentionally hone. Whenever you catch yourself lamenting over your own misfortune, stop and remind yourself that _there’s no such thing as misfortune_. Later, we’ll explore some specific strategies to help you do this.

> **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Is About Cultivating Objectivity**
> 
> Holiday’s claim that subjective perceptions cause most of our suffering has significant support from the field of psychology. In the popular branch of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy, or “CBT,” a patient and therapist work together to identify the patient’s harmful and inaccurate perceptions of reality; replace them with healthier, more realistic beliefs; and build habits of responding to negative emotions in constructive ways.
> 
> In _[Feeling Great](https://catalog.pesi.com/item/feeling-great-68964)_, psychiatrist David Burns explains that people who suffer from anxiety and depression experience the types of distorted, irrational negative thoughts that Holiday mentions. For example, they overgeneralize, telling themselves that because they did one thing wrong, they are “bad people” doomed to make things worse for the rest of their lives. Or, they “discount the positive,” devaluing their successes and claiming that they don’t really count. Burns agrees with Holiday that seeing things objectively is a trainable skill, and for this reason, [he offers readers many exercises to help them perceive events without judgment.](https://feelinggood.com/2018/06/18/093-fifty-ways-in-fifty-minutes-part-1/)
> 
> The success of cognitive behavioral therapy in clinical settings supports Holiday’s argument about the power of perspective. A meta-analysis of over a hundred independent studies found that [cognitive behavioral therapy is indeed effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584580/), especially in treating anxiety disorders, stress disorders, bulimia, and problems with anger control.

#### Even Death Isn’t Necessarily Bad

Stoics believe that _no_ situation is objectively good or bad, _without exception_. This includes the condition that many see as the universal curse of humanity: our own mortality. Holiday argues that **the reality that we’re going to die someday—perhaps even today—is a neutral fact, like anything else, that we can choose to interpret however we wish**.

Holiday points out that the fact we’re going to die actually offers us a number of benefits, as long as we see the situation objectively enough to notice and claim them. An awareness that our days are numbered actually makes many things easier for us—we’re more readily grateful for the good things we have in life, and we’re motivated to pursue what we truly think is important instead of wasting time living an unfulfilled life. These are gifts we wouldn’t have if not for our own mortality—which, according to Holiday, proves that death itself is not necessarily a bad thing. Like everything else in our lives, it’s a neutral fact of life.

> **We Didn’t Always Fear Death**
> 
> In _[Antifragile](https://shortform.com/app/book/antifragile)_, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that [humans in modern society fear death far more than they did back in classical antiquity](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/antifragile/chapters-21-22). He asserts that before the Enlightenment, the average person’s goal wasn’t to avoid death but to die in a noble way that accomplished something for future generations—for example, to die in battle defending your nation, or to leave behind a business that will help your children live a better life. This supports Holiday’s argument that, given the right perspective, even a situation as grim as your own death can be something worth celebrating.
> 
> Taleb advocates for a return to this collective-minded attitude toward death. In his eyes, our focus on our own lives as an end goal causes our society to be more fragile. For example, by accruing governmental debt and depleting natural resources, we’re enriching ourselves at the expense of future generations, damaging the human race as a whole. Instead of trying to live longer, we should be trying to live purposefully, die, and make room for others.

### Truth #2: You Can Choose to See Every Problem as an Opportunity

Holiday argues that if you can find a way to use your own mortality as a means to improve your life, you can do the same with any other problem. The cornerstone of the Stoics’ problem-solving philosophy is that **you can find a silver lining in any circumstance in your life**, no matter how dire it seems. Even if the only benefit you can find in an obstacle is an opportunity to practice acting virtuously, for instance, by restraining your anger or forgiving a misdeed, you’ve gained something of value.

Once you identify the upsides of a situation, Holiday claims that you can choose to be grateful that it happened. In short, **no event is inherently good or bad—your perspective determines whether it’s good or bad.** By choosing to claim the gift available in any problem, you remove its ability to hurt you.

Holiday makes it clear that this isn’t an empty truism promising that positive thinking will keep anything bad from ever happening to you. Rather, it means that **failures and setbacks can be just as good for you as getting what you want—if you decide to see them that way**.

Here are a few examples of how problems could become opportunities:

- **If a friend borrows a great deal of money and refuses to repay you**, you can learn not to rely on them for even more important things, such as taking care of your children. Or, in a future time of need, you may be able to convince them that they owe you a favor. If nothing else, it can be an opportunity for you to practice feeling less attached to money and other material possessions.
- **If you get dumped by a long-term romantic partner**, the longstanding issues and arguments you two were struggling to resolve no longer have to impede your path toward an ideal relationship. You have an opportunity to find someone new, with whom you’re even more compatible. Being single might be a powerful motivator to improve yourself—to practice self-reflection or start exercising again. Plus, you’ll have more time to pursue your hobbies and refine your sense of self.
- **If you’re heartbroken by the death of a grandparent**, you can use the tragedy as a reminder to treasure the time you still have with your parents. Shared grief may bring you closer to your emotionally distant siblings. You could even use this event as a reminder of your own death and start living life to the fullest.

In situations like these, you don’t need to deny the fact that you would rather things had turned out differently. However, Holiday argues that if you refuse to look for their hidden benefits, you’re actively throwing away a gift that’s been given to you. **Every negative event contains gifts like these for you to find.**

#### Seeing Your Problems as Opportunities Helps You Overcome Them

Another reason it’s so empowering to choose to see your problems as gifts is that **your perception of a situation determines how you will respond to it**. Holiday argues that if you see your problems as opportunities, you’ll be more likely to persevere through setbacks and discover hidden solutions. In this way, what you tell yourself about an obstacle significantly influences how easy or difficult it is to overcome.

Often, we blame someone or something else for our unpleasant situation, convincing ourselves that there’s nothing we can do to get unstuck. Holiday asserts that on the contrary, **the only thing that can ever keep us stuck is our subjective perception of the situation**. If you decide there’s nothing you can do, the obstacle you confront will indeed be insurmountable. On the other hand, if you believe that there’s a way forward in any situation, you’ll find it wherever it exists.

> **The Right Perspective Makes People “Lucky”**
> 
> Holiday argues that you can bring a positive attitude to any situation, but how exactly does it help you overcome your problems? Over several years, psychologist Richard Wiseman [conducted a study to determine what separates lucky people from unlucky people](http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/The_Luck_Factor.pdf). After examining and experimenting with hundreds of people who described themselves as either “exceptionally” lucky or unlucky, he found that the difference was entirely behavioral and had much to do with the subjects’ perspective on life events.
> 
> One of the chief differences between lucky and unlucky people was the way they practiced “counterfactual thinking”—wondering about alternative ways past events could have happened. Unlucky people dwelled on ways things could have gone better, while lucky people felt gratitude that things hadn’t gone worse—in essence, **lucky people practiced Holiday’s suggestion to focus only on the upside of any negative situation**.
> 
> Specifically, Wiseman asked subjects to imagine that they were at a bank during a robbery and wound up getting shot in the arm. While unlucky people labeled this as an unlucky situation, mourning that they happened to be in the bank when this crime occurred, lucky people classified this as a lucky situation, noting that they could have easily been shot in the head and feeling grateful that they survived. By comparing situations to worse alternatives, they were able to recontextualize any situation into something positive, proving Holiday’s assertion that every situation carries some benefit.
> 
> Wiseman found that this “downward counterfactual thinking” not only makes lucky people feel happier about their lives, **but it also makes them more optimistic, and consequently, more receptive to future opportunities.** Wiseman asked subjects to count the number of photographs in a newspaper, but he placed a large note on the second page that gave the answer away. The lucky people, who approached the task in a relaxed, open way, were much more likely to see the note than unlucky people, who were too focused on the job they were given to see the opportunity staring them in the face.
> 
> This illustrates in greater detail how a pessimist overwhelmed by negative events may falsely conclude that they’re trapped by circumstance, as Holiday describes—your perspective limits the opportunities you see. In contrast, Wiseman’s lucky subjects, primed to take advantage of positive opportunities, were more likely to stumble into romantic success and promotions at work. As Holiday would predict, their optimistic perceptions determined how they responded to life events, even problems, making their lives demonstrably “luckier.”

### Truth #3: The Purpose of Life Is to Act on Opportunities

In Holiday’s eyes, we have a moral obligation to live as virtuous a life as possible. A virtuous person, by Holiday’s definition, is someone who honestly works to improve their life and the lives of others as much as possible. With this in mind, he argues that **pursuing virtue is the most fulfilling thing you can do with your life**. Holiday asserts that virtuous action _can_ and _should_ be our source of pride—the motivating energy that makes us happy to be alive.

To this end, **the ability to find opportunities within a problem is necessary to live a virtuous life.** When you see obstacles as opportunities, they lose the power to upset you or diminish your motivation to live virtuously. In contrast, whenever you fail to see the opportunity in any problem, you have an excuse not to act. According to Holiday, we’ve all used these excuses at some point to avoid our responsibility to live virtuously. In doing so, we deprive ourselves of the forward momentum necessary to live a good life.

Holiday argues that even if your current task seems insignificant in the grand scheme of things, or you end up failing miserably, the long-term pursuit of virtue will fulfill you. If you’re constantly trying your hardest to improve the lives of yourself and others, every task is meaningful.

> **The Benefits of Living Virtuously**
> 
> Holiday expands on why he believes a life of virtue is so important in his book _[Stillness Is the Key](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/591652/stillness-is-the-key-by-ryan-holiday/9780525538585)_, the third in his trilogy on Stoic philosophy. While he reiterates that morally, we should live our lives as virtuously as possible, he focuses more on the fact that **virtue benefits the one practicing it.**
> 
> While Holiday expresses in _The Obstacle Is the Way_ that you need the ability to see the opportunities within problems to live virtuously, in _Stillness Is the Key_ he emphasizes the reverse: **Living virtuously _ensures_ that you’ll see opportunities in any situation.** When you define success as a virtuous life, you’ll never be stuck or disappointed, because there’s always an opportunity to practice virtue.
> 
> A life without virtue is stressful, unfulfilling, and exhausting, as every decision requires you to calculate possible outcomes and fear you won’t get what you want. In contrast, making your decisions based on virtue gives you peace, as practicing virtue is fulfilling in itself, even if things don’t turn out the way you hoped. Virtue pays off the most in difficult moments—you can be certain and feel proud about living virtuously when there’s nothing else to feel certain or proud about.
