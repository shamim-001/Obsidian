## Shortform Introduction

What does it say about us that this book is so popular?

Well, we might be existentially aimless--apparently millions of people are so preoccupied with the question “what is the meaning of life?” that they seek out this book.

This book has existed in many forms. The first part, “Experiences in a Concentration Camp,” was first published as a standalone narrative about Viktor Frankl’s experiences in 4 different concentration camps during World War II. Other books have covered the horrors, indiginities, and abuse that concentration camp prisoners suffered during WWII from an emotional standpoint. But what about the psychology of those prisoners? Frankl set out to write a book that **analyzed the mindset of the average concentration camp prisoner** and how it reflected, adapted to, and either succumbed to or transcended beyond the torments of the camps. He wanted the book to serve as concrete proof that **humans can find meaning under any conditions**, even the most horrific.

In the narrative, Frankl briefly touches on some principles from his own school of psychology, logotherapy. After its publication, two things happened: the narrative was a big success, and people wanted to know more about logotherapy after reading it. First, Frankl added a very short section on logotherapy, but people still wrote to him for more information. So this edition, published in 1992, had a much more extended section on the therapeutic doctrine.

However, in his career Frankl wrote twenty full volumes in German on logotherapy. Therefore, this summary and even the original book are just a high-level overview of logotherapy, its philosophy and its practices.

The original book is split up into parts I and II, without any further organization. For clarity, we’ve reorganized the content by theme and broken the book down into smaller chapters.

- Part I in the book corresponds to our chapters 1 and 2. First, we’ll go through the psychological phases a concentration camp prisoner went through and the psychological symptoms they suffered in those phases. Then, we’ll discuss how prisoners overcame or resisted those phases.
- Part II in the book corresponds to our chapters 3-6. We’ll learn about meaning, how to find it, some philosophical challenges in seeking meaning, and some concrete tips from logotherapy to combat anxiety.
