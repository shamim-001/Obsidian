## Chapter 1: The Ground Book—Fundamental Principles of the Way

_The Book of Five Rings_ presents legendary Samurai Miyamoto Musashi’s (1584-1645) strategies for following the true Way of ancient Japanese swordsmanship, so that anyone diligent and committed enough can become an undefeated champion. **For a Samurai like Musashi, combat was frequently a kill-or-be-killed situation, somewhat similar in this respect to the gladiatorial combats of Ancient Rome.** For an aspiring warrior at the time this was written, learning the true Way was not just a matter of personal achievement, but also a matter of personal survival.

The work is divided into five “books” or chapters, each named after a different natural element important in Buddhism: ground, water, fire, wind, and what Musashi calls “the Void.” The Ground Book lays out the fundamental principles of Musashi’s Way; the Water Book focuses upon cultivating the right physical and mental approach to combat; the Fire Book is about fighting, both in one-to-one combat and in battles between armies; the Wind Book contains Musashi’s criticisms of other martial arts schools; and the Book of the Void is a brief Zen-like meditation on how to achieve the right spiritual state for a successful warrior.

> **The Five Rings of Japanese Swordsmanship**
> 
> As explained in this article by leading martial arts magazine _Black Belt_, [the five “rings” mentioned in Musashi’s title are a metaphorical representation of the five main areas of study in Japanese swordsmanship](https://blackbeltmag.com/samurai-training-toshishiro-obata-and-the-five-rings-of-shinkendo-japanese-swordsmanship). The five main areas are:
> 
> - **Suburi** is the area of basic exercises for both body (e.g. movement, posture, balance) and weapon (the basic moves of swordsmanship), to establish the fundamentals of the discipline.
>     
> - **Goho Battoho** covers the five main methods for moves during combat (horizontal, thrust, right-to-left diagonal, left-to-right-diagonal, rising cut).
>     
> - **Tanren Kata** covers transitions and more advanced combat moves. Body work is also included to improve aspects such as muscle memory and balance.
>     
> - **Tachiuch**i covers the exercises performed with a partner instead of solo drills.
>     
> - **Tameshigiri** is when the aspiring swordsman begins to use a real sword and engage in actual combat with an opponent. It is the culmination of his training.
>     

##### Musashi’s Key Themes

While _The Book of Five Rings_ can be difficult to follow and repetitious, a handful of themes recur throughout the five books:

- **The importance of a student-centric approach.** Each Samurai must learn to _absorb_ instead of memorizing principles of strategy and must find his own connection to the Way. Musashi can only offer general principles; it is up to the student to meditate upon them, search tirelessly for their true meaning, and apply them to his own life.
- **The body/mind connection as crucial for success.** The body and mind must be thoroughly disciplined and trained to be in sync with one another. In achieving total self-control through mastering body and mind, the Samurai can face any situation and defeat any enemy.
- **The superiority of knowledge and strategy over luck or natural ability.** Musashi claims that it wasn’t until age 30 that he began to take strategy seriously. He didn’t know how or why he had achieved his victories up until that point, but he became engrossed in trying to discover the secret to strategy—the true Way—afterward. **Musashi believes that true success is about training and application, _not_ about relying on circumstances or innate gifts.** Although Musashi doesn’t say so explicitly, the implication seems to be that natural ability or luck is unpredictable and therefore unreliable, while strategy can be learned and used at any time deemed necessary. For this reason, relying on strategy is a far stronger guarantee of victory.

(Shortform Note: While Musashi believed that commitment and training are more important for success than being lucky or naturally gifted, there is some evidence that [modern employers demonstrate a “natural talent” bias when selecting job candidates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amymorin/2016/11/06/hard-work-or-natural-talent-study-reveals-what-impresses-hiring-managers-the-most/?sh=5b22c38d34df). This suggests that, for the modern reader, recognizing and openly acknowledging your natural talents can still give you a competitive edge in your career, instead of relying too much on work ethic alone.)

- **The centrality of an “all or nothing” mindset.** Musashi advocates total dedication to one’s chosen art. For a historical Samurai, combat was typically a kill-or-be-killed situation, and Musashi’s attitude reflects this. Musashi frequently emphasizes how essential it is to dedicate yourself _completely_ to learning your art, practicing it, and believing in your own invincibility.

> **Sun Tzu’s Five Factors for Effective Warfare**
> 
> In _[The Art of War](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-war)_, Sun Tzu builds his theory of effective combat upon a series of core principles, just as Musashi does. However, while Musashi tends to favor a strategy built purely upon winning, Tzu shows a greater interest in the nuances of the ethical and social sides of combat. Tzu also aims his advice at armies, whereas Musashi’s principles are designed mostly for one-to-one Samurai combat.
> 
> Tzu claims that successful warfare depends on the general always keeping the following five factors in mind:
> 
> - **The Moral Law.** By _moral law_, Tzu refers to the bond between subjects and their ruler. The subject owes their ruler unquestioning obedience and will fight to the death in defense of their ruler and homeland if ordered to do so. This factor is reminiscent of the loyalty to Lord or Emperor that was an essential part of the Samurai creed.
>     
> - **Heaven.** This factor includes all of the natural climatic elements that can affect warfare, such as temperature and seasons of the year.
>     
> - **Earth.** The “earth” factor refers to on-the-ground factors such as the condition of the terrain for battle and the distances involved. In _The Book of Five Rings_, Musashi also discusses the importance of examining your terrain and planning your combat strategy accordingly in Book 3, the Fire Book.
>     
> - **The Commander.** For Tzu, a commander embodies the moral values all great leaders should have, such as wisdom, bravery, and discipline. In the _Book of Five Rings’_ Water Book, Musashi briefly discusses the importance of the Samurai demonstrating self-control to be a strong leader in combat.
>     
> - **Method and Discipline.** Tzu considers anything logistical to fall under this category, such as how the army is organized and how funds are managed. Musashi doesn’t say much about logistics in _The Book of Five Rings_—his focus is always more on the warrior at an individual level, instead of the technicalities of managing large-scale operations.
>     

The first book, the Ground Book, introduces the reader to some of the most important aspects of Musashi’s Way. The Way is, in essence, the strategy that a warrior must follow in order to be successful. In the Ground Book, these core fundamentals can be grouped into three categories:

1. The importance of **thoroughly knowing your discipline** before you begin practicing it
2. Developing the understanding of **how best to use the tools and resources** at your disposal
3. Having flexibility of mind, and **cultivating patience and commitment** in achieving your goal.

We will now take a closer look at each fundamental below.

### 1. Learn and Train Before Application

For Musashi, the foundation of effective strategy lies in first establishing a thorough knowledge of your discipline. Developing genuine knowledge of your discipline depends on two factors:

**1. You are responsible for your own development and learning.** Although Musashi mentions having his own school for aspiring Samurai and writes _The Book of Five Rings_ to explain the Way to others, he nevertheless believes that it is up to each individual to take charge of his own learning. He uses the metaphor of the needle and thread to explain his reasoning: The teacher is the needle, but it is the student, as the thread, who must find a way through the needle in developing and applying his knowledge. In other words, the teacher can facilitate learning, but it is _the student’s responsibility_ to put what he learns into practice.

> **Student-Centric Learning: Then and Now**
> 
> While [ideas around the importance of student-centric learning](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ938583.pdf) have gained increasing prominence in recent decades, versions of this approach have existed for many centuries. Socrates (470-399 BC) is perhaps the most famous example in the Western tradition. **The Socratic Method was rooted in the idea that the teacher should only guide the student**, usually through asking a series of thoughtful questions, leading the student to develop his own ideas and draw his own conclusions. Some modern pedagogues argue for [the benefits of applying a reformed Socratic Method within contemporary disciplines](https://jle.aals.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1289&context=home).
> 
> There are also current pedagogical methods aimed at creating student-centric learning even for very young children, such as [the Montessori Method](https://mindsplain.com/montessori-method/), which takes as one of its founding principles the idea of “autoeducation.” “Autoeducation” means that the child is encouraged to be an independent learner by having the freedom to develop their own interests and abilities, with the teacher offering individualized guidance and support instead of just a one-size-fits-all curriculum that all students must follow.

**2. You must thoroughly know the ways of your art before you can put it into effective practice**. The aspiring warrior must seek to know every aspect of his art, from technique to weaponry to achieving the right state of body and mind, before he is ready for combat. Musashi repeatedly warns that this is not a quick or easy process: he urges his reader to meditate deeply and slowly on what he has written and to tirelessly study “day and night,” as Musashi himself claims to have done for decades.

> **Mastering New Skills**
> 
> Some modern life coaches echo Musashi’s idea that mastery is usually more about application than innate ability. Such coaches argue that what really separates masters from amateurs is the amount of time and commitment shown to both gaining the right knowledge and putting that knowledge into practice. Here are [the eight steps for mastering a new craft or skill:](https://www.kforce.com/articles/how-to-become-a-master-of-your-craft/)
> 
> - **Commit to something specific.** Narrow in on the skill you wish to have and give it your full attention. Don’t try to master more than one serious skill at a time.
>     
> - **Play the long game.** Learn to think in terms of long-term success instead of shortcuts. Be patient during setbacks.
>     
> - **Take action.** Lay out a reasonable plan of action and stick to it. Remember that reaching a goal means putting in the time and effort consistently.
>     
> - **Seek mentorship.** Guidance from a coach or mentor can be invaluable in helping you develop your new skill. Be prepared to accept advice and correction gracefully.
>     
> - **Lean on your support network.** Surround yourself with people who believe in your goals and who will share their positive energy with you.
>     
> - **Channel your passion.** You need to foster a strong sense of purpose to get yourself through all the challenging times. Strive to be self-motivated and self-disciplined.
>     
> - **Find inspiration.** Read about people who have achieved things you admire, and try to learn from their example.
>     
> - **Keep practicing.** Don’t slack off when you think you’re getting good—keep right on practicing and perfecting your skill to not just achieve mastery, but _maintain_ it!
>     

### 2. Use the Right Tools and Resources

Musashi writes that **the true warrior is aware of _all_ of the resources available to him, and strategizes accordingly**. These resources include tools, such as different swords and other forms of weaponry, and the different abilities warriors have both individually and when working collectively as an army.

- **The warrior must become knowledgeable in different forms of weaponry and their uses.** The true warrior needs to be practical: He should always focus on use over decoration when choosing a weapon. Musashi also warns the warrior against becoming too reliant on any one weapon in particular—a true warrior knows how to win with _any_ weapon, and he does not pick favorites.
- **The warrior must assess which tools or resources are best for each combat.** Musashi compares the warrior to a carpenter when discussing the proper use of resources. Just as the carpenter must develop a thorough understanding of which tools and materials are available to him before he begins to build a house, so too must the warrior assess what is available and what is best to use in each situation.

> **Creating a “Life Resource” List**
> 
> **Musashi’s advice about knowing your resources and tools and making the best use of them requires being creative and flexible in discovering how best to use them to achieve your goals**. Similarly, today some life coaches advocate [creating a “life resource” list](https://blog.iqmatrix.com/life-resource-list) to help you figure out which resources you can use in whichever situation, personal or professional, you may find yourself in. A “life resource” list covers multiple areas, such as:
> 
> - **Mindset:** your personal qualities, beliefs, and feelings that you can draw upon to help achieve your goals, such as integrity, inner strength, and focus
>     
> - **Skills:** any talents or abilities you have that help you succeed in life, such as communication and interpersonal skills, self-discipline, time management, and so on
>     
> - **Support System:** your support system encompassing multiple categories, such as _personal_ (friends and family), _professional_ (colleagues, mentors), and _social_ (associations and organizations, e.g. clubs for your hobbies or religious institutions you attend)
>     
> - **Possessions:** anything you physically own or can readily access to support yourself, such as money, assets, investments, or tools
>     
> - **Knowledge:** information you have already absorbed and can refer to whenever you need it. It may be discipline-specific knowledge for your profession, language skills, or even facts about people, places, or contexts relevant to your goals
>     
> - **Information:** external resources such as books, articles, and any other form of media that can provide you with whatever further information you need for success
>     
> 
> See our exercise at the end of this chapter to brainstorm matching your resources to goals for more effective goal-setting.

- **The warrior must have an awareness of others’ abilities as well as his own.** If the warrior is a leader—like the carpenter as a worksite foreman—he must understand how best to make use of others’ abilities as well as his own in order to achieve victory.

> **Showing Team Leadership**
> 
> For the modern boss, Musashi’s advice about being aware of others’ abilities and knowing how to use them still applies. Many of [the top 10 traits of effective bosses](https://www.shortform.com/app/article/10-traits-of-a-perfect-boss-according-to-research-by-google-justin-bariso-insider) are linked to effective relationship-building with team members, including:
> 
> - **Treat problem-solving as an opportunity for coaching and mentoring.** An effective leader won’t just solve problems, she will also use problems as “teachable moments” for members of her team.
>     
> - **Know when to guide and when to give rein.** While the leader must provide explicit guidance and mentorship at times to her team, she will also give her team members the freedom to take initiative and discover things for themselves.
>     
> - **Lead by example.** The modern leader must model the work habits and professional attitude that she expects of her team members.
>     
> - **Communicate openly.** The effective leader will be consistent and clear in giving instructions and constructive feedback, and she’ll also be open to hearing her team members’ ideas, opinions, and concerns.
>     
> - **Be aware of each team member’s roles and duties.** The leader understands the role and duties of each team member in order to manage them effectively in achieving the company’s goals.
>     
> - **Motivate the team through awareness of common goals.** The modern leader unifies and motivates her team through clear common goals that they can achieve by working as an effective unit.
>     

### 3. Be Flexible, Patient, and Committed

#### Cultivate Mental Flexibility

While Mushashi emphasizes the importance of developing a deep knowledge of the warrior’s art first and foremost, he also argues that **in order to _apply_ this knowledge effectively, the warrior must develop flexibility of mind**. Flexibility of mind depends on the following habits:

- **Applying your knowledge and skills within different contexts.** Musashi warns against getting too comfortable with, or reliant upon, one particular setting when waging combat. The true warrior needs to know how to use his skills and knowledge equally well regardless of circumstances. Musashi also reminds his reader that “real world” applications of knowledge can look very different from the “textbook” treatment—this is why the warrior needs to be prepared to deal with any eventuality.

> **Identify and Use Your Transferable Skills**
> 
> Musashi’s advice to avoid becoming dependent on particular conditions or settings in order to succeed applies to today’s continuously evolving workplace. [Transferable skills are becoming increasingly valuable](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/transferable-skills/), especially since [the number of workers looking to switch their roles or industries has risen dramatically](https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/5-reasons-people-are-changing-careers-more-than-ever-before). An article by Forbes even argues that [workers who switch jobs frequently may be more successful in the long run](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/10/28/ten-reasons-successful-people-change-jobs-more-often/?sh=35617fe12eba) than those who remain within the same role or company long term.
> 
> With this in mind, it’s important to identify your transferable skills and how you could apply them within a new role or industry. Begin by making a three-columned chart to help organize your experiences and what you have gained from them. In the first column, write down an experience or responsibility you have had. In the second column, list the qualities or skills the experience required. In the third column, identify which of those qualities or skills could be transferred to a different role or situation.
> 
> For additional help in identifying your transferable skills:
> 
> - Ask a friend or mentor which skills or abilities they think you have. Ask them to provide examples of when you demonstrated those skills.
>     
> - Review your CV. What key words or terms do you keep mentioning, e.g. reliable, attention to detail, interpersonal skills?
>     
> - Consult a [transferable skills checklist](https://www.ramapo.edu/careercenter/files/2013/05/Page-7-8-Transferable-Skills-Checklist.pdf), many of which are freely available online to help get you brainstorming.
>     

- **Paying attention to the smallest things as well as the biggest things.** True knowledge lies in knowing _everything_ of relevance, no matter how minor it may seem. Musashi makes several cryptic comments about how what is small is large, and what is large is small. One interpretation could be that “small” and “large” are often _matters of perspective_: What might be a minor factor in one situation could be a much more crucial factor in another, depending on circumstances.

> **Dealing With Details More Effectively**
> 
> Learning how to become more detail-oriented and better at spotting the little things that matter takes time and practice. You can learn [how to be more detail-oriented at work](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/become-detail-oriented)—for example, by reading instructions carefully, taking time to check over work before submitting it, and finding ways to break big goals down into smaller steps.
> 
> However, while Musashi argues that _everything_ is relevant in some way, be it large or small, this is not always practical today. Learning how to prioritize is crucial for time management and effective goal-setting, and this means learning how to separate what is important or relevant from what is less so. [The analogy of rocks, pebbles, and sand can be useful in learning how to sort out tasks and details in order of importance.](https://mindfulpractices.us/2020/06/16/prioritizing-your-life-rocks-pebbles-sand/) The analogy works by showing how fitting all of the rocks, pebbles, and sand in a jar is a matter of knowing which to add first and in what order. If you prioritize the wrong material, not everything will fit in the jar.

- **Recognizing that small things can become more dangerous or important than things that appear larger**, especially since small things are so easy to overlook or underestimate. Musashi uses the example of a large group of enemies compared to an individual one. While the large group might appear more threatening, it is nevertheless easy to spot, and a large group of combatants can’t change their position easily. An individual warrior, by contrast, is harder to spot, more nimble, and therefore more unpredictable. In this respect, an individual warrior can be more dangerous than many fighters working collectively.

> **Guerrilla Warfare: The Danger of Small Threats**
> 
> Musashi’s warning about an agile enemy or small force being sometimes more dangerous than a large army has particular relevance in recent history. In the latter half of the 20th century, [guerrilla warfare](https://www.britannica.com/topic/guerrilla-warfare/Strategy-and-tactics) became a particularly successful strategy used by small, under-equipped forces against much larger and more powerful armies. Some notable examples include:
> 
> - **The Viet Cong Communist forces that waged guerrilla warfare against the US** during [the Vietnam War](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/vietnam-war-history#:~:text=The%20Vietnam%20War%20was%20a,States%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union.) (1954-75). Although the US boasted one of the most powerful military forces in the world after WWII, the unrelenting guerrilla tactics of the Viet Cong led to the US spending enormous amounts of time, money, and personnel in Vietnam over nearly two decades, ultimately to no avail.
>     
> - **Fidel Castro ultimately seized power in Cuba from former President Fulgencio Batista**, after starting out with just a small band of guerrilla fighters during [the Cuban Revolution](https://www.history.com/topics/latin-america/cuban-revolution) (1953-59). Over roughly five years, Castro and his guerrillas used stealth, strategic military strikes, and constant movement throughout the Cuban countryside to harass the regime and slowly amass popular support for their cause.
>     
> - **Portugal lost the last territories of its former global empire after costly, protracted warfare against guerrillas in its African colonies.** In colonies such as Angola and Mozambique, nationalist guerrilla fighters waged relentless campaigns against the Portuguese colonial forces from 1961 until 1974. The [Colonial Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Colonial_War) became so unpopular in Portugal that they led to both the overthrow of Portugal’s Estado Novo dictatorship and the liberation of the African colonies in 1974.
>     

#### Develop Patience and Commitment

Musashi consistently emphasizes that **developing mastery in any discipline takes a great deal of time and perseverance**. His three main strategies for nurturing resilience and commitment are:

- **Recognize that beginnings are always difficult.** Just because something is hard to do now doesn’t mean that it will always be difficult. Musashi uses examples of various weapons to illustrate this point—no weapon is easy to wield at first, he points out. Over time, difficult tasks will become easier.

> **Build Your Resilience**
> 
> Developing resilience and a determined attitude toward achieving your goals are learnable with the right methods and mindset.
> 
> Here are some tips for boosting your resilience:
> 
> - **Get enough sleep.** Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to irritability, lack of focus, and less emotional control, all of which can impact your level of resilience. Keep a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at set times every day.
>     
> - **Manage your stress levels.** Feeling overwhelmed can make it harder to face challenges. You can learn [how to cope with stress](https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/2959/stress-2017.pdf) to help build resilience under pressure.
>     
> - **Set specific and realistic goals.** If you don’t know what you want to achieve, it can be harder to maintain momentum. Follow the SMART goal principle, setting goals that are: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ttainable, **R**ealistic, and **T**imely. Set a mix of both short-term and long-term goals so you can see how you are working toward larger objectives step-by-step.
>     
> - **Seek support.** Maintain emotional balance by reaching out to family, friends, and professional mentors whenever you need encouragement and advice. Sometimes resilience is a team effort.
>     

- **Undergo constant training.** Musashi writes about how he spent many long years completely absorbed in learning about his art and training himself in it. He expects the same of any other aspiring warrior. He repeatedly stresses how crucial it is to commit yourself to rigorous, constant training in order to develop true mastery in your chosen discipline.

> **The Importance of “Deliberate Practice”**
> 
> Habits coach James Clear advocates for [“deliberate practice” when adopting new skills and pursuing goals](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice). Deliberate practice is rooted in the idea that effective practice is, above all, _focused_ practice: You give your full attention to what you are doing, and seek to understand and perfect it. Because you’re applying sustained focus to the skill or habit you’re trying to develop, you’ll be able to spot your errors more easily and correct them. Clear argues that deliberate practice applies to any discipline, giving examples of success stories from fields as varied as cooking, writing, music, and sports.
> 
> This idea of deliberate practice is reminiscent of Musashi’s urging of constant, focused training, especially since Musashi considers deeply meditating upon each principle before practicing it to be a part of the process. Musashi wants the ideal warrior to learn and practice everything _mindfully_—or, as James Clear would say, deliberately.

- **Have an all-or-nothing attitude toward victory.** Musashi describes “the spirit of winning” as being absolutely committed to achieving your goal. He says that the warrior must be prepared to use any weapon and to deal with any obstacle. A singular focus on victory is essential.

> **Counterpoint: Sun Tzu Argues Against “Total” Victory**
> 
> Musashi’s attitude to victory is single-minded: Only winning matters, and completely subduing—or in the case of Samurai combat, killing—your enemy is the only victory worth having. Sun Tzu, by contrast, takes the opposite approach. In Book III of _[The Art of War](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-war)_, he argues that [total warfare is not always good or necessary](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sun-tzu/the-art-of-war/lionel-giles/text/chapter-6)_._ Instead, Tzu advocates the route of least possible damage: Kill as few of the enemy as possible, destroy as little of their lands and property as possible. He even claims that the highest form of military skill is gaining victory over your enemy _without having to fight at all_. Instead, you can thwart the enemy’s plans and rout him through your knowledge and superior strategy alone.
> 
> Furthermore, Tzu doesn’t share Musashi’s admiration for smaller forces that gain impressive victories over larger forces—Tzu advises avoiding such uneven matches in the first place, preferring to always be superior or equal to the enemy’s forces. If your forces are smaller in number, Tzu’s advice is unequivocal—avoid, or retreat.
> 
> The main difference between Musashi’s and Tzu’s approaches becomes readily apparent in such passages: Musashi’s Way embodies the grandeur and stylized violence of Samurai culture, while Tzu’s “arts of war” are more pragmatic.

##### Musashi’s 9 Principles

At the end of the Ground Book, **Musashi lists nine general principles for warriors wishing to learn the Way**. These principles are:

1. Be honest.
2. Train constantly.
3. Familiarize yourself with other arts.
4. Develop knowledge of other professions.
5. Learn to tell the difference between true loss and gain.
6. Develop intuitive judgment and understanding for everything.
7. Have perception as well as sight.
8. Be detail-oriented.
9. Be purposeful.

(Shortform note: Musashi doesn’t elaborate on these principles, or give specific advice on how or when the warrior can apply them during or after training. However, some of these principles reflect the qualities that Musashi urges the warrior to have elsewhere in the text: a total commitment to learning, iron discipline in training, the development of both _perception_ and _sight_, and paying equal attention to small things as well as large. As with so much of Musashi’s approach in _The Book of Five Rings_, it is up to the warrior (or student) to meditate upon these principles and to learn how best to apply them in his own life.)

> **Saitō Chikamori’s Samurai Principles**
> 
> In 1642, Musashi’s contemporary and fellow Samurai, Saitō Chikamori (1603-1674) wrote [a work called the Kashoki in which he listed a code of ethics for Samurai](https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g00665/bushido-an-ethical-and-spiritual-foundation-in-japan.html) built upon principles that echo but also differ from Musashi’s:
> 
> - **Sincerity:** Never lie, and don’t be insincere or superficial.
>     
> - **Serve with dignity:** Don’t flatter or behave in a sycophantic manner.
>     
> - **Frugality:** Avoid being greedy.
>     
> - **Politeness:** Never slander or be rude to others.
>     
> - **Modesty:** Avoid being boastful or arrogant.
>     
> - **Loyalty:** Be faithful.
>     
> - **Harmony:** Be civil to others.
>     
> - **Tranquility:** Accept what happens with a calm mind.
>     
> - **Compassion:** Be compassionate and dutiful toward others.
>     
> 
> While Chikamori and Musashi agree on the importance of sincerity (Musashi’s “Be honest”) and tranquility in the face of external events (similar to Musashi’s “Learn to tell the difference between true loss and gain”), Chikamori’s principles are more openly concerned with moral virtues than training and knowledge, which are Musashi’s recurring focus.
