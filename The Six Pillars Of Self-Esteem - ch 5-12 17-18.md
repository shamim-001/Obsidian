# The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Part 2 | Chapters 5-12, 17-18: How to Improve Your Self-Esteem

Now you know what self-esteem is—but how do you improve yours? In Part 2, Branden posits that you do so by practicing six pillars, or categories of behavior: Live with Awareness, Accept Yourself, Take Responsibility, Assert Yourself, Live Intentionally, and Act with Integrity.

Branden explains that **by practicing these pillars, you behave in ways that foster and improve your self-esteem.** As we’ve seen, self-esteem consists of confidence that you’re capable and worthy. In other words, it occurs _when_ you’re capable and worthy—so you must act as if you are, which you do by practicing these pillars.

(Shortform note: The premise that self-esteem occurs when you’re capable and worthy assumes that people can _accurately_ assess these traits in themselves, but research suggests that [people tend to overestimate their capability in skills that might reveal their character](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/sunday/overconfidence-men-women.html)—like how good of a friend they are. Healthy self-esteem requires recognizing not only your positive traits but [also your flaws](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/self-esteem/art-20047976).)

Consistency is key, Branden notes: **The more you get used to behaving in ways that support self-esteem, the more likely** **you’ll continue behaving in those ways** because doing the opposite will make you uncomfortable. Imagine a child learning to brush their teeth: At first, it’s hard and uncomfortable, so they don’t want to do it. But eventually, they develop the habit—and grow into adults who can’t fathom not brushing their teeth regularly.

Branden’s pillars focus on your actions—not your beliefs—because beliefs alone don’t affect your self-esteem. Rather, **your beliefs only affect your self-esteem if they drive your behavior**. As with any value, your beliefs are hollow unless they’re expressed through action. For example, you must believe that effort is worthwhile in order to practice a new skill—if you never try something new, your belief in the value of effort has no substance.

But if you’re trying to _build_ a belief that you’re capable and worthy, how do you practice the six pillars, which seem to _require_ self-esteem? For example, how do you accept yourself (Pillar #2) without the self-esteem to feel worthy? Branden explains that you have to start somewhere—and **since** **behaviors both _cause_ and _are effects_ of self-esteem**, **practicing the pillars begins a virtuous cycle:** The more you accept yourself, the more you’ll raise your self-worth—and thus your self-esteem. The higher your self-esteem, the more self-worth you have, and the more you’ll accept yourself.

(Shortform note: Similarly, dissonance theory contends that [if you do something out of line with your beliefs, you’ll change your beliefs to match your behavior](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130312-why-we-act-against-our-beliefs). For example, in one famous study, men who were paid $20 to lie to a woman that a tedious task was interesting later rated the task as boring; men who were paid only $1 rated the task as interesting—presumably to justify their lie to the woman.)

These practices also focus specifically on what _you_ do—not what others do**.** This is because, as Branden contends, **anybody can significantly improve their self-esteem as long as they perform the right behaviors**. External factors like a dysfunctional childhood may hamper your ability to develop healthy self-esteem, but they don’t determine it. We’ll discuss in Parts 3 and 4 how external factors impact self-esteem, but since the essential ingredient in improving your self-esteem is changing _your behavior_, that is Branden’s primary focus.

> **Are Self-Esteem-Supporting Behaviors Identity-Driven Habits?**
> 
> Branden’s description of self-esteem-supporting behaviors closely aligns with James Clear’s description of identity-driven habits in _[Atomic Habits](https://shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits)_. According to Clear, an [identity-driven habit begins with a decision about who you want to be](https://shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits#how-to-change-your-habits-start-with-your-identity). You then determine how this person would behave—and you act accordingly. The more you behave like that person, the more evidence you gather that you _are_ that person. Eventually, you start to _believe_ you are that person. At that point, you’re behaving like that person because it’s _who you are_.
> 
> Similarly, Branden argues that first, you decide that you want to be someone with high self-esteem. You then learn and implement the behaviors that support self-esteem. The more you behave like someone with high self-esteem, the more you start to believe you have self-esteem. Eventually, you do that behavior because you identify as someone with self-esteem.

### Why You Must Love Your Life

You now know that in order to improve your self-esteem, you must behave in accordance with the pillars of self-esteem. But, as Branden notes, you only make the effort to improve your self-esteem if you have the motivation to do so. So where does this motivation come from? Branden contends that it stems from your love of life. **Loving your life is essential because it motivates you to overcome the two major obstacles to improving your self-esteem: laziness, or inertia, and your desire for comfort.**

(Shortform note: Branden calls this love of life the seventh pillar of self-esteem, and he presents it in his conclusion. We’ve included it here because it’s foundational to the six pillars: Unless you love your life, you won’t bother _trying_ to improve your self-esteem through these behaviors in the first place.)

Branden explains that sometimes, we don’t improve our self-esteem due to inertia: We don’t want to do the work required. But unless you do this work, it’s impossible to raise your self-esteem. When you love your life, you see the value in working to improve your experience and well-being, so you’re able to overcome this inertia.

(Shortform note: In _[Tiny Habits](https://shortform.com/app/book/tiny-habits/)_, behavioral expert BJ Fogg warns against relying on motivation —like that which stems from your love of life—for long-term change because [motivation is too fickle](https://shortform.com/app/book/tiny-habits/chapter-1#motivation-is-complicated): It ebbs and flows based on various circumstances. Instead, Fogg contends that you can improve your odds of successfully changing by substituting abstract goals—like “have higher self-esteem”—with more concrete behaviors, like those described in the six pillars.)

Branden adds that **we may not improve our self-esteem because we want to stay comfortable.** As we’ve seen, improving your self-esteem eventually brings several benefits but may be uncomfortable in the short term. For example, to accept yourself, you must face truths you’d rather ignore. If you can’t handle this unpleasantness, Branden argues, you’ll shy away from every obstacle—and thus never do the work necessary to improve your self-esteem. But if you love your life, you’ll willingly withstand this discomfort because you’re pursuing a greater goal: higher self-esteem that will raise your quality of life. Additionally, as you experience the benefits of your growing self-esteem, you’ll grow even more motivated to keep going.

(Shortform note: If you can get more comfortable with being _un_comfortable, you may grow more motivated to improve your self-esteem and find the process less unpleasant. In _[Can’t Hurt Me](https://shortform.com/app/book/cant-hurt-me/)_, military hero David Goggins recommends [building your tolerance for discomfort by doing something you dislike every day](https://shortform.com/app/book/cant-hurt-me/challenge-3#take-action-getting-used-to-discomfort).)
