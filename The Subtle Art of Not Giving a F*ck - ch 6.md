## Chapter 6: Value—Accepting Uncertainty

Manson says that to grow, we need to entertain doubt about our beliefs, feelings, and rightness. **Instead of trying to prove we’re right, we should look for ways that we’re wrong.** Finding our mistakes will allow us to grow.

He also stresses that **learning and changing our beliefs is a lifelong growth process where we continually build on what we’ve learned before**. We’ll never reach perfect knowledge or perfect certainty. That’s because learning doesn’t take us from wrong to right, but rather from wrong to less wrong. Thus, rather than striving to find the one “right” answer, **we should figure out what we’re definitely wrong about, so that we’ll be less wrong tomorrow than we are today**.

(Shortform note: Manson’s ideal of lifelong learning and growth echoes the concept of _kaizen_, a Japanese word that means _constant self-improvement_. While kaizen usually refers to a [business practice](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6161RV20100208), Robin Sharma’s book _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ urges you to [apply the same principle to yourself](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-monk-who-sold-his-ferrari/chapter-9): In short, to improve yourself in some small way every day. To do this, Sharma advises that you make a list of your weaknesses or fears, because these indicate the areas you need to work on the most. Then, he recommends facing each weakness and fear head-on, which will allow you to effectively make progress.)

### The Problem With Certainty

So that you can change your values to better ones, Manson advises you to doubt the rightness of your current values and be open to their flaws. **Your values are works in progress and never complete**.

He warns that, if you believe your values and priorities are perfect, then you risk becoming dogmatic and entitled—therefore, you need to concede your ignorance. If you accept uncertainty, then you’re less prone to judge others or yourself, or to harbor biases. You’re open to learning what you don’t know through experience. **The more you acknowledge not knowing, the more you can learn.**

(Shortform note: An [empty cup](https://wiki.c2.com/?EmptyYourCup) is an old Zen Buddhist metaphor for an open mind. When you think you already know everything, your “cup” is full: There’s no room for anything else to go in. To learn, you must start by emptying that cup; let go of what you _think_ you know, and approach every situation with an open mind.)

Manson points out that when people are _too_ certain, they can actually end up with insecurity, anger, or bitterness when they get information that contradicts their certainty. For example, an athlete might be confident in his own skills going into a game. However, if he ends up losing, his certainty that he should have won will make him feel worse than if he hadn’t been so sure in the first place.

Certainty can also be used for harmful purposes. Researchers used to believe people did wrong things because they felt bad about themselves, but studies in the mid-1990s found the opposite: **People who do bad things may actually feel good about themselves**. Such people are often certain that they’re in the right, which makes them feel justified in harming others.

In other words, evil people don’t think that they’re evil; they believe other people are evil.

> **Influences on Evil**
> 
> Philip Zimbardo, a psychologist and Stanford professor who has extensively studied the nature of “evil” in humans, gave a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_the_psychology_of_evil) (content warning: images of graphic violence) on how good people can be convinced to do terrible things like torture and kill one another.
> 
> According to Zimbardo, three key influences cause average people to turn cruel and violent:
> 
> - **Propaganda.** People repeatedly see or hear that they are good, and another group is evil, and therefore that other group must be destroyed. As Manson says, such propaganda can cause people to do horrific things, all with the certainty that their cause is just and right.
>     
> - **Societal pressure.** People will often [conform to popular opinions and actions](http://web.archive.org/web/20160311035722/http://lucifereffect.com/guide_conform.htm), even if they personally disagree with them. In other words, people try to “fit in” rather than going against the group and risking ostracization.
>     
> - **Authoritative pressure.** Often, people will ignore their own consciences in favor of obedience to authority figures. One example of this is the infamous [Milgram Shock Experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html), where volunteers were ordered to administer increasingly painful—even lethal—shocks to people. Many did so, simply because they were told to. The “victims” were actors, and the shock devices didn’t actually do anything, but the volunteers didn’t know that.
>     
> 
> Zimbardo wrote about his findings in much greater detail in _[The Lucifer Effect](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/195908/)._

#### Pessimism Brings a Kind of Certainty

Manson says that people can also have negative certainties based in fear—in other words, they’re certain that bad things will happen to them. For example, they assume that everyone will laugh at their ideas, or that they’ll be shunned by their peers.

This is another reason why Manson advises you to **embrace _uncertainty_—in other words, accept that maybe good things will happen and maybe bad things will happen; either way, you’ll deal with each situation as it comes.** By doing so, you’ll eliminate your negative certainties and become more comfortable and confident.

For example, you could remind yourself that you don’t know how people will react to your ideas; they might laugh at you, or they might think you’re brilliant. Embrace the uncertainty: You can’t know what will happen until you try.

(Shortform note: The final lesson in Lori Gottlieb’s _[Maybe You Should Talk to Someone](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone/part-4)_—and the final step in Gottlieb’s treatment—is to welcome uncertainty instead of fearing it. Gottlieb suffers from an unknown disease, which she fears might be fatal. Her therapist asks whether she’d prefer to live in fear because she doesn’t know when she’ll die, or to savor each moment of her life because she doesn’t know how many moments she has left. In the same way, Manson advises us to welcome uncertainty by appreciating the possibilities, instead of fearing the worst outcomes.)

### Personal Growth Requires Uncertainty

Manson suggests that you think of personal growth as a trial-and-error process similar to the scientific method:

- Your values are the hypothesis
- Your actions are the experiment
- Your resulting thoughts and feelings are the data you collect from that experiment

Don’t get fixated on being “right”—like a scientist, you must be ready to discard any hypothesis that the data doesn’t support. Our own inability to admit that we might be wrong can get in the way of personal growth and true happiness.

> It may be reassuring to know that scientists—some of the most intelligent and highly educated people in the world—are wrong about things all the time. In fact, those errors are how we learn new things about the world.
> 
> In _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions)_, Thomas Kuhn explains how **major breakthroughs only happen because scientists realize that they’re wrong about something;** for example, when Ptolemaic astronomy repeatedly failed to predict events like equinoxes, astronomers had to discard it in favor of a new model (Copernican astronomy).
> 
> Scientists don’t fear being proven wrong; they welcome it as a chance to get closer to the truth. In the same way, we can embrace our own wrongness as a chance to learn, instead of something to be embarrassed about.

For example, suppose someone wants to get promoted but isn’t willing to examine her current job performance. She believes that she’s doing excellent work, and refuses to consider that it might not be the case. So, **she avoids the short-term discomfort of confronting her shortcomings at work, but she does so at the expense of future happiness.** If she instead faced and reframed her beliefs about herself, she could grow and improve her life.

Manson also emphasizes that this principle doesn’t just apply to our fundamental beliefs or values, but also to our temporary impressions. When we define an experience as positive or negative, we can be wrong. Sometimes a distressing experience ends up changing our lives for the better, or a seemingly positive experience derails us. The only thing we know is how something feels in the moment.

(Shortform note: Reserving judgment on your experiences is what Tara Brach calls _[Radical Acceptance](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/1-page-summary)_: Taking each experience as it comes, rather than judging it as “good” or “bad.” More traditional Buddhist texts may refer to it as _[equanimity](https://www.learnreligions.com/buddhism-and-equanimity-449701)_; in other words, staying calm in the face of upsetting events.)

According to Manson, continuous growth makes us happier than checking off a list of accomplishments, such as graduating from college, getting a promotion, or buying a house. These kinds of short-term achievements only generate a limited amount of satisfaction; once you achieve them, they don’t keep making you happier and happier. However, constructive values—for instance, being honest with others—involve **an ongoing process that’s never completed, and that process continues to provide satisfaction**.

(Shortform note: Tony Robbins (author of _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within)_) says that the key to happiness is a single word: [progress.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/06/tony-robbins-this-is-the-secret-to-happiness-in-one-word.html) Like Manson, Robbins notes that short-term accomplishments only create short-term satisfaction; the secret to lifelong happiness is to keep growing and improving yourself. He also adds that we all have ideas about what it means to have “made it;” but that once we reach that point, we’ll find that there’s something beyond it. In other words, there’s no point we can reach where we’ll be happy with our accomplishments forever.)

### Let Go of Your Identity

Manson says that you can’t change or improve your life until you’re able to change how you think of or view yourself. **However, people typically avoid changes that challenge their identity.** They even fear changes that could improve their lives because change pushes them out of their comfort zone.

He adds that **success and failure both challenge your identity**, which is why people fear them both. We may reject even beneficial opportunities if they require us to change the values by which we define ourselves.

Buddhism teaches that you should give up your idea of who you are, because your image of yourself is an artificial creation. The way you think about yourself constrains you, and you should give up these limits. **Giving up your concept of who you are frees you to try things, fail, and grow**. Conversely, when you choose a narrow, rigid identity, you constantly feel threatened by things that challenge it.

(Shortform note: In a similar vein, Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus explore, in their book _[Minimalism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism)_, how your identity can be an anchor, because it chains you down to who you _think_ you are. For example, if you see yourself as a free-spirited artist, you might pass up an opportunity for a steady office job because that job doesn’t fit with your self-imposed identity. However, that office job might actually lead you to happiness because some part of you also likes to analyze things and work with numbers. If you narrowly define your identity, you might neglect other aspects of your personality.)

We put a lot of effort into “finding” or “knowing” ourselves, but Manson warns that this can be limiting, if the identity you choose is a narrow one. It can restrict your emotional development and opportunities. It’s better to keep learning and discovering than to “find” yourself; you’ll be more open to improvement, and less judgmental about yourself and about the situations you encounter.

(Shortform note: This lesson extends the lesson at the beginning of Chapter 6: Learning and growth are continuous processes, and you’ll never achieve perfection. The same goes for learning about yourself—you’ll never have a perfect understanding of your own identity, and the identity itself isn’t perfect either. In other words, both _who you are as a person_ and _your self-image_ should grow and change over time.)

In sum, to let go of your identity so that you can adopt better values and priorities, Manson advises that you:

- Accept that you’re not unique or special. **Choose a common, non-limiting identity** such as friend, student, partner, or parent, instead of a narrower one like a victim or a rising star.
- **Give up inflated ideas of yourself that give you a short-lived high**, such as that you’re uniquely talented, smart, or attractive (and are therefore entitled). Letting go of these ideas will make you more resistant to failure and allow you to pursue growth, since failure no longer threatens your identity.

> **How to Let Go of Your Identity**
> 
> Again, Manson provides general guidelines for how to live but offers little in the way of concrete steps you can take. Ryan Holiday’s book _Ego Is the Enemy_ suggests [three practices](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-1a) to help break out of your self-imposed identity:
> 
> **1. Stop talking about yourself.** In addition to being a waste of time and energy, talking about yourself (self-promotion, as Holiday calls it) is all about asserting your identity—that is, your chosen identity.
> 
> - We can particularly see this happen on social media, where every post you write or share promotes a particular image of yourself. This is true whether you’re consciously crafting that image or not.
> 
> **2. Stop thinking about yourself.** Here, Holiday is specifically talking about self-aggrandizing, egotistical thoughts. Such thoughts put your focus on yourself instead of on what you should be doing; they may also cause you to hesitate when making decisions, out of fear that you’ll choose something that doesn’t live up to your inflated self-image.
> 
> - For example, suppose that your chosen identity is “genius scientist.” You might hesitate to take a lesser position at a lab (like an assistant), even if it would be a good opportunity to further your career, because it doesn’t match up with the picture in your head of you leading projects that change the world.
> 
> **3. Stop being prideful.** Holiday claims that pride is a kind of fraud—it’s your ego lying to you, telling you that you’re better than you are, or that your situation is better than it is. Pride can also be very dangerous: If you’re too caught up in your egotistical fantasies, you’ll overestimate your abilities and overlook dangers.
> 
> - It’s likely that your chosen identity is a major source of pride for you, especially if it’s an “exceptional” identity (whether exceptionally positive or exceptionally negative). That’s another reason why such identities can be difficult to change; **letting go of your self-image means letting go of your pride in that image.**
>     
> - One example of pride and self-image getting the better of someone is Jocelyn Wildenstein, an NYC socialite who won billions in a divorce settlement. However, less than 20 years later, [she declared bankruptcy](https://money.com/jocelyn-wildenstein-catwoman-bankrupt/). It’s unclear whether Wildenstein’s situation was purely the result of outrageous spending habits, or if she received significantly less money than she was promised. However, in either case, it’s clear that her pride told her that she was living the high life with near-inexhaustible wealth, when in reality that was not the case.
>     

### Three Questions to Cultivate Doubt

Questioning and doubting yourself is a difficult skill to learn, but you can develop a healthy sense of doubt. Manson suggests that you **ask yourself three questions that encourage humility,** as opposed to certainty.

#### Question 1: Could I Be Wrong?

Acknowledging that you’re wrong, or that you _might_ be wrong, allows you to change. Put another way, **you have to make mistakes in order to learn.**

Manson says that unhappiness could be a sign that you’re wrong about something important in your life—for example, maybe you don’t really want to be a professional actor, you just enjoy performing. In that case, trying to make a living with acting is a mistake—getting involved with a local community theater would be a much better choice for you.

Note that _asking_ whether you’re wrong doesn't mean that you necessarily _are_ wrong—it’s just opening yourself to the possibility.

> As with letting go of your chosen identity, pride is the enemy when it comes to admitting that you’re wrong. People tend to shield their self-image by denying that they’ve made mistakes, even when they know that they’re in the wrong.
> 
> Here are five tactics that might help you [overcome your pride:](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/how-get-better-admitting-you-re-wrong-ncna1003356)
> 
> - **Accept that you’re human.** It’s a fact of life that people make mistakes, and that includes you. Your mistakes don’t make you any less competent or worthy of love.
>     
> - **Reflect on yourself.** Ask yourself questions about your character and your actions. For example, “Do I get angry too easily?” “Am I too controlling?” or, “What did I contribute to that drama at work?”
>     
> - Seek feedback: Ask people how you might improve.
>     
> - Accept feedback: Be open-minded when people tell you their thoughts.
>     
> - Find help when you need it: Therapists can help you learn to accept your weaknesses and face your fears.
>     

#### Question 2: If I _Am_ Wrong, What Does That Mean?

Manson warns that this is a more difficult question, because it goes one layer deeper. It requires examining our values and considering potentially contradictory values.

For example, if you’re arguing with your partner, and you realize she’s actually right and you’re wrong, then that could mean “I _do_ get unnecessarily jealous when my partner talks to another man” or “I tend to jump to conclusions way too easily.”

Usually, this thinking leads you to discover a weakness, which can be painful to hear. Overcoming that weakness might require you to adopt better values, such as open-mindedness or tolerance.

(Shortform note: Psychologists argue that it can be hard to admit that you’re wrong because [your identity is tied to your ideas.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-happy-life/202101/why-is-it-so-hard-admit-when-we-are-wrong) In other words, your beliefs are a key part of your self-image. Therefore, your brain responds to an attack on your ideas the same way it would respond to a physical attack; admitting that you’re wrong feels like losing a life-or-death struggle.)

#### Question 3: Would Changing My Position Improve or Worsen This Situation?

Finally, Manson’s third question requires you to **compare alternatives, including the impact those options will have on others.** To continue the previous example: Might taking a stable job, and restricting acting to a hobby, make you better able to support your family? Manson believes that **this third question reveals whether the values underlying your problem are valid or poor ones.**

In this example, if you insist on pursuing acting as a career even though you’re unsuccessful and miserable, it probably means that you’re guided by a negative value. Perhaps your chosen identity is “actor,” or your pride prevents you from admitting that your acting skills aren’t up to snuff. Thus, you should change your values to ones that allow you to better support yourself and your family, and find a career that suits you better.

> Steps 1 and 2 of [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/alcoholics-anonymous-the-big-book/steps-1-5)’s 12-Step Program involve changing your position so that the organization can help you:
> 
> - “We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.”
>     
>     - This Step means changing your position from either “I don’t have a problem” or “I can solve this problem myself” to “I can’t do this on my own.”
> - “We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.”
>     
>     - This Step means changing your position again; this time to “I can find the help I need.” While the Power in this step originally meant the Christian God, nowadays members accept anything greater than yourself, which you can lean on for support and comfort. For example your local community, Alcoholics Anonymous itself, or any deity that you believe in.
> 
> The fact that the program’s very first and second steps center on changing your position shows how crucial this part of the process is—you can’t make any progress toward your goal until you first confront your mistaken positions.

#### Key Point

Manson offers this tip about changing your positions and values: Ask yourself if your opinion differs from everyone else’s.

He says that when you feel like _everyone else_ is wrong, and you’re the only one who’s right, then you’re probably the one who’s actually wrong. When you feel like you’re battling the world, you’re probably battling yourself—your own mistakes and poor values.

> **Counterpoint:** As Kuhn explains in _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions)_, major advancements and discoveries happen because a person or small group of people go _against_ popular beliefs. In other words, they prove that everyone else is wrong.
> 
> However, overturning a widely accepted idea isn’t easy. It requires time, patience, and irrefutable proof that you’re right—or, at least, that the idea you’re opposing is wrong. Here’s a brief rundown of Kuhn’s model:
> 
> **1. Recognize an anomaly.** An anomaly is something that doesn’t fit with current beliefs.
> 
> - For example, astronomers once believed that the Earth was at the center of the solar system. However, as the field continued advancing, scientists recognized that the geocentric model couldn’t explain the movements of stars and planets that they were observing.
> 
> **2. Explore the anomaly.** If the current system can’t account for the anomaly, then the scientific community enters a period of _crisis._ A crisis is a time when there are two competing models—for example, the Earth-centric and Sun-centric models in astronomy.
> 
> - Oftentimes, things that seem to be anomalies actually do fit into the current system. Perhaps further study reveals a connection that makes the anomaly possible, or scientists find that the anomalous results came from a flawed experiment.
>     
>     - Anomalies are actually very common in science, while true scientific revolutions are quite rare.
> 
> **3. Cause a revolution.** If a new system can explain the anomaly **while still explaining everything the old system did**, it will eventually take over as the accepted model. This is why we now accept that the Sun is the center of the solar system, rather than the Earth.
> 
> Therefore, it’s certainly possible that the popular opinion about something is wrong, and you’re right. However, if you plan to stick to your position, Kuhn’s example shows that you should have ironclad evidence that the popular opinion is wrong; and even then, understand that others won’t change their positions easily.
