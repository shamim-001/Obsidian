# Find Your Why

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Chapter 6: After You’ve Found Your Why

In the previous chapter, we walked through the process of finding your Why, or purpose, and putting it in writing. In this chapter, we’ll discuss what to do next. Sinek notes that **the purpose discussion is only the beginning—now, you’ll move on to _living_ your purpose.**

Sinek identifies two key actions to take after you discover your Why. First, identify your How: the practices and methods that characterize you and help you live your purpose. Then, _share_ your purpose statement.

This chapter will discuss determining your How, or methods, and suggest ways to share these insights with others. The steps for individuals and teams are mostly similar, so we'll discuss the core steps and then highlight the differences.

### 1. Determine Your How

The first step to begin living your Why or purpose is to identify your How, or what practices will help you accomplish your purpose. Sinek says **your How comes from the list of themes you set aside** when you drafted your purpose statement. (Themes are the ideas and actions that came up repeatedly in the stories.)

#### The Importance of Determining Your How

**Your How is the way you operate when you’re at your best.** While your Why guides you to opportunities that will bring you fulfillment, your How helps you distinguish between them to identify those that will allow you to use your best qualities and those that won’t. Although many opportunities, like potential jobs or invitations to social events, may be related to your purpose, they won’t all be right for you.

For example, your Why might be, _“To help women unleash their inner power to create a life where they feel fulfilled, inspired, and empowered.”_ As we discussed earlier, that purpose can direct you to a wide range of fulfilling opportunities, from being a life coach for women, to working at a venture capital firm that funds women-led ventures. That’s where identifying your How, or practices, becomes crucial. If your practices are to “forge deep connections with individuals,” “help people find their own answers to their questions,” and “maintain a positive outlook even in challenging times,” those methods are nudging you in the direction of a life coach rather than venture capitalist.

You can also use your How to analyze your current situation. **If you’re feeling discouraged by your circumstances, your How can help you identify where the discomfort is coming from.** For instance, if you’re working at a company whose purpose aligns with your own but you still feel unfulfilled, it might be because the specific role you play doesn’t let you use your strengths. Perhaps one of your practices is to forge meaningful connections with people, but your job requires you to work on your own most of the time. In that case, your job is not allowing you to do your best work, even if, at the purpose level, you’re aligned.

(Shortform note: While determining your How can help you understand why some situations help you thrive while others work against you, the authors of _[Designing Your Life](https://shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life/1-page-summary)_ offer a way to pinpoint exactly which situations have either a positive or negative effect on you: a wayfinding journal. The journal works like a mood tracker where you list all your activities in a given period, and rate how involved, energized, and joyful you felt while doing each of them. You can then [analyze the tracker to find where your involvement, energy, and joy lag or rise](https://shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life/chapter-3#wayfinding-your-life)—and use your How to understand why.)

#### The Process of Determining Your How

The process of identifying your How, or methods, is the same for individuals and teams:

**First, group similar themes until you have no more than five.** (Remember not to use the themes you already wrote into your purpose declaration) These themes are your How, or methods. Sinek recommends stating your How in actionable language that will be easy to understand. Make the statements active, declarative, and inspiring. For example, “make room for people’s feelings” instead of “be empathetic.”

**Then, elaborate on each How to make it more concrete.** For instance, if a How states “we build safe communities,” you could add the following clarifying statements:

- “We look out for our community members.”
- “We create safe spaces where everyone belongs.”
- “We seek opportunities for connection.”

> **Distinguish Your True Strengths From Personality Myths**
> 
> Besides helping you understand which situations bring out the best in you, writing down your How, or methods, is an opportunity to identify myths you might be holding about yourself. Among the themes you identified, you might have included myths about your personality—[traits you believe you have and that even shape the way you tell stories about yourself](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/202104/what-are-the-myths-you-hold-about-your-personality), but that are inaccurate.
> 
> For example, if you consider yourself organized, you might tell stories in a way that highlights that trait without considering how factually based it is. Thinking through your identified strengths and elaborating on them to make them more specific (for example, asking yourself, “How exactly am I organized?”) is an opportunity to shine a light on these myths and root them out.

### 2. Share Your Purpose

The final stage of Sinek’s purpose process of finding your purpose is to share it. Sharing your purpose helps validate your ideas with the insights of people who know you or your organization well. It also gives you the opportunity to practice using your Why to make more persuasive appeals.

The sharing process is different for individuals versus teams. For individuals, it consists of refining and validating your purpose statement, then sharing it with others. For teams, it consists of holding a group discussion in which you share the purpose statement and practices with additional team members to validate them and encourage wider ownership of the purpose.

#### Individuals: Share Your Insights With Others

Sinek suggests **talking with friends to check whether your purpose statement is an honest expression of your best self**. Ask them what they specifically value in you as a friend. Their answer should reflect the effect you have on their life and echo your purpose statement. If it doesn’t, go back to your discussion partner, and discuss whether your friends have raised any themes worth exploring.

(Shortform note: The authors suggest a collaborative approach to validating your purpose, but this can apply to your life beyond sharing your purpose. In _[Designing Your Life](https://shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life)_, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans argue that since you live in collaboration with others, you should also design your life collaboratively. One way to do that is to [create a team of close allies](https://shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life#step-7-create-a-team-for-ideas-and-support) and influential people in your life who you share your life project design with and who give you feedback and support.)

Additionally, **talk to the people you interact with often**—both at work and in the other spheres of your life—**about your Why and How**. This will help them understand your motivation and strengths which, in turn, will help you collaborate more effectively with them because they’ll know where you’re coming from (your Why) and what skills you can contribute (your How).

(Shortform note: Sharing your Why, or purpose, and How, or methods, with colleagues can contribute to a culture of _[Radical Candor](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor),_ a management style that focuses on supporting people through personal and professional problems. If you’re a leader, you can encourage your employees to share their Why and How with you. Then you can follow Kim Scott’s advice to support their ambitions and growth by analyzing their performance and growth trajectory and [giving them the kind of feedback and challenges they need](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor/chapter-5).)

Finally, **lead with your purpose** instead of your How or What when you introduce yourself to strangers. For instance, before discovering your Why, you might have introduced yourself this way, “Hi, my name is Jane. I’m a community manager, specializing in building vibrant online communities around social media influencers.”

Now, you can make a powerful pitch: “Hi, my name is Jane. My purpose is to build vibrant online communities around leaders and tastemakers so that people can find their tribes and thrive together.”

(Shortform note: Introducing yourself to strangers can be nerve-wracking, especially if you’re sharing something personal like your purpose. To overcome nerves when talking to strangers, follow the tips Keith Ferrazzi outlines in _[Never Eat Alone](https://shortform.com/app/book/never-eat-alone)_, including emulating [an extroverted role model in social situations, joining clubs where you can meet people who share your interests, and setting small targets for yourself](https://shortform.com/app/book/never-eat-alone/part-1#overcoming-nerves), like introducing yourself to one new person every week.)

#### Teams: Share Your Insights With the Rest of the Team

As with the individual process, the team process of sharing your purpose involves validating your insights. However, this works on a much bigger scale and thus requires more steps.

To begin, the authors advise planning another three- to four-hour group discussion session to carry out the steps detailed in this section.

Next, leaders should invite people who didn’t participate in the team’s purpose discussion. The authors suggest you invite no more than 50 people. Look for participants who will be _enthusiastic_ about joining the discussion, because they’re most likely to share their enthusiasm with others after the meeting.

(Shortform note: In _[The Tipping Point](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-tipping-point),_ Malcolm Gladwell explains that enthusiasm is one of the characteristics that make [some people more persuasive than others](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-tipping-point#salesmen-persuaders). Their enthusiasm, which they communicate through their words and body language, makes other people _want_ to listen to their ideas.)

##### Step 1: Introduce Your Purpose

First, show the new participants Sinek’s [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4), and make sure they understand the basic concepts of knowing your Why.

Next, explain that the purpose statement came from the stories team members shared during the previous discussion. Recount some of the stories.

Then, **share the purpose statement**, reminding them that the phrasing might not be perfect, but **the meaning behind it and the action it invites them to take should resonate**.

Be alert to _disagreement_—if most participants feel unsure, you might need to repeat the purpose discussion. Some people might feel unsure if they aren’t aligned with it themselves, if they think others will disagree with it, or if they worry that it goes against part of the team’s strategy or history.

> **Ownership of the Purpose Starts With the Leader**
> 
> At this stage, you’re encouraging ownership of the purpose from people who didn’t participate in discovering it and might therefore be hesitant to adopt it. To help them get there, you can practice _[Extreme Ownership](https://shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership)_—taking full responsibility for your team’s performance. Modeling extreme ownership helps you develop ownership in team members, because if you as the leader have doubts, your team will pick up on that and generate their own doubts. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin recommend two practices to ensure you model the kind of ownership you expect from your team:
> 
> 1. [Make sure the Why or purpose statement resonates with you](https://shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/chapter-3) and that you believe that it makes sense given the team’s strategy and history.
>     
> 2. Don’t be overconfident. [Keep an open mind regarding the disagreements people might have](https://shortform.com/app/book/extreme-ownership/chapter-4) with the purpose, and listen to any concerns.
>     

##### Step 2: Connect With the Purpose and Look Ahead

At this stage, the authors suggest splitting participants into groups. Ask them to share stories of when they felt proud to be a part of the team and how those moments reflected the organization’s purpose. Participants can also identify team members who personify the purpose.

(Shortform note: Speaking about moments of pride and their alignment with your purpose not only helps you reflect on it—it also inspires others to act in alignment with the purpose, or Why. In _[The Power of Moments](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments)_, the authors argue that when you take a courageous action, like living true to your organization’s purpose even when it’s hard, that becomes a defining moment of pride. For people who witness your courage, [it becomes a defining moment of inspiration](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-7-9#practicing-courage-brings-out-the-best-in-others).)

Next, ask participants to **brainstorm ways to use the purpose to propel the team forward**. They should consider _internal management_ and the _products or services_ it offers. For example, they might pitch a new policy or product that reflects the purpose. (Shortform note: Beyond this session, you can encourage team members to pitch creative ideas by applying the tools Ed Catmull shares in _[Creativity, Inc.](https://shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc),_ including [promoting candor](https://shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-3#chapter-6-promoting-candor), [embracing failure](https://shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-3#chapter-7-embracing-failure), and [being protective of new ideas](https://shortform.com/app/book/creativity-inc/part-3#chapter-8-protecting-new-ideas).)

To close, Sinek advises asking for volunteers to share the purpose with peers, be living examples of it, and bring one of the brainstorming ideas to life. (Shortform note: In _[The Tipping Point](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-tipping-point)_, Malcolm Gladwell offers guidelines on how to choose the right messengers. When people volunteer, keep an eye out for [connectors](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-tipping-point/chapter-2#connectors-people-with-strong-social-networks) (people with strong social networks), [mavens](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-tipping-point/chapter-2#mavens-people-who-are-always-in-the-know) (people who are adept at gathering and retaining information), and [persuaders](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-tipping-point/chapter-2#salesmen-the-great-persuaders) (people who are great at getting other people on board), and encourage them to take on some of the volunteer roles.)

### Conclusion: Use Your Why and How to Move Forward

You’ve reached the end of this process, but Sinek emphasizes that **the real work of bringing your purpose to life starts now**. This final section will discuss the authors’ advice for embarking on the journey of living your purpose. (Shortform note: You might find the idea of living your purpose daunting since it’s a lifelong project with no finish line. To keep yourself energized and remind yourself of why you’ve embarked on this journey, follow the authors’ suggestion in _[The Practice of Adaptive Leadership](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-practice-of-adaptive-leadership/1-page-summary)_ to incorporate self-care practices, including [recruiting confidants](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-practice-of-adaptive-leadership/chapter-11#technique-1-recruit-confidants) and [creating safe spaces for yourself](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-practice-of-adaptive-leadership/chapter-11#technique-5-create-safe-spaces-physical-or-mental).)

#### Individuals: Take Your Next Steps

**Sinek argues that identifying your Why (purpose) and How (methods) helps you find fulfillment in several ways:**

Looking back, you can notice patterns in the types of outcomes (What) that gave you the most satisfaction—they were the ones that aligned with your Why and allowed you to apply your How.

Looking at the present, you can decide whether your current situation is the right fit for you. In some cases, having your purpose and methods put into words will reveal that the work you’re doing doesn’t align with your purpose or strengths. If you can’t amend this by finding another job, Sinek advises that you **live your purpose where you are today**, even if the context you’re in isn’t ideal.

For example, let’s say Jane is working at her current job only because she needs the money. Her purpose is “to build vibrant online communities around leaders and tastemakers so that people can find their tribes and thrive together.” Ideally, she’d be a community manager for a lifestyle brand or an influencer, but right now, she’s working as an assistant to a small business owner. Despite this limitation, she can still decide how to show up every day and affect the people she works with, and live true to her purpose. For instance, she might start an online group with coworkers around a common interest or pitch ideas to her boss on how to energize their online following.

Looking forward, you can intentionally seek out and nurture the work that’s most fulfilling for you, using your Why and How as filters to help you capture the right opportunities.

(Shortform note: Your work might not be the area of your life in which you personally need to find fulfillment. According to research, [people see their work either as a job (something they do for money and aren’t attached to), a career (something they do to get ahead in life), or a calling (something that’s inherently fulfilling)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656697921620?via%3Dihub). If work for you is a job or a career, not a part of life where you seek fulfillment, consider whether you can apply your Why to other spheres of your life, like passion projects or your family.)

#### Teams: Assess, Adjust, and Keep Moving Forward

**Now that the team has identified and shared its Why and How, it should assess whether its products, services, policies, and strategies align with them.** If you need to make some changes, the authors suggest starting with small tweaks before moving on to larger issues.

According to the authors, it’s unusual that a team’s core products and services don’t align with its purpose. More often, it’s those projects that never seemed to quite get off the ground that aren’t aligned. Knowing the team’s purpose allows you to be more conscientious about where to spend the team’s resources.

Sinek warns that, as the team grows, people can lose sight of its Why. Teams can avoid this by **keeping the purpose alive through stories** from the discovery process as well as new ones that support the purpose.

> **Suggestions for Enacting Change**
> 
> Other leadership and organizational culture experts suggest strategies to enact positive change in an organization. Once you clarified your Why (purpose) and How (methods), follow these recommendations to put them into practice:
> 
> If you need to make changes to better align with the organization’s purpose, you can follow the guidelines to spearhead positive change that James Kouzes and Barry Posner suggest in _[The Leadership Challenge](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge)_. The first is to search for opportunities by [taking and encouraging initiative and expanding your sources of inspiration](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/principle-3#guideline-5-search-for-opportunities). The second is to take risks, achieve small wins, and [continuously learn from experience](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/principle-3#guideline-6-experiment-and-learn).
> 
> To help the team decide where to allocate its resources, you can make “stop doing” lists, which Jim Collins suggests in _[Good to Great](https://shortform.com/app/book/good-to-great)_. Collins argues that listing the things your organization will no longer do [allows you to distribute resources more effectively](https://shortform.com/app/book/good-to-great/chapter-6).
> 
> Finally, although the authors argue that the team’s purpose should be kept alive, keep in mind Seth Godin’s advice in _[Tribes](https://shortform.com/app/book/tribes/1-page-summary)_: [Don’t let beliefs turn dogmatic](https://shortform.com/app/book/tribes/1-page-summary#tribes-have-partisan-motivation). To maintain balance, consider choosing [which practices to hold on to](https://shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last/chapter-4) and which to be more flexible with, as Collins and Jerry Porras suggest in _[Built to Last](https://shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last)_.
