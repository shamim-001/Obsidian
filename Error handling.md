```js
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
  let result = divide(10, 0);
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
  console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
}

function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Division by zero");
  }
  return a / b;

1. **Network Requests**: When making API calls or performing network operations, errors can occur due to connectivity issues, server problems, or invalid responses. Error handling allows you to handle such errors gracefully, display appropriate messages to the user, and take alternative actions if needed.
    
2. **User Input Validation**: When dealing with user input, errors can occur if the data entered is invalid or doesn't meet certain criteria. Error handling helps you validate and sanitize user input, ensuring it meets the required format or constraints. You can provide feedback to the user about the specific input error and prevent further processing until valid input is provided.
    
3. **File Operations**: When working with file operations, such as reading or writing files, errors can occur due to file not found, insufficient permissions, or incorrect file formats. Error handling allows you to handle these scenarios, provide feedback to the user, and handle fallback actions if necessary.
    
4. **Database Interactions**: When interacting with databases, errors can occur due to connection failures, query errors, or data integrity issues. Error handling enables you to catch and handle these errors, ensuring proper recovery and preventing the entire application from crashing.
    
5. **Third-Party Integrations**: When integrating with external services or libraries, errors can occur due to API limitations, invalid responses, or compatibility issues. Error handling helps you handle these errors, retry requests, or provide alternative functionality if necessary.
    
6. **Asynchronous Operations**: When dealing with asynchronous operations, such as promises or callbacks, errors can occur during the execution or handling of these operations. Error handling allows you to catch and handle these errors, ensuring proper control flow and avoiding unhandled promise rejections or callback errors.
    
7. **Security and Authentication**: When implementing security measures or authentication mechanisms, errors can occur due to invalid credentials, unauthorized access, or token expiration. Error handling helps you handle these scenarios, redirect users to appropriate authentication pages, or handle access denial gracefully.
