## Chapter 3: The Power of Pausing

The previous chapters introduced Radical Acceptance and explained why we all need it. In chapters 3-5 we’ll begin exploring techniques to bring Radical Acceptance into our lives.

Radical Acceptance requires that we be fully present, aware of what’s happening to us and within us. **In order to do that we have to pause—momentarily stop our efforts to control the world and ourselves.** In this chapter we discuss the importance of taking a moment to observe your experiences before responding to them.

Oftentimes, we simply react to problems as they arise. However, when we just react, we’re often responding from a place of negative emotion such as fear, anger, or frustration. Stopping for just a few seconds to observe and identify your current experience can help you respond to it with wisdom and clarity.

### The Essential Pause

For example, if we’re about to eat a piece of chocolate, we should first take a moment to recognize the anticipation we feel, and perhaps the underlying guilt or judgment. We might then decide to eat it anyway—fully present and able to enjoy the experience—or we might put it back and go for a jog instead. **The point of a pause is that we don’t know what will happen next; it leaves us open to the entire world of possibility.**

Tom Wolfe, in his book _The Right Stuff_, describes an experiment the U.S. Air Force ran in the 1950s, sending pilots to fly higher than any pilot ever had before. They found that, once they broke free of the denser part of the atmosphere, they totally lost control of their planes. The harder they tried to correct their path, the more wildly they spun out of control. Several pilots tragically died.

They only found the solution by accident, when a pilot named Chuck Yeager was knocked out by the violent spinning. He came to after his plane had reentered the denser air, where normal flying techniques would work correctly. As it turned out, the only way out of that desperate situation was _doing nothing_. In other words, pausing—letting events play out until he could take control again.

Probably—hopefully—very few of us will ever find ourselves in an out-of-control fighter jet. However, many of us will find ourselves in situations where we feel similarly helpless, and yet desperate to regain control. Perhaps we’ve made a mistake at work, and are scrambling to hide it or make up for it. Maybe we’re angry because someone hurt us, or someone we care about. **These are the times when taking the pause is both hardest and most necessary.**

### Don’t Run Away

There’s an old folk story about a man who was so afraid of his own shadow that he tried to run away from it. However, no matter how far or how fast he ran, he could never put even the smallest distance between himself and his shadow. Eventually the man ran himself to death—but if he’d just taken a moment to sit in the shade and rest, his shadow would have disappeared.

**Each of us has our own shadow.** It’s those parts of us that we don’t accept, and that we try to hide from others. It’s born from the conflict between who we are inside and who our society and culture tells us we’re supposed to be.

Your shadow is created from the thoughts and feelings that you repress in order to avoid rejection from others (or yourself), and rooted in the underlying feeling that you’re somehow defective. For example, if you tell yourself that you shouldn’t be angry about something, you’re not just telling yourself that it’s wrong to be angry—you’re telling yourself that _there’s something wrong with you_ because you’re angry.

Like the man trying to run from his physical shadow, many of us spend our lives running from our emotional shadows. We protect our vulnerabilities by falling into old defensive patterns—lashing out, running away, or hiding from the pain. **Every time we react instinctively, instead of pausing and then facing our shadows with Radical Acceptance, we only make the shadow stronger.**

As the famous psychiatrist Carl Jung once said, the parts of our psyche that we don’t face are the ultimate source of neurosis and suffering. In order to escape the shadow, we have to face it. We must accept that what we’re hiding from may be painful or frightening, but that it’ll never fix itself until we stop running.

#### How the Buddha Found the Pause

**The traditional story of the Buddha’s enlightenment involves both the sacred pause and the shadow.**

Siddhartha Gautama was the son of a king. The king’s advisors said that he would either become a holy man or a great king in his own right. Siddhartha’s father was determined that his son should be a king like he was, so he hid all the pain and suffering of the world from Siddhartha. However, when he was nearly 30, Siddhartha saw signs of age, disease, and death. He wondered how people could find happiness in such a harsh world, and set out to find the answer.

At first he looked for wisdom among the ascetics, people who starve and torture their bodies in the attempt to move beyond physical needs. After several years with them Siddhartha was gaunt and sick, but no closer to enlightenment. He left the ascetics to seek another way.

As he lay beside a river, sick and delirious, he remembered a very old memory. **He’d been a child watching farmers at work, and he suddenly became aware of both the suffering and the beauty in the world.**

The farmers sweated and groaned, the oxen strained to pull their plows, and countless insects were crushed and killed by the tilling. However, at the same time, the sky was beautifully blue, and filled with birds who flew through it effortlessly, joyfully. The air was rich and full of the scent of apple blossoms. Recognizing that there was room in the world for both suffering and joy, Siddhartha felt at peace.

As he came back to himself by the river, Siddhartha realized that he’d experienced that moment when he’d taken a moment to simply sit and watch, rather than chasing after pleasure or pushing away pain. He thought, then, that such a state of awareness and peace must be possible through calm contemplation.

After bathing, eating, and resting, Siddhartha found solitude under a pipal tree—now called the bodhi tree—and began to meditate. In his meditations, he confronted the embodiment of the human shadow, in the form of the god Mara (the Sanskrit word for _delusion_).

Mara tried to sway him with seduction, threats, and promises. However, Siddhartha met each challenge with Radical Acceptance; he neither pursued nor pushed away what Mara offered. Because Siddhartha refused to be ruled by the delusions, they had no power to harm him. Finally, the earth itself bore witness to Siddhartha’s right to be the Buddha, and Mara fled.

**Siddhartha Gautama was a man who took the time to pause and confront his shadow.** In doing so, he reached enlightenment and became the Buddha.

### Practice Pausing

**Learning Radical Acceptance means pausing over and over again.** It means holding our tongue instead of lashing out in anger, or sitting with our anxiety instead of racing to find a distraction. Rather than trying to _think_ or _do_, we simply _experience_ what’s happening to us physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Pausing might seem awkward or unfamiliar, but there are already many moments where we take the time to do so. In the shower, perhaps, or while driving to work, we often find that we’re not worried about anything in particular—our minds are free to wander. A pause might be the sigh of relief when you figure out a difficult problem, or the moment when you lie down in bed and let go of the day’s stress.

The philosopher Ajahn Buddhadasa calls these short pauses “temporary nirvana.” We briefly experience true peace and freedom when we stop chasing or resisting experiences. He writes that those pauses are necessary; without them we’d either die or go mad.

The famous pianist Arthur Rubenstein was quoted as saying that he didn’t handle the notes better than anyone else—his art lived in the pauses. Like in music, the silence of a pause creates a background that brings the foreground into sharp relief. It makes what comes after it more deliberate and more meaningful.

In short, the pause is the moment when we can see all of the branching paths forward. For example, if someone has insulted us, in that pause we can see the various ways we could respond. What would the result be if we fought back; would the person back down, or would it simply escalate? What if we simply let it go; would things go back to normal, or would the person take it as permission to continue? **There may not be a single correct answer, but in the pause we can see our options and try to choose wisely.**
