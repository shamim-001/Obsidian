## Chapter 2: Two Different Worlds

The two mindsets are different worlds where the same things have different meanings for the inhabitants of each world. Most important is how people with each mindset — fixed or growth — define and interpret success and failure.

In general, **in the fixed mindset world, success is about proving to yourself and others that you’re smart and talented**. It’s about validation. If you fail, it means you’re not smart or talented, therefore failure is intolerable. Failure is any type of setback: a bad grade, losing a competition, not getting the job or promotion you want, being rejected. **Effort is a negative — if you need it, that means you’re not smart.**

**In the growth mindset world where you can change, success is about stretching yourself,** learning, and improving. Failure is not seizing an opportunity to learn, not striving for what’s important to you, not reaching for your potential. **Effort is a positive — it helps you get smarter** and increase your abilities.

Remember, mindsets are beliefs — although they’re powerful, you can change them.

### Defining Success

When you start out in life, success is about learning. **You’re born with a drive to learn**. Babies learn and stretch themselves every day. They don’t worry about failing or quit. For instance, they don’t decide walking is too hard and give up or fear falling. They just keep trying.

**As early as preschool age, however, children develop mindsets or beliefs about their ability**. Fixed mindsets slow or shut down the intense drive to learn. Some children become fearful of not being seen as smart; they begin rejecting challenges. Others, with a growth mindset, embrace challenges and relish becoming smarter. **Fixed mindset children become non-learners**.

For instance, the author and her research team offered four-year-olds a choice of redoing an easy puzzle or trying a new, harder one. Children who believed in fixed traits wanted to redo the easy puzzle (the safe choice), while children with growth mindsets wondered why anyone would want to keep redoing the same thing when they could try something else. In other words, children with a fixed mindset wanted to make sure they succeeded, as they believed smart people always do, while those with a growth mindset wanted to get smarter.

Over time, **people with fixed mindsets and growth mindsets come to view the nature of success differently**.

- Fixed-minded people avoid challenges because they want to feel smart and in control. In contrast, growth-minded people thrive on challenge and stretch themselves past their comfort zone.
- Fixed-minded people care about perfection. To feel smart, they not only have to “get it” right away, they have to be perfect at it. In contrast, growth-minded people said they felt smart when they tried hard and made progress or were able to do something they couldn’t do before. Feeling smart was about learning.
- Fixed-minded people expect to immediately perform at high levels, without the need to learn. They don’t allow themselves time to develop or become. As a result, they get frustrated by failure and give up early. In contrast, growth-minded people expect to need to put in lots of time and effort to get better at things, and are thus more resistant to failure.
- Fixed-minded people prefer to be validated by others as capable, to be seen as geniuses. In contrast, growth-minded people aren’t afraid to acknowledge a need to learn through questioning and receiving critical feedback.

Here’s a range of examples about how fixed- and growth-minded people behave differently.

> **College Classes**
> 
> At the University of Hong Kong, everything is taught and learned in English, which means strong English skills are essential to a student’s academic success. Students have varying English skills when they arrive. Researchers measured incoming students’ mindsets, then asked those with poor English skills whether they would take a course to improve their English if it were offered. Fixed-mindset students weren’t interested, while growth-mindset students said “yes” enthusiastically. The fixed-mindset students were willing to risk their academic careers for the short-term value of seeming smart.
> 
> Another study measured the brainwaves of students of each mindset as they answered hard questions and got feedback. Their brainwaves showed their level of attention to and interest in the feedback. Fixed-mindset people paid attention to feedback on whether their answers were right or wrong (reflecting their ability), but weren’t interested in information that could help them learn — they weren’t even interested in learning the right answer when they got something wrong. In contrast, growth-minded people wanted to learn and paid attention to information that would help.
> 
> A last study observed pre-med students facing a difficult chemistry course. Researchers found that fixed-mindset students only stayed interested in the course if they did well immediately. Those who struggled with it at the outset lost interest — it didn’t validate their intelligence. In contrast, for growth-minded students, the challenging nature of the course drove their interest and motivated them.

> **Fixed-Minded vs. Growth-Minded CEOs**
> 
> Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca was successful at first in introducing new initiatives in the struggling company. But after his initial success, he lapsed into a fixed mindset of seeking validation rather than improvement. He kept bringing back the same models of cars each year, although consumers were rejecting them for more innovative Japanese models. He got rid of his critics and elevated people who fed his ego, which was a road to failure (more on his experience follows in Chapter 5).
> 
> Growth-minded CEOs aren’t afraid to acknowledge a need to learn through questioning and receiving critical feedback — as a result, they grow and their companies do too. For example, when Lou Gerstner was hired to turn IBM around, he ignored Wall Street and focused on the long term, although he was criticized for not immediately boosting stock prices.

> **Sports**
> 
> Sports offers numerous examples of growth-minded athletes who constantly stretched themselves. In fact, **stretching, rather than winning, is what motivated them**.
> 
> For example, as a child, soccer player Mia Hamm pitted herself against older, more experienced players to improve her skills. At age ten, she joined the eleven-year-old boys’ team. She continued this approach in her college career, joining the top college team in the U.S. She tried to “play up” to the level of better players and as a result, she improved faster than she had thought possible.

> **Relationships**
> 
> Whether you choose validation or improvement can shape your relationships as well as your performance at work.
> 
> For instance, when asked to describe their ideal mate, fixed-mindset people wanted someone who would validate them — put them on a pedestal and make them feel perfect. Growth-minded people wanted a mate who could see their flaws and help them improve, and encourage them to try new things.

### The Potential to Grow

One reason people with a fixed mindset feel they have to be perfect is that **they see every test or evaluation as a _permanent_ measure of their ability**.

For example, in a study of fifth graders, researchers told them that a certain test could measure their ability. Although the researchers provided no other information about the test, the fixed-mindset students concluded that it could not only measure how smart they were, but it could also measure how smart they’d be as adults, essentially defining them forever. Growth-minded students didn’t believe a test could measure how smart they were, nor did they believe it could predict how smart they’d be in the future because their intelligence was always growing.

Fixed-mindset educators do in fact believe you can measure someone’s ability and determine their potential. But those who’ve tried to do that have been wrong repeatedly. Examples of people who were told they lacked potential include Charles Darwin, Marcel Proust, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Lucille Ball, and Jackson Pollock.

By definition, you can’t predict potential, if it’s understood as the capacity to develop over time with effort and training. **It’s impossible to be certain of how far anyone can go with effort and training.** For example, many of artist Paul Cezanne’s early paintings were terrible. He needed time and effort to develop.

Ability to grow may be a more important indicator for future achievement than current success:

- When NASA solicited applications for astronauts, it looked for people who came back and learned from failures, rather than those with a string of successes.
- As CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch chose executives based on their capacity to develop.
- Famed ballet teacher Marina Semyonova chose to work with students who took criticism as motivation to improve.

### Fixed Mindsets and Entitlement

**A fixed-mindset person’s need to believe they’re smart can evolve into a sense of entitlement** or specialness. Not only are they smart, they’re smarter or more talented than anyone else. Their need for validation is constant. The self-esteem movement bolsters this belief, for instance by encouraging you to remember your specialness with daily affirmations.

Tennis player John McEnroe is an example of both an entitled attitude and the pitfalls of a fixed mindset. He believed only in talent. Because he didn’t learn, he didn’t improve or grow as a player.

In terms of feeling entitled, McEnroe acknowledged that he needed to be the center of attention. He expected people to cater to him. Further, he believed that because he was better than others, he had a right to abuse them. He often blew up at people over small things, like the coarseness of the sawdust provided to him at courtside for drying his hands.

In contrast, basketball player Michael Jordan was growth-minded. He found public admiration embarrassing because he didn’t consider himself to be better than others — he’d developed his skills by working at them and always had room to improve.

### Confronting Failure

Mindset drives how people define and cope with failure. **For people with a fixed mindset, failure is an identity** that they fear and try to avoid, rather than something that happens.

For example, as a child, the author refused to participate in spelling and French competitions, although she excelled at those subjects, because she was afraid of losing and being defined as a failure. Golfer Ernie Els felt the same way. When he won a tournament for the first time in five years, he explained what had been at stake: he said that if he had lost again, he’d have become a different person in his mind — a permanent loser. Similarly, every spring, thousands of young people feel they’re failures when they get rejection letters from their top choices for college.

**Failure is hard for growth-minded people too, but they don’t let it define them**. They see it as something to confront and learn from. For example, Minnesota Viking Jim Marshall didn’t let a spectacular failure define him. He grabbed a loose ball and ran into the wrong end zone, scoring for the opposing team, the 49ers, on national television. Rather than sitting out the rest of the game and feeling ashamed, he went back in and played well during the second half, contributing to a win for his team. After the game, he continued to use the experience in a positive way, answering letters and speaking to groups about coping with failure, while he also worked to improve as a player.

In contrast, confronting failure with a fixed mindset doesn’t give you any constructive way to overcome it. When you’re a failure, then what? **Some of the negative ways people with a fixed mindset try to shore up their self-esteem include giving up, cheating, and blaming**.

Researchers asked seventh graders how they’d respond to a poor grade on a test in a new course. Predictably, the growth-minded students said they’d study harder for the next one. But the fixed-mindset students said they’d study less — because what’s the point if you lack the ability? Instead, they said they’d consider cheating.

Sometimes, people with fixed mindsets try to make themselves feel better by focusing on others who are worse off. In a college study, researchers allowed students who did poorly on a test to look at others’ tests. Those with a growth mindset looked at the tests of others who’d done better because they were looking for ways to improve. Students with a fixed mindset looked at the tests of those who’d done worse in order to feel better about themselves.

Alternatively, **people with fixed mindsets may blame others or make excuses**. Every time he lost a match, John McEnroe had an excuse — he had a backache, he overtrained, he ate before the match, or he was a victim of unfair expectations. In contrast, when growth-minded CEO of General Electric Jack Welch made poor decisions leading to poor results, he personally phoned top colleagues to deliver the news and take the blame.

As UCLA basketball coach John Wooden noted, you can’t learn from your failures if you deny them by blaming someone else.

#### Mindset and Depression

**Mindset also plays a role in how people handle depression**. In a study of college students, those with a fixed mindset had worse depression than those with a growth mindset. The fixed-mindset students obsessed over problems and failures, which made them feel worthless. The more depressed they felt, the more paralyzed they became — they didn’t do anything to address their problems, such as doing class assignments or studying. In contrast, the more depressed that growth-minded students felt, the more determined they were to take action. They tried harder to keep up with their classwork and obligations.

### The Value of Effort

To instill in children the value of effort, we teach them such stories as “The Tortoise and the Hare” and “The Little Engine That Could.” The lesson is to keep trying and you’ll succeed: Slow and steady wins the race.

But **those with fixed mindsets take away a different lesson: Effort is for those who lack talent.** They’d rather be the faster, more talented hare than the tortoise, who only succeeded because the hare messed up. A smarter hare would beat a no-talent tortoise.

Stories like “The Tortoise and the Hare” suggest an either/or dynamic: you have talent or you put in a lot of effort. Author Malcolm Gladwell has suggested that society values accomplishment that seems effortless over achievement through work and practice. We like superheroes with extraordinary abilities to easily surmount obstacles.

The downside of this belief can be costly. A Duke University study found anxiety and depression among female students who aspired to “effortless perfection” in appearance and in their academics. In contrast, growth-minded people believe that no one is perfect. No matter how talented you are, you have to work and improve to fulfill your potential.

#### Effort is Risky for Fixed-Minded People

**If you believe you’re supremely talented, you have more to lose by trying** than untalented people have. Effort is scary for people with a fixed mindset because:

- Geniuses aren’t supposed to need effort.
- If you apply effort and failure, you don’t have any excuses. But if you didn’t try and failed, you can say, “I could have done (X).”

Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, a talented young violinist who debuted at age ten with the Philadelphia Orchestra, almost derailed her career when she reached Juilliard and refused to expend any effort out of fear of failing. When she arrived there and faced stiff competition, she lost confidence. She had many bad habits, including the way she held her violin, but she wouldn’t change them. She stopped bringing her violin to lessons until the teacher confronted her. Afraid of losing the teacher, she made a turnaround and trained seriously for a competition, which she won, having learned the value of effort.

**Fear of effort can stymie relationships too**. For example, a woman who was accustomed to short-lived relationships with inconsiderate boyfriends was unsettled when she started dating a considerate man. She really liked him but feared putting effort into the relationship because she’d be a failure if it didn’t work out. So she didn’t take the risk and lost out on a potentially rewarding relationship.

In contrast, **for a growth-minded person, failure is not making the effort to pursue something you really want**. Tennis great Billie Jean King said that when you look back on your life, you can say one of only two things: “I gave my all” or “I could have been…” Growth-minded people believe in giving their all.

### Q&A

**Why do fixed-mindset people feel they must prove their superiority repeatedly — isn’t once enough?**

New and bigger challenges are always coming up. Yesterday’s performance may not be good enough today. The baseball you play in the minor leagues isn’t the same level of baseball you need to play in the majors. Even though you’ve proven your ability before, you’ll keep finding yourself in the position of having to do it again. The only way to break the cycle is with a growth mindset that embraces effort and the risk of failure.

**When people fail, is it their fault for not trying hard enough?**

People can fail through no fault of their own — maybe they had fewer advantages, such as resources, a strong support system, or educational opportunities, than the next person. Those with the most resources and the fewest hurdles usually have the greatest chance of succeeding in their efforts. Those facing hurdles such as illness or financial setbacks can be sidetracked more easily. Effort is important, but it isn’t the only thing.

**Workaholics seemingly have a fixed mindset, yet they put in a lot of effort despite the risk of failure. Does that mean they’re not really fixed-minded?**

Generally, people with fixed mindsets prefer to succeed through ability rather than effort. But they may be willing to expend great effort for long-term goals. Also, they may not share every fixed-mindset belief, for instance that smart people don’t need to apply effort. However, they may have other fixed mindset beliefs such as feeling superior and not tolerating criticism.

**If you’re comfortable with a fixed mindset — with your abilities and performance — why should you change?**

No one has to change. But you have the choice of changing your fixed mindset if it’s not serving you well — for instance, if you’re miserable because you feel like a failure. You may also be depriving yourself of opportunities for success in new areas by not trying something new. In the areas where you’re comfortable, you may find that relying on talent without effort has limits — it takes you only so far.

**Do people with fixed mindsets avoid challenge simply because they lack confidence?**

People with fixed mindsets can have as much confidence as growth-minded people have to start out with. But fixed-mindset people can lose confidence when they have setbacks. When that happens, like John McEnroe, they feel the need to protect their confidence and self-image by blaming and making excuses for failures.

**People with growth mindsets don’t really need confidence to try something challenging or new because their goal is learning rather than validation**. Teen golfer Michelle Wie wanted to learn what it was like to play in a tournament against the best players. So she entered a PGA tournament against the best male players. She learned she could play at that level, although she needed to improve.

### Change Your Mindset: Tips

- A fixed mindset can undercut your enjoyment of learning. Did you ever enjoy something for a while and then want to quit when it started to seem more difficult? You were probably in a fixed mindset. Create a growth mindset by imagining your brain growing by forming new connections as you keep learning.
- If a past failure keeps bothering you, try rethinking it from a growth perspective. Think about what you can learn from the situation and how you can grow.
- It feels great to be around people who think we’re perfect, or who don’t question or criticize us. Many of us would rather avoid negative feedback — but give yourself an opportunity to grow by asking someone for constructive criticism.
- Do you give up and withdraw when you feel depressed? Next time, try to put yourself in a growth mindset by doubling down when things are difficult. View effort as an asset.
