## Chapter 10: Building Strong, Efficient Teams

Carefully selecting team members who complement each other doesn’t mean there won’t be any challenges. Everyone has different personalities, perspectives, and styles of working, so it’s only natural to have misunderstandings and disagreements. In this chapter, we condense Dalio’s principles for managing teams so that team members stay aligned (or, as Dalio says, “stay in sync”) and make decisions more efficiently.

> **How to Stay Aligned in a Hybrid Work Environment**
> 
> With the rise of hybrid work setups, it may be more challenging for teams to stay in sync. [Keep the following alignment tips in mind](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2021/05/11/how-to-sync-your-post-pandemic-hybrid-team/?sh=7b1407b33a6a) when some team members work at home and others work at the office:
> 
> - **Check your biases.** You may have unintentional proximity bias, thinking those in the office are more productive than those working from home. Being aware of this tendency can help you safeguard against it.
>     
> - **Keep interactions on even footing.** While the workplace may be hybrid, your meetings shouldn’t be. Have meetings with everyone in one place _or_ with everyone on video call, regardless of location.
>     
> - **Keep everyone in the loop.** Communicate priorities, deliverables, and changes to remote workers in a timely manner.
>     
> - **Stay in touch.** Check in with all team members, keep an eye out for individuals who may feel alienated, and find ways to keep the team connected.

### Dealing With Disagreements

Dalio says that people can disagree on many things, and resolving _every_ disagreement would require a lot of time and effort. To be more efficient, he advises making a list of disagreements, going down the list, and eliminating unimportant disagreements such as complaining from people who are close-minded.

(Shortform note: Dalio doesn’t elaborate on _what_ makes a disagreement “legitimate” or not. As a general rule of thumb, [a disagreement is worth your time and attention](https://medium.com/swlh/5-tips-to-recognise-bad-criticism-2ffc717ad121) if the dissenting opinion is specific, objective (rather than a personal attack), and focused on the future—it’s concerned with outcomes rather than something that happened in the past. Otherwise, it’s likely just an empty complaint.)

Prioritize the most important issues with the most credible parties, then practice both open-mindedness and assertiveness to come to a resolution.

#### Be Open-Minded and Assertive

Dalio says you must see things through the other person’s eyes while communicating clearly how _you_ see things. Most people find it easier to be assertive and share how they see things than to empathize with the other person. If you have overly assertive people on the team, remind them that the real winners are those who can change their minds, since they learn something.

On the other hand, other people are not assertive enough, and they’re too willing to accept others’ conclusions. Remember that hiding viewpoints hampers you from getting the best ideas possible, since not all ideas are laid on the table. Thus, Dalio explains, those in disagreement need to strike the right balance when it comes to assertiveness in order to come to a satisfying resolution.

> **How Women Can Manage the Assertiveness Double-Bind**
> 
> Dalio encourages assertiveness for everyone, but he doesn’t acknowledge that in many workplaces, women who are assertive are still viewed in a negative light. This is because [women are expected to demonstrate gender-normative characteristics](https://cultureplusconsulting.com/2018/03/10/gender-bias-work-assertiveness-double-bind/) like warmth and submissiveness, which run counter to typical “masculine” leadership characteristics like assertiveness and competitiveness.
> 
> While the ideal scenario would be a cultural shift so that women aren’t judged differently for displaying stereotypically masculine behavior, current societal norms mean that women still need to find ways to get around unfair expectations. Here are some [ways women can be more assertive](https://cultureplusconsulting.com/2018/03/10/gender-bias-work-assertiveness-double-bind/) without backlash:
> 
> - **Strike a balance between assertiveness and warmth.** Start and end emails on a friendly note while clearly communicating your message. Avoid using words like “maybe” and “sorry,” which may suggest weakness.
>     
> - **Frame your statements** with a behavior phrase (“I’ll be as direct as possible”), a value phrase (“It’s important for me to be honest about this”), or an inoculation phrase (“I know I may be seen as disagreeable, but I’m going to be very direct”).
>     
> - **Subtly establish dominance.** Certain poses like putting hands on your hips and standing tall, and behaviors like speaking in a loud voice can make you appear dominant without the negative implications of speaking assertively.
>     
> - **Keep it short.** Women who talk lengthily are seen as less competent than their male counterparts.
>     

#### Remember That Suggestions Aren’t Criticisms

When other people are assertive, it may rub you the wrong way. Dalio says that your ego might confuse suggestions and questions with criticisms. He notes that there’s a difference between someone telling you to “keep your eye on the speed limit” and someone saying, “You’re driving recklessly and ignoring the speed limit.”

(Shortform note: [To keep yourself from taking things personally](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-flux/201408/how-stop-taking-things-personally), take some time to understand the other person’s issues—for example, perhaps _they_ believe they’ll only be heard if they speak aggressively.)

#### Communicate Well

Effectively navigate disagreements with the following conversation tips from Dalio:

**Start by assuming _you’re_ not communicating or listening well,** rather than blaming the other party. (Shortform note: You might find that in order to reduce conflict, you have to adjust your communication style to who you’re talking to. In _[The Four Tendencies](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-four-tendencies)_, Gretchen Rubin lists some general rules for [conversing with different personality types](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-four-tendencies/chapter-7): **Upholders** want to know what needs to be done, **questioners** want to know _why_ something needs to be done, **obligers** want to be held accountable for what needs to be done, and **rebels** need to know that they have a choice.)

**Listen properly.** This means repeating what you’re hearing to make sure you understand, whether it’s a question or a statement. If someone keeps getting interrupted, Dalio says you should use the two-minute rule: Give each person two minutes to explain their reasoning completely. If either party is too emotional to be logical, defer the conversation by a few hours or days. (Shortform note: Many people think good listeners don’t interrupt and simply repeat what the other person says, but [research suggests that this isn’t the case](https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do). More than absorbing information, good listeners amplify what the other person says, provide constructive feedback, and energize the conversation.)

**Ground them in facts.** If someone says “I feel like [X] is true,” ask them, “Is it true? How do you know?” (Shortform note: Keep _yourself_ grounded in facts by [managing your emotions](https://hbr.org/2017/12/how-to-control-your-emotions-during-a-difficult-conversation). Take a deep breath, and have a go-to mantra to help you stay calm.)

**End the conversation and move forward.** State the conclusions. If there isn’t an agreement, say so; if there is further action, make a to-do list, and assign people tasks with specific deadlines. Then, share the conclusions via email or recordings. (Shortform note: Author Kim Scott ends conversations at the right time and keeps things moving forward by making sure that [debates and decisions don’t take place in one meeting](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor/chapter-8). In _[Radical Candor](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor)_, she writes that decision-making requires that you first have a debate meeting to give everyone involved a full understanding of the matter. Then, have a separate decision meeting to signal that debating is over and that it’s time to make decisions and delegate tasks.)

### Managing Meetings

Aside from disagreements, meetings can also take up a lot of your team’s time. Dalio shares his tips for making meetings more effective and efficient:

- **Clarify the details.** Make clear who is leading the meeting, what level the meeting is operating on (principle or machine level, case-at-hand level, or specific-fact level), and what the goals are—a meeting aimed to educate is different from a debate.
- **Limit the participation to whom you value most for your objectives.** For debating a topic, three to five smart people may be better than 20, due to the decreasing marginal benefits of new perspectives, and inefficiency in coordinating a larger group. For educating, more people should be involved, since this increases leverage.
- **Avoid topic slip** by tracking the conversation on a whiteboard so everyone can see where it’s going.
- **Have standardized meeting agendas** for regular meetings.

> **Can This Meeting Be an Email?**
> 
> Clarifying the purpose of a meeting, limiting participation, keeping discussions on track, and having a standard agenda as Dalio advises can help streamline meetings. However, some meetings may be unnecessary, no matter how efficient they are. Dalio doesn’t say how you should move forward if people are disagreeing on the necessity of a meeting. To decide if you should call an [in-person meeting or just send an email](https://www.forbes.com/sites/harmoncullinan/2019/05/16/to-meet-or-email-that-is-the-question/?sh=d07decb50dc8), ask the following questions:
> 
> - **Are emotions running high?** With emails, we find it difficult to gauge tone, tend to assume negative intentions, and do a lot of guesswork when it comes to context. Opt for a face-to-face meeting when things are getting heated.
>     
> - **What is the purpose?** Email is for communicating information; meetings are for solving problems.
>     
> - **What can make us feel more connected?** Consider which option would strengthen your relationships with your co-workers. Sometimes a funny note may be enough.
>     
> - **How complex is the topic?** Meetings may be more ideal for topics that have a lot of important details or involve a lot of people.
>     

### Cultivating Meaningful Relationships

Dalio believes that a key component of team-building is to treat people like partners or extended family, because this makes relationships more special than quid pro quo employment agreements. When people have a common mission, they struggle _well_ together, and they help each other evolve. However, Dalio notes that even though Bridgewater is akin to a family business, the “family members” can still be let go if they don’t perform excellently.

(Shortform note: Some experts disagree with Dalio, arguing that [treating employees like family can backfire](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2019/11/05/stop-saying-your-company-is-like-a-family/?sh=651a88a51545). Firing “family” seems hypocritical, and an organization requires good leadership, not parenting. Instead, they say, it might be better to view your organization as a sports team, where there are clear goals, roles, and expectations.)

Dalio gives some tips for cultivating meaningful relationships in the workplace:

**Expect your team to think like owners, and to behave accordingly.** This helps people uphold their responsibilities, such as making sure things are taken care of when they’re on vacation, and spending company money like it’s their own. (Shortform note: In _[Multipliers](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/multipliers)_, authors Liz Wiseman and Greg McKeown say you can [increase employees’ sense of ownership](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/multipliers/chapter-7) by putting them in charge of projects and letting them handle small issues without your help. This makes them responsible for the results of a project and gives them challenges that force them to learn new things.)

**Fund ways for people to build relationships with each other.** Pay for half of the activities people want to do together, and pay for food and drink at hosted dinners. (Shortform note: You can even [help people form connections in a remote working environment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2021/03/30/4-ways-to-build-stronger-workplace-relationships/?sh=7c9496bc5513) by having Zoom rooms or Slack channels where people can have non-work discussions.)

**Accept that some people will not buy into the culture.** Dalio claims that these team members can still contribute a lot and be considerate. (Shortform note: In contrast, some argue that not buying into the culture is a red flag. In _[Radical Candor](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor)_, Kim Scott explains that [those with a poor cultural fit will constantly be at odds with their colleagues](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor/chapter-5), so it’s best if they leave the organization.)

**Treasure honorable people who behave well even when you’re not looking.** Dalio believes that most people will pretend to operate in your best interest while operating in their own, so those with integrity are exceptionally valuable. (Shortform note: While you should treasure good people, it’s also important to set boundaries with them. [If your professional relationship with an employee develops into a friendship](https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-be-friends-with-someone-who-works-for-you?registration=success), remind them that there may be information you can’t share with them, and establish ground rules about conversations outside the workplace.)
