## Feedback 2: Point Out Problems Indirectly

### Principles

- Avoid the direct surgical attack. People typically know what they’ve done wrong, and calling explicit attention to it feels like issuing an order, which invites resistance.
- **With an oblique approach, you allow the person to come to her own conclusion more.** It also allows them to save face, thinking something like, “I had a good reason for the last mistake, but no longer! I am resolved to right the ship.”

### Tactics

- **Follow your sincere praise NOT with “but” but rather with “and.”** Contrast:
    - “You’ve done an excellent job working hard, but you could have prevented these careless mistakes.” vs
    - “You’ve done an excellent job working hard, and if you focus next on building a checklist, you’ll improve your accuracy rate.”
    - This avoids the negative detraction of feeling failure.
- If a task is slipping, do it yourself, then show the work to the person. This sets a proper example of diligence.

### Examples

- McKinley to his speechwriter, when displeased with a speech: “That’s a splendid speech. No one could have prepared a better one. There are many occasions in which this would be precisely the right thing to say. But is it the right one for this occasion?”
- Charles Schwab saw workers in a mill smoking under a “No Smoking” sign. Instead of chastising them, he handed each of them a cigar, asking “I’ll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on the outside.”
- John Wanamaker saw a customer being ignored at the sales counter while the salespeople were chatting in the corner. He serviced the woman himself, then handed the purchase to the salespeople to be wrapped. This pointed out the error clearly but indirectly.
- A eulogy writer passed the sermon by his wife. Finding it dull, she said, “that would make an excellent article for the _North American Review_.”
- A dentist noticed his cleaner wasn’t cleaning a metal cup holder. He wrote a note: “Thank you for your fine job of cleaning. Two hours twice a week is a limited amount of time, even for someone of your abilities. Please work an extra half an hour from time to time if you need to do those ‘once in a while’ tasks, like polishing the cup holders. Of course, I’ll pay you for the time.” He returned to find the office spotless.
