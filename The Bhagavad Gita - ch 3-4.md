## Chapters 3-4: The Importance of Action

In this chapter, Krishna moves away from talk of meditation and prayer and discusses the importance of actions. **The key is to act selflessly—not meaning “charitably” in the usual sense of the word, but literally without thought for yourself, focused only on God.** Acting according to your dharma, and devoting all of your actions to Vishnu, is called _karma yoga,_ or selfless service.

### Selfless Action

Arjuna asks Krishna—in light of what he’s learned about yoga, meditation, and inward thought—why he needs to fight this war. He argues that if wisdom, not action, is the key to living well and breaking the cycle of reincarnation, then Krishna telling him to fight doesn’t seem to make sense, since fighting would be taking action.

Krishna answers that there are two righteous paths through life: _jnana yoga_, the way of meditation and contemplation; and _karma yoga_, the way of selfless action. **Of the two, karma yoga is better and more practical.** Nobody can go through life without taking some actions, and selfish actions cause harm to others and to the world. Therefore, the best way to act is with no sense of self: Do what’s right and devote all your actions to God and the betterment of the world, with no thought of personal rewards.

Krishna goes on to say that the duty of selfless service was created at the same time as humanity, and that the two are intertwined. He promises that people who act selflessly will prosper, and all of their desires will be fulfilled. Selfless service comes from _Brahman_, the ultimate force and truth behind everything that exists, and it pleases the _devas_, minor deities who look after humanity. **To accept the blessings of the devas without offering selfless service in return would make one a thief.**

(Shortform note: Later in the _Gita_, Krishna reveals that Brahman is also his own truest nature. In spite of that, Brahman is usually spoken of like a non-sentient force, rather than a deity, similar to “the Force” in Star Wars.)

Krishna repeats several times that only people who understand the true Self may act selflessly. Remember what he said about wise people in the previous chapter: They recognize that they are in all things and all things are in them. Understanding the true Self means understanding that truth.

**Therefore, the wise are able to act with no thought for themselves, because they understand who and what they are.** They don’t see themselves as the ones performing actions, they’re merely vessels through which the greater powers of the universe are acting.

#### The Three Gunas

The three gunas are some of the hardest things to overcome on one’s quest for selfless action. _Guna_ can be roughly translated as “attribute” or “property.” There are three gunas: _sattva, rajas,_ and _tamas_. Sattva is the guna of goodness and wisdom and the only one of the three that’s desirable. Rajas is the guna of passion and anger; it often drives actions, but it traps the one doing them deeper in karma. Tamas is the guna of darkness, destruction, and depression.

**The three gunas** **drive every action that people take.** However, the gunas are a thing of _prakriti_, or physical matter, and they trick people into egotism and obsession with the results of those actions.

Though every action comes from one of the three gunas, someone who understands the gunas’ true nature and isn’t distracted by them can perform actions selflessly—concerned only for their dharma and the world around them, rather than seeking any material rewards for their work. **Krishna advises Arjuna not to be ruled by his gunas; they’re tricks that keep him focused on his selfish interests and therefore bound to karma.**

Finally, Arjuna asks what binds people to selfish actions; why do people keep serving their own self-interest, sometimes seemingly against their will? Krishna answers that it’s the guna of rajas—passion, desire, and anger—that drives people to act selfishly.

Rajas and the selfish desires that arise from it are found in the mind and the senses. This guna tricks people into pursuing their own pleasures, rather than working to fulfill their dharma and dedicating themselves to God. Krishna advises Arjuna to master his senses and rise above selfish desire. He says that the Atman—the soul—is higher than the mind, body, or senses, and can rule them all. In other words, Arjuna’s true self must be in control: Not his physical body or even his conscious thoughts, but his true, unchangeable, divine self. **This is what Arjuna must do to free himself from karma.**

### Wise Action

Krishna mentions that he taught the secrets of karma and enlightenment to great sages many years ago. Arjuna asks how that’s possible when Krishna was born so long after the sages lived—remember that Arjuna thinks of Krishna as his childhood friend, not an incarnation of the immortal Vishnu.

Krishna replies that, like Arjuna, he’s reincarnated many times throughout history. However, unlike Arjuna, Krishna does so willingly and remembers his past lives. Through his _maya_—a word which means magic or illusion—Vishnu manifests in a mortal body when he needs to protect the world and restore the rule of dharma. **In other words, he comes when people have forgotten their destinies and are acting against the laws of the universe, like the Kauravas are doing by trying to seize the throne that’s meant for Yudhishthira.**

While on the subject of reincarnation, Krishna reiterates that people who aren’t fooled by the bodies they temporarily inhabit—who recognize that their true selves are divine and unchangeable, and are part of Brahman, the ultimate universal truth—are able to break free of karma and be rejoined with the divine.

The reason for this is that people who act from a place of self-interest become karmically bound by their actions. People who think of themselves as the ones taking action, and do so for personal reasons, incur karma. That’s why knowledge and wise action, done in the spirit of selfless service, are the keys to breaking free of reincarnation.

#### Different Paths to God

Krishna explains that, while wise and selfless actions are one path, there are many ways to find and join with him and Brahman. Some people make material offerings, while others offer their selfless actions, as Krishna is telling Arjuna to do. Some seek him through meditation, restraining their senses and gaining mastery over their physical bodies through asceticism (self-deprivation), offering up their bodies and experiences to the gods.

In every case, both the process of offering and the thing that’s offered are part of Brahman. Krishna says that all the things he just listed are different types of service, and service leads people to remove their karma and rejoin with Brahman. However, those who act selfishly and don’t try to serve will never rejoin with Brahman. Such people have no place to call their own in this world or any afterlife to come, and they’ll never feel content or peaceful.

**Having said that, Krishna then clarifies that wisdom is a greater offering than any material sacrifice because the end goal of all this work is to find spiritual wisdom—that is, understanding of the true self, of Vishnu, and of Brahman.** He advises Arjuna to seek out people who already have such wisdom and to have them teach him. Once Arjuna understands the true nature of himself and the universe, he’ll never again be fooled by physical attachments or desires. He’ll never again have to doubt himself, and therefore he’ll be able to do his duty—such as fighting the Kauravas—happily and selflessly.
