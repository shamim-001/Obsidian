## Chapters 10, 17, 19: Myths That Sabotage 10X Success

Just as following others’ advice undermines 10X goal setting, believing conventional wisdom can keep us from taking the 10X-level action necessary for extraordinary success.

Some of the most harmful business myths in terms of undermining success involve competition, customer satisfaction, and time management.

### Myth 1: Competition

A tenet of capitalism is that competition is good. While that may be true from a consumer standpoint (it can create more choices), when your goal is extraordinary success, competition is a limiting concept. For 10X success, you need to dominate, not compete.

When you’re competing with others, you’re focused on what they’re doing, which makes it difficult to think outside the box. The most successful people and companies look forward rather than at what others are doing—they create rather than copy or improve.

(Shortform note: For venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s thoughts on why competition is destructive, [read our summary of his book Zero to One here](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/zero-to-one/1-page-summary).)

#### Don’t Compete—Dominate

Here are some ways to dominate rather than compete:

- **Do what no one else is doing either because they can’t or won’t.** This creates a space in the market and gives you an advantage. For example, Cardone created a new sales process called “information-assisted selling.” Expand into areas where others are pulling out. Adopt “only practices”: things _only_ your company does.
- **Don’t play by others’ rules**. Norms and traditions hinder innovation. Your solution should be the only one that people—including your competitors—think of. For example, Xerox so dominated the copier market at one point that copying was referred to as Xeroxing. Similarly, Cardone’s goal was to make his name synonymous with sales training.
- **Learn from would-be competitors, but don’t emulate them**. Walmart founder Sam Walton visited other top-performing chains to see what they did well—then dominated at those practices to such an extent that the others dropped them. He turned others’ specialties into his own unique advantages.
- **Outwork everyone else**. Although you may have fewer resources to promote your business, you can do 10 times as much social media posting, cold calling and visits, email solicitations, and networking. Act at levels others consider over the top or unreasonable.

Devote all of your thinking and actions to dominating your market, not competing.

### Myth 2: Time Management

The focus of so many seminars and self-help articles on time management undermines 10X thinking. People think in terms of having a shortage of time and needing to achieve balance by giving up things they want. Instead, **focus on maximizing your time by devoting it to 10X-level goals and action**.

#### Balance Versus Abundance

When people think about improving time management, their goal is usually balance. However, it’s either/or thinking that limits your success—for instance, you might think you can’t have a successful career and be a good husband or father at the same time.

But you _can_ have success in every area—career, family, health, hobbies, and psychological well-being—simultaneously. **Rather than asking how you can improve time management and balance, you should be asking how you can have everything you want in abundance**.

When you achieve 10X success, you have what you want at such levels that you aren’t at risk of losing it. If you’re unhappy or worried about any area of life, your problem isn’t balance, it’s lack of success. Remember, success is your duty: Stop thinking about trade-offs and start thinking in terms of having everything.

#### Maximize Your Time

Most people who worry about time management don’t know how much time they have available, or what’s most important for them to do in that time—which means they can’t manage it. However, instead of managing your time, you should focus on maximizing it. **You’ll always have a shortage or imbalance if you don’t do enough with the time you have.**

Cardone notes that people who are impressed with what he gets done often ask him whether he ever rests. But the reason he accomplishes so much isn’t that he forgoes rest—it’s that he knows how much time he has and what his priorities are, and he assumes responsibility for pursuing his goals with maximum effort in that time.

To maximize your time, you need to:

- **Focus on your priorities**: Make success your duty by setting clear priorities (10X goals). Decide how much success you want, in what areas. Then spend the majority of your time on actions that create the success you want in these areas.
- **Understand how much time you have and how you’re using it**: Track what you’re doing with your time so you can identify and eliminate activities and habits that aren’t contributing to your goals. Anything you’re doing that’s not contributing to your success is wasting your time.
- **Increase or multiply your time with the 10X Rule**: You can, in effect, increase time by getting more done in the time available. If Cardone can make 15 phone calls in 15 minutes while another person takes an hour to make the calls, he has 45 more minutes available to him than the other person has. Most people aren’t fully productive at work—if you work harder, it not only creates more time, but also generates more rewards so your work is more enjoyable.

When your life changes and you adjust your priorities, then adjust your schedule so you’re still doing what’s most important and maximizing your time. For example, when Cardone and his wife had a child, they reset their family priorities while maintaining control of their time. Cardone began getting up an hour earlier each day to spend time with his daughter before work while his wife got additional sleep. Also, by getting the child up earlier, they could put her to bed earlier so they had time with each other. Their solution accommodated his work priority of ensuring his family’s financial success, as well as his priority of spending time with his family.

If you start by committing yourself to success as a duty and maximize your time by performing at 10X levels, you’ll have the time you need to achieve success as you’ve defined it.

### Myth 3: Customer Satisfaction

Most companies focus on customer satisfaction instead of on increasing their customers**.** Customer satisfaction refers to the extent to which your product or service meets customer expectations after they buy it. It’s important to customer loyalty, and it’s usually measured through customer surveys.

But many companies do too little to get customers in the first place. They don’t do enough to draw attention to their products, and salespeople often don’t even ask the customer to buy (mystery shopper surveys show this repeatedly). The reason businesses fail is usually that they have too few customers, rather than having a poor product.

Companies fixated on customer satisfaction worry about hurting their brand with aggressive sales efforts, or with generating complaints. But as noted above, most companies actually are under-aggressive. Further, while you can’t totally prevent complaints, you can use them as opportunities to communicate with customers.

When you put 10X levels of effort into acquiring new customers, the satisfaction issue tends to take care of itself.

#### How to Increase Customers

Companies like Google and Starbucks are highly successful because customer acquisition is their first priority—for instance, Starbucks attracts customers by making it easy and convenient to buy coffee. In fact, companies that truly deliver the greatest customer satisfaction don’t talk about service; growth in customers is their way of doing business.

You can’t satisfy a customer until you create a customer. Cardone focuses on 10X efforts to acquire customers, then overdelivers.

Some ways to increase your number of customers are:

- **Be aggressive**: If you don’t go all out to get attention, your product won’t be noticed. You need to attract investors, supporters, and customers (the latter requires earning their business and closing deals).
- **Put your priorities in the right order**: acquisition, loyalty, referrals, more acquisition.

1. Work at 10X levels to acquire customers with a product you’ve put 10X effort into creating.
2. During the acquisition process, impress customers with your people and product.
3. Build loyalty through marketing, support, and generating additional purchases.

- **Survey non-customers** (those who considered your product but didn’t buy it). Ask about their experience with your processes, for example:
    - How long were you in the store or on the website?
    - Did anyone offer to demonstrate the product or answer questions?
    - Did anyone show you additional products?
    - Did a salesperson make a proposal or ask you to buy?
    - Were you greeted by a manager?

When you put customer acquisition first, the other necessary steps—product development, process improvement, and promotion—fall into place, all of which enhance customer satisfaction.
