## Part 1 | Introduction to the Habits: Change Your Perspective

_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ distills timeless wisdom into **seven lifelong practices for building a successful, fulfilling life**. Collectively, the seven habits help you to identify and accomplish the things that are most important to you.

Before we dive into the habits, let’s examine Covey’s approach and goal for readers who adopt the seven habits.

Covey writes that in order to improve your behaviors, yourself, and your life, you must first examine and shift your paradigms, which are the lenses through which you see the world. Your paradigms, or perspectives, shape how you interpret your situations and surroundings, and your interpretations dictate your behavior; thus, **changing your _perspective_ changes your _behavior_.** Taking this a step further, your behaviors determine your outcomes, which collectively shape your life.

Consider this example of how perspectives, interpretations, behaviors, and results are intertwined:

**Perspective #1:** A supervisor believes that people act primarily for their own gain.

**Interpretation #1:** She notices that her subordinates seldom take the initiative to start tasks, and she assumes (per her perspective) that this is because employees slack off given the opportunity.

**Behavior #1:** She micromanages her team in order to keep everyone on task.

**Result #1:** Her micromanaging actually _causes_ the people on her team to hesitate to initiate tasks, because she interferes so much that they don’t feel that they have the freedom to act independently.

Now, imagine the supervisor in this scenario takes a different perspective.

**Perspective #2:** The supervisor shifts her perspective to believe that people are intrinsically motivated to do a good job.

**Interpretation #2:** When she sees her team members taking an unexpected approach to a task, she assumes they’re being innovative—not slacking off—because her perspective dictates that they are invested in the team’s collective success.

**Behavior #2:** She gives employees freedom to work independently and checks in periodically to provide support.

**Result #2:** Her subordinates are empowered to tackle each project with their best effort, even if they approach things differently than their supervisor would. Additionally, this freedom shows the workers that their supervisor has confidence in them, which motivates them to work hard and perform.

Covey explains that **everyone has a patchwork of perspectives that are influenced by a lifetime of exposure to the world**—family, education, work, religion, friends, and culture. Ironically, although our perspectives determine all of our thoughts, actions, and emotions, we are so accustomed to them—like a fish to water—that we seldom even realize that they exist, let alone question their accuracy. For example, your political beliefs are a lens through which you view events and people. Think of the last time that you responded emotionally to a president’s speech (whether positive or negative); how much did you pause to question _why_ you felt that way, and what perspectives colored your interpretation of that speech?

> **_Awaken the Giant Within_: Perspectives Stem From Your Subconscious**
> 
> Whether internally or externally focused, self-improvement ultimately focuses on changing behaviors—and that leads to an inevitable question: Why do we do what we do? While Covey attributes it to perspectives, **Tony** **Robbins argues that subconscious associations and thought patterns drive your actions.**
> 
> Robbins essentially attributes your behavior to two factors:
> 
> - **[Neuro-associations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-2)**—These are the negative and positive associations embedded in your brain wiring, based on your past experiences (for example, if you felt happy while listening to a particular song, you’ll then associate that song with pleasure). Every action and inaction is motivated by a subconscious urge to avoid things that trigger negative associations and seek things that trigger positive ones. (Later, we’ll detail Robbins’s step-by-step strategy for reprogramming your neuro-associations.)
>     
> - **[Master System](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/part-2-chapter-11)**—This is your internal operating system, which controls how you interpret the world and what you think, feel, and do in response. It comprises five elements: your present mental and emotional state, your habitual self-talk, your values, your beliefs about relationships, and the thoughts and memories that reinforce your beliefs. According to Robbins, you can change each of these five elements to collectively alter your Master System.
>     

### Why It Matters

Covey’s suggestion to shift your perspective in order to change your life is based on what he calls a “Character Ethic,” which we’ll call the internal approach. **The internal approach focuses on shifting your perspective to support the behaviors you want to adopt; he posits that this is the only way to make lasting behavioral changes.**

By contrast, a “Personality Ethic,” which we’ll call the external approach, emphasizes skills and practices that affect your public image, attitudes, and behaviors. According to Covey, this method offers quick-fix solutions—how to be more charming, make people like you, and influence people to do what you want. However, these tricks don’t address fundamental internal traits, and so they generally only work temporarily. Covey argues that if you lack the internal foundation, quick-fix tactics eventually start looking insincere to other people and stop working.

Adopting personality improvements without first establishing the necessary character traits is like building a house in reverse order. If you try to focus on window dressing and decorating without first pouring a solid foundation, the house will inevitably crumble. **Covey’s approach in the book, therefore, is to focus on internal traits in Part 2, and only then develop skills to improve your external relationships in Part 3.**

> **Internal and External Approaches Today**
> 
> When _7 Habits_ was published in 1989, Covey saw the self-improvement book market as suffused with externally focused guides. He might be pleased to see a wealth of best-selling self-improvement books available today that are internally focused. For example:
> 
> - _[Grit](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit/1-page-summary)_ discusses the character trait of grit, the combination of passion and perseverance, as a major contributor to success.
>     
> - Likewise, _[Mindset](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindset/1-page-summary)_ discusses the benefit of a growth mindset, the belief that your abilities are not fixed and can grow with practice and effort.
>     
> - _[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck)_ approaches self-fulfillment internally, by encouraging you to care less about things that don’t matter and don’t make you happy.
>     
> - Habit formation books like _[Atomic Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits)_ and _[The Power of Habit](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-habit/1-page-summary)_ give a fundamental, psychology-rooted approach to developing good habits.
>     
> 
> However, quick fixes through the external approach are still in high demand.
> 
> - _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)_ lists dozens of principles on influencing and manipulating people.
>     
> - _[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/1-page-summary)_ remains a perennial bestseller.
>     
> - _[The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-4-hour-workweek)_ describes a process for achieving financial freedom and the lifestyle of a “four-hour workweek” through building a business, without much discussion of the character traits that might lead to success.

### How To

Since your perspectives are foundational to how you see yourself, others, and the world around you, Covey says changing them is a multistep process:

1. Become aware of your current perspectives.
2. Determine what you want your perspectives to be, based on your principles; put another way, identify what perspectives would produce the behavior you want.
3. Shift your perspectives.

#### Step 1: Become Aware of Your Perspectives

Since our perspectives define how we see the world, we generally don’t notice or evaluate them—we’re focused on the picture through the frame, not the frame itself. Therefore, **the first step to changing your perspectives is to become aware of your starting point.**

(Shortform note: Robbins explains why _awareness_ of the problem is half the battle to self-improvement. We subconsciously adopt [values (such as freedom or success)](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-12) and [beliefs (for instance, you can do anything you put your mind to)](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-4)—two of the five elements of your operating system. If those values and beliefs cause disempowering behaviors, ignorance of them can sabotage Herculean efforts at self-improvement.)

Covey doesn’t specify _how_ to become aware of your perspectives, but he suggests that:

- **Simply discovering that everyone has unique perspectives can initiate self-reflection that leads you to recognize your own distinct perspectives.** Additionally, understanding how perspectives form—through experiences, community, and cultural influences—can lead you down productive paths.

> As you embark on this introspection, it’s important to know that [not all methods of self-reflection lead to an accurate self-awareness](https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it). Research shows that “why”-centered introspection (such as, “Why did I miss my deadline?”) often causes you to draw wrong, unproductive conclusions (like, “I’m undisciplined and incompetent”).
> 
> By contrast, “what” questions (like, “What caused me to miss my deadline?”) lead to more constructive, accurate insights (such as, “I overcommitted and underestimated how much time I would need to complete the assignment”).

- **Examining the problems you face could illuminate the perspectives that may be causing those issues.** For example, if you worry constantly that your spouse is losing interest and will cheat on you, self-reflection could help you realize that your spouse is actually entirely trustworthy and committed—rather, the real problem is your perspective, which makes you distrust them based on your parents’ relationship, the media you consume, and your previous relationships. (Shortform note: Some worries are the result of anxiety or, more specifically, [catastrophizing](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320844)—assuming the worst in the present or future. One way to combat irrational concerns is to [focus on things you know to be true](https://www.fastcompany.com/90519011/how-to-stop-catastrophizing-and-reduce-your-anxiety), based on concrete evidence.)
- **Encountering information that contradicts your perspective forces you to notice—and potentially examine—the discrepancy.** For instance, if you’re driving and someone speeds by, destroying your sideview mirror, you may assume they’re just a reckless driver. However, when they pull over and you approach the car, you see that a woman in the passenger’s seat is visibly pregnant and groaning. Immediately, the perspective through which you viewed the situation changes.

> **Disruptive Information Leads to Perspective Changes**
> 
> Encountering contradictory information is the first step in scientific paradigm shifts as Thomas Kuhn describes them in _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions)_, where Covey picked up the term “paradigm shift.” According to Kuhn, [paradigm shifts are a multi-step process](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/chapter-1):
> 
> - **Research uncovers an anomaly**—something that doesn’t align with the current paradigm.
>     
> - **The anomaly leads to a crisis**, as scientists are unable to resolve the discrepancy. During the period of crisis, some scientists attempt to dismiss the anomaly in order to maintain the current paradigm, while others take the anomaly as a sign to reject the old paradigm and set out to find a more accurate one.
>     
> - Eventually, **the crisis gives way to a revolution**, in which the old paradigm is replaced with a new one in a paradigm shift.
>     

#### Step 2: Center Your Perspectives in Principle

Once you’ve recognized where you’re coming from, you have to determine where you’re going. Covey argues that **becoming effective requires you to center your perspectives in universal principles.** Universal principles include traits that are universally admired, such as fairness, integrity, honesty, growth, and patience.

(Shortform note: Covey seems to endorse adopting _all_ of the universal principles—but other self-help and business authors suggest zeroing in on a handful of core values that matter most to you. The idea is that **it’s more practical to focus on a few key principles when you’re solving problems and making decisions.** As Brene Brown explains in _Dare to Lead_, [if you have too many values, they lose their meaning](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-2).)

Covey posits that, **while your perspectives dictate your _actions_, principles determine the _consequences_ of your actions.** As such, the most effective way of living is to align your paradigms with principles, because otherwise your actions will conflict with universal principles and lead to negative consequences—for instance, being dishonest (violating the principle of honesty) could damage your relationships or get you fired.

> **Kant: Moral Principles Are Universally True**
> 
> Whereas Covey argues that _consequences_ measure how principled your actions are, German philosopher Immanuel **Kant judges an action’s morality [based on the motivation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/) and whether the behavior would be universally appropriate.** He calls this standard the Categorical Imperative.
> 
> First, your act can only be considered moral if your motivation is to fulfill your duty to live morally. As long as your motivation is to abide by this duty, the act is moral regardless of whether it is something you want to do, something you don’t want to do, something that benefits you and others, or something that ends poorly. This view accounts for bad luck, in contrast to Covey’s basis on actual consequences (more on the flaws in his argument below).
> 
> Second, you must consider whether you’d want everyone to act the same way in a similar situation. For example, if you want to write part of your child’s paper to ensure they pass the class, consider what it’d be like if every parent did this. In that world, would it still make sense for you to do your child’s work? (Probably not, because the teachers would catch on.)

Covey argues that principles shape the objective reality, while your perspectives shape your _interpretation_ of that reality—he uses a recurring analogy of paradigms as maps, and objective reality as the terrain itself. You use the map to navigate the terrain, but if your map isn’t to scale (as in, if your perspective is not aligned with reality-defining principles) then you’ll face the consequences caused by that disparity.

> **Principled Living Doesn’t Guarantee Positive Results**
> 
> In his argument for principle-centered paradigms, Covey focuses on how universal principles govern human behavior and societal functioning. This essentially says that **principled living means acting in a way that’s in line with others’ norms and expectations.** It makes sense that Covey would present this as the ideal because, as we’ll discuss, his seven habits are designed to foster collaboration and cooperation.
> 
> However, this argument is reductionist and glosses over numerous possibilities:
> 
> - **Laws and policies may not hold up—and may even actively punish—principles like honesty and human dignity, especially under oppressive regimes.** In those cases, a person could act based on principles and still face grave consequences. For example, [a Chinese journalist named Zhang Zhan was arrested for reporting truthfully](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/world/asia/china-Zhang-Zhan-covid-convicted.html) on the COVID-19 pandemic from Wuhan and scrutinizing the government’s response. Another example: Under Hitler’s reign, non-Jews could be persecuted for helping Jews.
>     
> - **Cultural norms sometimes contradict universal principles.** For instance, the consequences will probably be worse if you are honest and tell your mother-in-law that you hate her cooking than if you simply lie about it.
>     
> - **Sometimes you can do everything right and still face bad luck.** For example, you can be the model employee—constantly displaying principles like honesty and integrity—and still face layoffs or get fired by a tyrannical boss.
>     
> 
> If you believe Covey’s assertion but fall into one of these exceptions, you’re likely to misdiagnose the issue: Did you follow the wrong principle? Did you have the right principle but didn’t follow it closely enough?

#### Shortform Step 3: Shift Your Perspectives

Granted, noticing your paradigms is the first step to changing them—but what do you do next? Covey doesn’t specify the steps to changing your paradigm, but some of his self-improvement peers have offered suggestions.

**Prescription #1: Change Your Thoughts**

In the early self-help classic _As A Man Thinketh_, author James Allen also [emphasizes the importance of addressing the cause of your problems](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/as-a-man-thinketh/take-control-of-your-thoughts), rather than trying to fix the _symptoms_. And at the root of your problems, he argues, are your thoughts: When you think negatively, your words and actions are negative, and that elicits negative reactions from others, creating a vicious cycle. By contrast, when you think positive thoughts, you radiate and receive positivity in a virtuous cycle.

In order to take control of your thoughts, Allen suggests reflecting on your past experiences and then tracing them back to the seedling thoughts that created those realities. This exercise helps you see how your thoughts shape your life, which motivates you to think more positively. With that motivation, make an effort to notice your thoughts and try to keep them positive. Over time, positive thinking will become a habit.

**Prescription #2: Reprogram Your Neuro-Associations**

Nearly a century after Allen published his advice, Tony Robbins took this concept to a more cellular level. In _Awaken the Giant Within_, Robbins argues that at [the root of all your actions and decisions are neuro-associations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-2) that link certain experiences with _pain_ and others with _pleasure_. For example, if you have a happy memory of listening to a particular song, you subconsciously associate that song with pleasure; if you were unhappy—even if for a reason unrelated to the song—you connect that song with pain. Using these neuro-associations as a guide, your brain directs you to make choices that replicate pleasurable associations and avoid painful ones.

To change these neuro-associations, and thus alter your behavior, Robbins describes a six-step [reprogramming process called Neuro-Associative Conditioning](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-3):

1. **Identify the result you want as well as the reason you haven’t yet achieved it.** For example, you want to be more open-minded to other political paradigms, but you have negative associations about people on the other side of the aisle.
2. **Vividly envision the consequences of _not_ making the change you want** (such as losing a close friend who has different political beliefs). Then, vividly envision the benefits of successfully making the change (such as having a more open, honest relationship with your friend).
3. **Whenever you catch yourself slipping into your old habit, do something random to snap out of it.** For instance, if you feel yourself getting defensive during a political conversation, stop and say the first knock-knock joke you can think of—then resume the discussion.
4. **Come up with a positive behavior to replace the old one.** For example, if you tend to interrupt people when you get worked up during a debate, make a point of counting to three after they’ve finished talking before you begin to respond.
5. **Reinforce your new behavior by rehearsing it in your mind.** For instance, imagine yourself listening attentively and speaking calmly in a heated political discussion with your friend. Replay the scene repeatedly and consistently.
6. **Maintain your new habit.** Notice your behavior when you find yourself in those situations, and be careful not to slip into old habits.

### Going Deeper

Covey notes that **another benefit of evaluating your perspectives is that you become more open-minded to others’ perceptions, which helps to expand your view of the world.**

Normally, when we’re unaware of our unique perspectives and how they shape us, we assume that people who don’t agree with us are simply wrong. Covey says the mistake here is not realizing that their beliefs and actions only appear wrong through our own lens, but are completely valid through theirs. In reality, since each person’s experiences create different lenses, two people with different perspectives can look at the same facts, interpret them completely differently, and both be rational. For example, one person might think that a particular economic policy is _killing_ jobs, while another person believes it is _creating_ them—and each belief may be true in their respective communities.

Covey maintains that **when you recognize that your individual experiences and influences frame your views, you can understand that _other people’s_ distinct experiences and influences have also shaped _their_ views**, and that insight can breed empathy.

> **Paradigm Awareness Improves Religious Tolerance and Empathy**
> 
> The principle that awareness of your own unique lens fosters empathy for other people’s extends to religious beliefs, as well. **Each faith is a paradigm that shapes its followers’ views of morals, justice, and how society should function.** In _[21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Yuval Noah Harai notes](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/campaign/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/)_ that [monotheists are more often intolerant of others’ faiths](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/chapter-12) and rituals than polytheists—because if you believe yours is the only right way (the only true God, the only way to salvation), then everyone else must be wrong.
> 
> It’s critical to break this barrier by taking the initiative to evaluate our perspectives because:
> 
> - Most of us tend to [surround ourselves with people whose lives and backgrounds are similar](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/year-of-living-better/how-to-be-more-empathetic#:~:text=along%20the%20way.-,Practice%20Empathy,anyone%20can%20do%20to%20improve.&text=Research%20has%20shown%20that%20empathy,than%20just%20its%20personal%20effect.) to our own, which often means their paradigms are also similar (for instance, people who are active in their religious community are surrounded by others who share the same paradigm). That homogeneity seldom pushes us to question our views.
>     
> - Widening your perspective improves your collaborative skills at work and makes you more empathetic with your friends, family, and community. ([It even improves your health](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-empathy/201812/five-ways-empathy-is-good-your-health).)
>     

With this foundation in place, the rest of this guide builds on these ideas by explaining how Covey defines the effectiveness ideals that shape his seven practices and then diving into each of the habits themselves.
