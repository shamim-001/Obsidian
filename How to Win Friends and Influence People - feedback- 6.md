## Feedback 6: Create a Reputation to Live Up To

### Principles

- **If you want to improve something about a person, act as though that trait were already one of her outstanding characteristics**. They will try to live up to that reputation, rather than disappoint you and betray their image.
- People want to feel important. Being valued for certain traits or their reputation makes them feel important, and they will work to continue feeling important.
- Shakespeare: “Assume a virtue, if you have it not.”
- (Shortform note: This is similar to the Arguments chapter “Appeal to the Best Self.”)

### Tactics

- If an excellent worker is falling short in performance, praise the person’s previous work and reputation for quality. Note that you’re giving feedback since you’re sure they’d want to know if they were falling short.
- To an angry customer: “I’ve always admired you for your patience and fairness. Please forgive us for our mistake.”
- To someone who’s rejected your ideas: “I’ve always respected your open-mindedness. I have faith that you’re big enough to change your mind if you receive new information.”
- Try this for people who are historically underappreciated and lacking in positive feedback - find a trait of theirs you want to emphasize.

### Examples

- A writer was staying in a hotel and served by a homely, dispirited servant girl. The writer pulled her aside and said, “Marie, you do not know what treasures are within you.” Unaccustomed to receiving any recognition, the girl changed her attitude and began to take better care of her face and body.
- A teacher had a child known to other teachers as a bad apple. Instead of treating the boy accordingly and causing a self-fulfilling prophecy, she reversed course: “Tommy, I hear you’re a born leader. I’m going to need your help to make this the best class in the school this year.” Then she praised his every positive action in the first few days. He quickly revised his behavior.
- A store manager had inaccurate price tags on the shelves, confusing customers. He appointed an employee Supervisor of Price Tags. This responsibility changed her attitude completely.
