## Part 2: Deep Work Practices | Chapter 4: Plan Out Time for Deep Work

After establishing what deep work is and why it’s important in Part 1, Newport moves on to explain different ways to make deep work practices part of your life. The first step he outlines is carving out time that you’ll dedicate to deep work. He warns that it’s very difficult to simply _will_ yourself to do deep work on demand. It’s much more effective to approach deep work with structure, habit, and discipline—in other words, to make deep work a _practiced ritual_.

**Ritualizing deep work is important because, without a ritual’s structure, distractions quickly get in the way.** According to Newport, distractions are anything that you’d rather be doing than deep work—such as scrolling social media, taking a nap, or hanging out with friends. You use willpower to overcome these distractions and get back on task. Newport argues that you have a finite amount of willpower each day. If you have to continuously force yourself to switch from distractions back to deep work, you’ll deplete your willpower and more easily give in to distraction. This limits you from reaching the maximum of your deep work potential.

> **The Debate Around “Willpower Depletion”**
> 
> Recent research has called the idea of willpower depletion into question—[scientists can’t replicate the results of the experiment that created the concept](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html).
> 
> This revelation isn’t all bad—the belief that willpower is a finite resource that you either have or don’t can lead to defeatist practices. Anders Ericsson, author of _Peak_, says that [the “lack of willpower” mindset creates a self-fulfilling prophecy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/peak/chapter-5): You think you don’t have the willpower to improve a skill, so you don’t practice because there’s no use in trying, so you never improve. In _Indistractable_, Nir Eyal says that [when you think of willpower as finite, you use this knowledge as an excuse to give up on overwhelming or cognitively demanding tasks in favor of low-effort activities](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-1) like watching Netflix.
> 
> These authors suggest a few different ways to overcome these thought processes.
> 
> - Ericsson suggests clearing your schedule of _everything_ other than the thing you need to do, because having difficult tasks scheduled at a specific time makes you less likely to give in to the temptation of choosing another activity.
>     
> - Eyal suggests treating your willpower as an emotion that you need to manage, like anger or sadness. When you feel a lack of willpower, think of ways you might manage it in that moment—for example, turning your attention to a relatively small or easy part of the task so you can check something off the list and get a boost of motivation.

### The Four Types of Deep Work Scheduling

**If you make deep work a ritual or habit that your autopilot defaults to, you no longer have to employ your willpower to overcome distraction.** Newport explains that not having to spend time deciding (or wrestling) between distraction and deep work increases the amount of time you can spend in deep work and reduces your rate of failure.

He says that **the most effective way to make deep work a _habit_ is to set time aside specifically for focusing on deep work**. To be successful at doing deep work in the long term, you’ll have to try out different schedules to see what best fits your lifestyle and needs. Newport offers four types of deep work schedules for consideration, each with different time requirements and efficacy.

#### Schedule Type 1: Seclusion

**Structure**: Remove as many shallow work tasks from your life as possible; delegate as many as possible to assistants. Spend nearly all your time on deep work. Like a monk, you spend your time somewhat isolated and in deep focus on your work.

- Examples: Some authors go off the grid and aren’t reachable by email or through social media. All correspondence comes in by postal mail or through their editor.

**Pros:** You get extended periods of deep work—it becomes your default working style, not something you have to plan for.

**Cons:** This isn’t feasible for most people, given the requirements of their career.

(Shortform note: This schedule requires you to avoid all shallow tasks, though often these tasks are a necessary part of life. To handle this, you’ll have to learn the essential skill of _delegation_. In _[Who Not How](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/652066/who-not-how-by-dan-sullivan-and-dr-benjamin-hardy/),_ Dan Sullivan explains that successful delegation depends on finding the best person for the job, instead of finding the best way to do the job. Instead of asking, “_How_ can I get my shallow work done with this kind of schedule?” ask, “_Who_ can I delegate my shallow work to?”)

#### Schedule Type 2: Periodic

**Structure**: Carve out regular periods each week, month, or entire parts of the year to focus on deep work. The book stresses that the period should be **at least one full day** to reach the maximum intensity of deep work. (As we’ll see in the following schedule suggestion, it’s possible to do a few daily hours of deep work, but those few hours won’t be at the intensity you would achieve in a full day of deep work.)

- Examples: You might carve out a three-day block of the week where you aren’t contactable while preserving the other two days for shallower work.

**Pros:** This is more realistic than the seclusion schedule. Setting aside at least one full day of deep work helps you reach your maximum level of focus.

**Cons:** Despite being more realistic, it’s still impractical for many workers, who have to perform certain tasks daily.

(Shortform note: Even if you’re a 9-5 office worker, it may be possible to adopt a periodic schedule—especially as companies normalize remote work. In _[The Effective Executive](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-1)_, Peter Drucker recommends working from home at least one day per week, and planning to do your most mentally demanding tasks in this isolated, focused time.)

> **Seclusion and Periodic Schedules _Won’t_ Work for Most**
> 
> These first two schedules get the most backlash from reviewers, who accuse Newport of not recognizing his privilege and presenting ideas that are impossible for most working schedules. However, Newport noted in the book that these schedules usually make people angry or defensive, and he acknowledged they aren’t possible for _most_ knowledge workers. He then added the following two schedules, which fit a wider range of lifestyles.

#### Schedule Type 3: Daily

**Structure**: Set aside a regular block of time each day to focus on deep work.

- Example: Set aside the morning (such as 8 to 11 a.m.) for deep work, before jumping into shallow work.

**Pros:** The regularity of this schedule is conducive to forming a habit, and it’s realistic for many careers and lifestyles.

**Cons:** This schedule doesn’t give the full day of deep work that the seclusion or periodic schedules can provide, and therefore you won’t reach your _maximum_ focus potential.

(Shortform note: In _[The 5 AM Club](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-am-club),_ Robin Sharma notes that the most productive part of your day is the hour right after you wake up because you’re recharged and the world is relatively quiet and distraction-free. It therefore makes sense to try to schedule your deep work time block in the early morning.)

#### Schedule Type 4: Ad Hoc

**Structure**: Find some time to do deep work whenever you can get it.

- Example: When on a trip with your family, carve out a few hours to do work before joining them for activities.

**Pros:** This is the most flexible schedule. You can do deep work at any point when it’s possible.

**Cons:** Because it’s irregular, it’s the least successful in setting up a habit. It requires the ability to switch on deep work instantaneously. Because it’s more variable, you’re more likely to run into distractions and thus more likely to consume willpower.

(Shortform note: It’s difficult to successfully achieve a level of deep work on the ad hoc schedule unless you’ve trained your ability to switch your “deep work brain” on and off at will—like a journalist, for example—or if you’re strongly driven by the belief that your work matters and that you’ll succeed. In his book _[So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/1-page-summary),_ Newport elaborates on _why_ having a strong sense of purpose is essential to doing your best work at an exceptional performance level.)

#### How Much Deep Work Should You Try to Fit Into Your Day?

Newport cautions that there _is_ a limit to how much deep work you’ll be able to accomplish per day. Anders Ericsson, author of _[Peak](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/peak)_, explains that most novices can only accomplish about an hour a day of intense concentration. **Experts who have extensive practice can expand to up to four hours, but rarely are able to exceed this**. We’ll explore techniques for training your ability to concentrate and engage in deep work for increasingly long periods in Chapter 6.

(Shortform note: Newport doesn’t discuss circumstances under which people can—and do—concentrate deeply for more than four hours at a time, [such as chess grandmasters](https://thechessworld.com/articles/training-techniques/how-many-hours-per-day-to-work-on-chess-according-to-gm-shipov/). Critics point out that this gives Newport a sort of loophole: If someone claims that they’re able to do deep work for more than four hours, he can always respond that their work must have _actually_ been shallow work.)

### Plan Out Your Days

Newport suggests several techniques for making sure you leave yourself enough time for deep work and aren’t tempted to engage in shallow work during that time.

#### Technique #1: Schedule Internet Time

**Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet. Avoid it completely outside these times.** Newport gives some tips on how to make the most of this practice:

- Keep a notepad nearby where you record the next time you’re scheduled to use the Internet, and any ideas you need to revisit once you’re online again.
- Plan your work so you don’t need the Internet to make progress. If you get stuck by not being able to access the Internet, then move on to another task. Plan better next time.
- If you do this primarily at work, then don’t stop this practice at home after work. This will undo the training you did at work.

(Shortform note: For most knowledge workers, it’s not possible to only use the Internet at certain times of the day. But if you must use the Internet all day, try using website-blocking apps like [Forest](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/forest-stay-focused-be-pr/kjacjjdnoddnpbbcjilcajfhhbdhkpgk?hl=en-GB) or [Self Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/self-control/ncaaipdfhdijmfdfmeoagmogddhkfdec?hl=en-GB) to help remove the temptation to switch your attention away from deep work.)

#### Technique #2: Plan Out Every Minute of Your Day, and Quantify Depth

Next, **plan out everything that you need to do throughout the day.** Newport says that when you set specific goals by planning out what you’ll work on in advance, you’re less likely to switch to other tasks.

(Shortform note: In _[Switch](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/switch/chapter-3)_, Chip and Dan Heath explore why advance planning helps keep us on task. They explain that humans are predisposed to decision paralysis—when you have too many options of what you _could_ work on, you’re likely to default to whatever feels easiest. On the other hand, having a clear plan of what needs to get done removes your options and the need to make a decision.)

Newport outlines three steps to planning your time in a deep work-supporting way:

##### Step 1: Plan Your Tasks

Think about the tasks that you need to complete during the day and note what time you plan to complete these tasks. Newport recommends breaking down your tasks into half-hour blocks, making sure to schedule some overrun blocks for tasks you suspect might run over their allotted time, and buffer blocks to handle emergencies that arise.

(Shortform note: In 2020, Newport released _[The Time-Block Planner](https://www.timeblockplanner.com/#timeplanner)_, which helps guide readers to create schedules broken down into half-hour increments and in alignment with their goals.)

##### Step 2: Quantify Depth

He then says to estimate and note the “deep work” complexity of each task. As a rule of thumb, **imagine how long it would take to train a smart college grad to do the task—the more time, the deeper the work.**

- Example: Executing an operational task like an analytics report may just take a week for the grad to learn. In contrast, it may take a grad months or years to reach your level of ability in researching the industry to find a new customer need.

(Shortform note: This heuristic doesn’t always work if you’ve built up a skill to the point that it’s routine. For instance, a surgeon operating may not consider a certain procedure deep work.)

Once you’ve finished quantifying the depth of your day’s tasks, look over your schedule. If your day is full of shallow tasks, Newport urges you to consider how you can replace those with deeper work.

- How much of your schedule should be shallow work? Newport suggests a guideline of 30-50% to start. Certainly, it shouldn’t be the majority of your time, but in most careers, you can’t get away with lower. Remember that for deep work beginners, it’s not unusual for an eight-hour workday to have only one hour of actual deep work.

> **What Tasks Should Be on Your Schedule?**
> 
> In _[Digital Minimalism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/digital-minimalism/chapter-2)_, Newport discusses the importance of building a schedule based on your values—decide what activities are truly aligned with your values and schedule time for them first. Then, schedule distractions (or in this context, shallow work) around it.
> 
> Recall Newport’s note that the concept of deep work doesn’t only apply to what we traditionally think of as work. **Deep work is happening whenever you’re living aligned with and focused on your values.** Because everyone’s values are different, the tasks on their schedule will be different.
> 
> - For example, a stay-at-home mom might build her schedule around spending more time with her kids and getting a new degree online. A different mother may build her schedule around advancing in her career and attending all of her daughter’s basketball games. Deep work in any of these areas requires presence and focus.

##### Step 3: Regularly Reflect on and Tweak Your Schedule

Newport says that if time runs out on a task but you have momentum and inspiration, you should keep going. This addresses the complaint that too much structure decreases serendipitous good ideas—if you’re deep in your work, keep going until those ideas happen. And in reality, structuring time to get into deep work should _increase_ the number of good ideas.

He suggests reviewing the accuracy of your time blocks at the end of each day. This will help you set more accurate goals and expectations in the future.

(Shortform note: Like many people, you may feel discouraged if you set up a schedule and then aren’t able to follow it, or if you derail your plans by giving in to distraction. Nir Eyal addresses this feeling in _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-2)_, and he explains that it’s essential to think of your schedule as an evolving experiment—you probably won’t get it right on the first try, and that’s okay. Beating yourself up for not being perfect will likely only stress you out and distract you further. Instead, think about ways that you can build a schedule better aligned to your needs and keep experimenting.)

#### Technique #3: Set Ambitious Deadlines

**Newport recommends giving yourself intense deadlines—this will force you to concentrate at the limit of your ability to make the deadline.** There’s no way you can give in to distraction and still make your deadline.

To do this, estimate how long you’d normally schedule for the task. **Then cut down the time drastically**, and set it as your deadline.

(Shortform note: Intense deadlines not only force you into focus mode but can actually make your work _better_. When you set an ambitious deadline, you create a moderate amount of emotional arousal—which, [according to the Yerkes-Dodson Law, is where you achieve peak performance](https://www.healthline.com/health/yerkes-dodson-law). In other words, people really do “work best under pressure.”)

#### Technique #4: Set a Budget With Your Boss for Shallow Work

Newport says that a common barrier to performing more deep work is the fear that your employer has expectations requiring shallow work—for example, expecting you to respond to emails immediately. Have a conversation with your boss about your schedule. He outlines several questions that should come up in this conversation:

- Start with the high-level goal: The deep work components of your time generate the most value for the company. **Does your boss agree?** It’s important that deep work not be seen as an indulgent luxury, but rather as _the best_ place to spend time.
- **Does it make sense to restructure your time to focus on deep work?**
- **What are the expectations around shallow work—such as group chats, emails, and meetings—and can you restructure your time to minimize those while still servicing the rest of the team?**

Once people know that you’ll be spending more of your time in deep work, they’ll adjust their expectations.

(Shortform note: You may be nervous about starting this conversation with your boss due to a false belief that she _demands_ that you be on call all day. Nir Eyal points out that [your boss doesn’t want you checking your email all day—she wants you to do your work](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/shortform-exclusive). If doing your work requires cutting some shallow tasks out of your schedule, chances are high that your boss will readily agree.)
