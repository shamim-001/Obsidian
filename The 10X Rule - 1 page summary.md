## 1-Page Summary

Nearly everyone seeks the “holy grail” of success, but most people fall short. In _The 10X Rule_, entrepreneur and motivational speaker Grant Cardone argues that people don’t succeed because:

1) **They misunderstand what it takes to be successful.** People mistakenly think success requires having money, connections, talent, the right education, being in the right business, or being in the right place at the right time. But these don’t guarantee success.

**Only the 10X Rule—setting extreme goals and taking extreme action to meet them—guarantees success and, unlike the above criteria, it’s available to everyone**.

2) People don’t approach success the right way. First, **they don’t set high enough goals due to “average” thinking**. They don’t want to be unrealistic or risk failure, so they set seemingly attainable goals, yet still fall short.

Second, people fail to reach their goals because **they underestimate what it will take to reach them and don’t apply enough effort**. Again, this is average thinking—they assume that by putting in a “reasonable” amount of effort they’ll succeed.

### The 10X Solution

Instead of coming from external factors (money or connections), success comes from having the right mindset. Cardone argues you need to scale up your thinking and actions by a factor of 10. The 10X Rule for success is: set goals that are 10 times bigger than the average, then work 10 times harder than average to achieve them. Cardone refers to the latter as taking “massive” action. **It takes extraordinary thinking and effort to achieve extraordinary success.**

Setting 10X goals and taking extraordinary steps to achieve them isn’t taught in business schools. But anyone who achieves extraordinary success—whether a CEO, philanthropist, entrepreneur, politician, or athlete—follows the 10X rule, whether they realize it or not. What successful athlete hasn’t devoted extraordinary effort to training and practice?

**The 10X Rule can be applied to any personal or professional goal,** whether it’s having an extraordinary marriage, starting a hugely successful business, or making $10 million.

Besides reaching your goals, living by the 10X standard provides other benefits, including a sense of purpose, increased self-confidence, a way to overcome fears and procrastination, renewed energy, and greater satisfaction. Further, it’s a way to stand out from the crowd, fulfill your potential, and create the life you want.

In business, a think big/act big mindset enables you to overcome obstacles such as competition, economic downturns, disruptions, and client resistance.

**Operating at a 10X level is a discipline for reaching all goals, it’s a way of life, and the way to handle all tasks and projects**.

### Why Set 10X Goals?

Most people set modest goals. **Our goals are based on beliefs drummed into us by others, who define what constitutes “enough” or what’s realistic**. We’re told that if we set unrealistic goals, we’ll just fall short and get discouraged; that we should be happy with “enough” to live comfortably.

However, you’ve probably been disappointed more often in the past by setting goals that are too low rather than too high—because when you set low targets and hit them, you know it’s not much of an achievement and you feel dissatisfied.

But if you set a huge (10X) goal and come up short, you’ll still achieve more than you would have in hitting a lesser goal. For example, if you originally set a goal of making $100,000, then boosted it to a 10X goal of $1 million, wouldn’t you rather come up short on the $1 million goal?

**When you aim for only “enough” to be comfortable, you’re limiting yourself to being happy with just a little success**. As a result, you’ll put in a limited amount of effort, get little in return, and won’t keep it very long.

**Extraordinary or 10X goals are, by definition, bigger than what most people can imagine and achieve**.

### How to Set 10X Goals

Since your daily actions determine the course of your life, do the following:

- Write down your goals two times every day to fix them in your mind. Make it the first thing you do each morning and last thing you do at night, every day until you achieve them. Also, revise them during the day as you think of ways to improve them.
- Choose goals just beyond your reach, which will motivate you. If your goals are so small that you aren’t compelled to think about them daily, you’ll lose interest.

#### What to Write

- Set goals that encourage or require you to live up to your potential. Approach goal setting with a 10X mindset (big goals, followed by big action equals big success). Remember, the bigger the goal, the more motivated you’ll be to overcome resistance. Further, only big goals generate so much success that they can’t be scuttled by unexpected problems, such as financial or health emergencies.
- Word your goals as though you’ve already accomplished them. Here are examples of Cardone’s 10X goals:
    - I’m in great physical shape
    - I have a net worth of $100 million
    - My income is over $1 million a month
    - I own a home with no debt
    - I create unique programs that improve people’s lives
    - I have a top-rated TV show
- Align your goals with a larger purpose to generate additional motivation and energy. To do this, you must be clear about the reason for each goal. For example, if your goal is to save $100 million, include what you want to do with the money, such as financing a dream like post-graduate education, buying a ranch, or helping your community.
- Align your actions with your goals and purposes. When you need to be taking 10X action to achieve 10X goals, don’t spend your time doing unrelated things. For example, when Cardone worked at McDonald’s as a young man, he hated the work because it wasn’t helping him achieve any significant goal (he didn’t know what his goals were). But a coworker loved the job because it aligned with his goal—he wanted to learn the business and open his own franchises, which he eventually did.

The bigger (and further from average) your goals are—and the better they’re aligned with your purpose—the more they’ll energize you and drive your actions.

### 10X Action

There are numerous books, programs, and speakers providing advice on how to succeed in business by setting goals, practicing time management, being disciplined and persistent, and managing your career.

But **you don’t hear much, if anything, about the one mindset or behavior that will guarantee extraordinary success: extraordinary effort**.

In looking at his own life, Cardone realized that the common denominator in each of his successes was that he put in 10 times more effort than anyone else did. For every sales presentation, call, or appointment that others made, he made 10 presentations, calls, or appointments.

When he began investing in real estate, he looked at 10 times as many properties as he could buy. He started a business without a business plan and little knowledge or connections, but through extreme effort, he made it a success. Whatever he did was done in a big way, with massive action.

**Most of the problems in people’s lives—from failed diets to financial or relationship problems—stem from not taking enough action**.

#### Four Levels of Action

Applying enough effort is more important than having the right idea or business plan. Most people don’t do enough (take sufficient action) to succeed. Everyone opts for one of these four action levels, but only the fourth brings success:

1) **Not doing anything**: People who choose passivity have given up on their dreams. They’re bored and lack motivation or a sense of purpose.

2) **Retreating**: People who retreat or backpedal often do so because they fear action will have negative consequences.

3) **Taking average action**: Most people put in an average amount of effort, or enough to get by. But an average level of action is the biggest hindrance to success because it seems most acceptable, but produces only average results.

4) **Taking extreme action**: Only people who apply extreme action achieve extreme success. However, in the shorter run, be aware that approaching any task with extreme action creates problems—for instance, more work or more clients to service—but it leads to more success. **If you’re not creating problems, it’s a sign you’re not putting in enough effort**.

Doing nothing and retreating result in failure. Taking average action produces no better than average results. Only extreme action guarantees success.

### Success as a Duty

People often think of success as an option, something that may or may not happen; they wait for it to show up. Cardone’s life changed when he stopped waiting for success and began thinking of it as his ethical obligation—that is, as a duty to himself, his family, and his company.

**Those who treat success as an option or who make excuses for not succeeding aren’t living up to their potential**. And not living up to your potential is unethical. This applies to every aspect of life: work, marriage and family, health, faith, social contribution, and legacy.

When you begin thinking of success as your responsibility rather than an option, you behave differently. You take the idea of living up to your potential—creating 10X success—seriously because it not only affects you, but also your family, company, coworkers, and colleagues. And because failing to do so is unethical.

### Getting Started With 10X

Instead of following their dreams, most people set average goals based on what others think is possible. The 10X Rule is for those who aren’t satisfied with average and who are determined to create an exceptional life.

To get started, **make a list of your goals, then a list of actions, then start taking those actions.**

Don’t give in to the urge to wait, or try to talk yourself out of acting. Changing your life is like being in a vehicle that’s stuck in the mud; you only need enough traction to move a few inches. It will get messy, but soon you’ll make real progress.

Act now (not a few minutes from now) and keep acting with the assurance that by doing everything in your power in the present, you’re creating the future. **Nothing—whether it’s financial problems, fears, past failures, or other challenges—is bigger than your ability to dream and act at 10X levels.**
