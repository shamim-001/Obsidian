## Part 4: How to Create a Financial Strategy You Can Stick To

You now know what to include in your financial strategy—but how do you make sure your strategy is one you can stick to over decades? Housel names three principles to keep in mind: Expect your future goals to change, prioritize sense over logic, and develop a survival mentality.

### Lesson #11: Expect Your Future Goals to Change

In Chapter 14, Housel shares one critical key to developing a long-term strategy you can stick to over decades: **Expect your future goals to change, react quickly when they do, and build flexibility into your financial plan.**

As we’ve seen, one major element of financial success is letting your money sit as long as possible so it accumulates the maximum amount of compound interest. Housel posits that leaving your money alone for this long is difficult partly because people change, but since they’re unable to predict _how_ they’ll change, they don’t invest their money in ways that will work for their future selves.

Housel explains that **when** **making financial plans, most people fall victim to the end-of-history illusion**, a psychological phenomenon where you recognize that you’ve changed significantly from who you were, but you don’t expect to change significantly from who you are now. But in reality, you are likely to change just as much in the future as you did in the past. For example, if you’ve changed your career twice between 20 and 30, you might recognize that you’ve changed significantly since 20, but you expect that you won’t change your career again for the rest of your life.

(Shortform note: Why do people fall for the end-of-history illusion? The psychologists who discovered the end-of-history illusion (which they also called the end-of-history effect) suggest a few possibilities. One is that [believing you don’t change is comforting](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/study-in-science-shows-end-of-history-illusion.htm): It’s terrifying to imagine that, for example, your future self is so different from your current self that any plans you make now—both financial and otherwise—won’t work for them.)

How can you reconcile the reality that you’ll change with the necessity of leaving your money alone?

Housel makes two recommendations.

**#1: Don’t make extreme financial plans.**

Specifically, Housel recommends avoiding any plans that involve extremes in your commute, savings, or personal time, and creating plans that involve moderation in all three areas instead.

(Shortform note: What exactly counts as extremes in your commute, savings, or personal time? Housel never defines this, and what counts as moderation in all three will likely differ drastically depending on your age, location, and personal location. So instead of comparing yourself to others not in your situation, consider going with the options that _feel_ moderate to you, even if they don’t align with what is actually average.)

Why? First, Housel explains, **if you make an extreme financial plan, you may regret your choices.** For example, an entrepreneur who devotes 100% of his time to building his company and zero time on his relationships may be happy in his 20s. But he may regret this decision at 45, when he’s financially successful but has no loved ones to share this success with.

(Shortform note: If you do make an extreme financial plan and end up regretting it, one way to ease the pain is to [find the silver lining: Learn something from the regret and apply it to your actions in the future](https://shortform.com/app/article/8-ways-to-be-kinder-to-yourself-in-2020-tim-herrera-the-new-york-times). That way, even if you don’t get your new goal, you won’t feel as badly. You’ll also likely feel less stressed about having to work harder for your new goal because you won’t consider the time a total waste.)

Second, Housel states, **if you make an extreme financial plan and change it later, you won’t be able to take full advantage of compound returns.** For example, you may believe that you never want to settle in one place and thus happily survive off part-time jobs that pay just enough to let you travel the world cheaply. But if you eventually tire of traveling and want to settle down, you may discover that you can’t afford to retire where you want. Had you taken slightly better-paying jobs and saved some money, you would have a decade’s worth of compound returns—but you can never get that money back now.

(Shortform note: Remember that you may change your financial plan not because you _want_ to but because you _have_ to. If this happens, you may be more exposed to financial ruin if you’ve been following an extreme financial plan than if you’d been following a more moderate one. This is because extreme plans can help you [achieve one goal but can leave you vulnerable to things going wrong in other areas of your finances](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/saving-and-budgeting/articles/2018-04-24/the-downsides-to-extreme-personal-finance).)

**#2. Allow yourself to change**.

When your values and goals inevitably do change, Housel recommends, accept this change and adjust your strategy accordingly as soon as possible. In doing so, **you minimize the effects of the sunk cost fallacy**: our tendency to stick to choices we made because of the effort we’ve invested in them, even though we can never get that effort back.

If you fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy, you might, for example, spend years being miserable as a lawyer because you already invested three years in law school. But law school is a sunk cost, or an investment you can’t recuperate: No matter what you do, you’ll never get those three years back. The faster you admit that you’re miserable and change your career plan, the less time you’ll spend being miserable as a lawyer.

(Shortform note: Refusing to change your current actions due to the sunk cost fallacy doesn’t just affect your finances; [it can also lead you to stay in an unsatisfying relationship](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-defining-decade/finding-love). In _[The Defining Decade](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-defining-decade)_, Meg Jay notes that sunk costs have an especially strong hold over people who’ve chosen to move in together before getting engaged, because it becomes harder to extricate themselves from things like shared bills or pets.)

### Lesson #12: Be Sensible, Not Logical

You’ve now learned why you need to expect your future self to change when creating a long-term financial strategy. In Chapter 11, Housel shares another key to creating a long-term financial strategy you can stick to through decades: **Develop a strategy that’s sensible, not logical**. Housel implies that most people mistakenly think they want a _logical_ financial strategy (one driven by mathematically sound strategies) because that will make them the most money. However, he argues, what people really want is a _sensible_ strategy, which prioritizes your peace of mind, and that following a sensible strategy will maximize your earnings in the long run.

(Shortform note: [The more complicated something is, the smarter it seems](https://fs.blog/complexity-bias/). So a sensible strategy, which prioritizes your peace of mind over complicated math, may seem too simple to work. But in a 2015 article, Housel argues that [you don’t need to understand the math behind why your strategy works—only its real-world consequences](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/06/the-power-of-common-sense.aspx).)

#### The Problems With a Logical Strategy

Housel argues that there are two major problems with purely logical strategies.

First, **purely logical strategies don’t try to prevent regret**, since they’re focused on making as much money as possible. However, most people also want to feel as little regret as possible. Regret might come from missing an opportunity, or it might come from how negatively you feel if people around you think you've invested poorly. Purely mathematically driven strategies might require you to pass on some investment opportunities, making you feel like other people are judging you for poor insights. In this way, strictly logical strategies sometimes don’t coordinate with our sometimes-illogical desires.

(Shortform note: The fact that purely logical strategies don’t try to prevent regret may have some benefits: One psychologist argues that [if you try too hard to prevent regret, you’ll grow too scared to take the risks you need to achieve your goals](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/curious/201008/5-key-things-weve-learned-about-regret).)

Second, **purely logical strategies often aren’t realistic.** As an example, Housel cites a study that recommended a retirement savings strategy in which you invest two dollars in the stock market for every one dollar you own (putting yourself into debt to do so), starting from a young age. The study showed that even if you lose your money in a market downturn, you’ll eventually regain your wealth in the long run if you simply continue to invest two dollars for every dollar you own. Housel agrees that this strategy is mathematically optimal but notes that it would never work in real life: If following a strategy lost someone all their money, no one would continue to follow it.

(Shortform note: If a strategy is obviously not realistic—like the one Housel cites—why would people follow it? In the blog post his book is based on, Housel argues that [we’re often overly impressed with the academic credentials of these studies’ authors](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/), so that we follow their advice blindly. Fancy degrees make people think you know what you’re doing. However, in finance, Housel argues, academic knowledge doesn’t guarantee financial success.)

### Why a Sensible Strategy Makes You More Money

Housel argues you’re better off following a sensible strategy, even if it doesn’t perfectly maximize your earnings, **because it can account for the non-financial elements you care about**—like your desire to prevent regret or the ease of following a strategy—and therefore, will ultimately make you more money.

Why, exactly, does this happen? As Housel repeatedly states, the longer you have money in the market, the more likely you are to increase it. Therefore, the best long-term financial strategy is to _pick a strategy and commit to it long-term_. Because you’re more likely to stray from a strictly logical strategy if it drives you to feel regret or if it’s unreasonably difficult to follow, a _sensible_ strategy—one that’s easier to stick to—will ultimately make you more money.

(Shortform note: One easy way to remain committed to a long-term strategy—that is also sensible because it’s easy to follow—is to follow Sethi’s advice in _[I Will Teach You To Be Rich](https://shortform.com/app/book/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich)_ and [automate your investments](https://shortform.com/app/book/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/chapter-5). Behavioral scientists argue that [automating your finances is the best approach because we tend to keep doing whatever we were doing](https://www.ted.com/talks/wendy_de_la_rosa_a_simple_2_step_plan_for_saving_more_money/)—so if you automate your investments, you’re less likely to change your strategy simply because it’s too much work and you can keep investing even if you do nothing.)

As an example, Housel notes that many people have a “home bias:” They only invest in their home country. Given how many countries there are, this is illogical. But if you feel more kinship with companies from your country, it’s sensible: Investing requires you to trust your money to strangers, so you should find the strangers you’re most comfortable with.

(Shortform note: Housel never points out that there are legitimate, logical reasons to invest in your home country over a foreign one—like the fact that most people will be more familiar with the laws, the market and the language of their own country than of others’.)

#### Invest Emotionally

How, exactly, do you create a sensible financial strategy?

One method Housel suggests is to **invest in companies you love**. This is illogical: Your personal feelings about a company have no bearing on their earning potential. However, when a company you love does poorly, you’ll be far less likely to abandon your investment because you genuinely care about the company, want to support it, and believe that it will ultimately be successful because you’re confident in its mission. By investing in companies you love, you’ll stay in the market longer, which will ultimately lead to more financial success.

(Shortform note: If you love the company you work for, you may want to invest in it. After all, you’re far less likely to abandon an investment if you not only love that company but you’re employed by that company, too. However, [other financial experts warn against this strategy because it doubles your financial risk](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/love-my-company-love-stock-beware-concentration-risk): If the company fails, you’ll lose money both because your investments will become worthless _and_ because you’ll be out of a job.)

### Lesson #13: Develop a Survival Mentality

In order to create a financial strategy you can stick to, you must plan how you’ll keep any wealth you accumulate. To do so, Housel argues in Chapter 5, you must **develop a survival mentality**.

Housel explains that when you have a survival mentality, you recognize that you could lose all your money and not be able to gain it back—and so you take measures to prevent that from happening: You are humble, frugal, and you avoid unwise risks. You focus not on building your wealth but on protecting it so that your assets can accumulate the maximum possible amount of compound interest.

(Shortform note: Housel’s recommendation to develop a survival mentality is somewhat similar to advice given in financial advice classic _[The Richest Man in Babylon](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-richest-man-in-babylon/)_, in which George Clason suggests that the [first thing you should do with the money you’ve saved is to protect it.](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-richest-man-in-babylon/1-page-summary) But unlike Housel, who discusses the importance of a survival mentality primarily when investing, Clason recommends several ways to protect your money that have nothing to do with investing—like not loaning your money to friends and family who won’t repay you.)

**#1: You prioritize stability over profit**.

Housel explains that when you have a survival mindset, you believe that long-term consistent gains from compounding will make you the most money in the long run. As such, you prioritize the measures that keep your returns the most stable over time instead of measures that might temporarily increase your earnings but ultimately destabilize your earnings and lose you money.

For example, you may be tempted to liquidate all your stocks and invest heavily in a burgeoning cryptocurrency market. But with a survival mindset, you’ll realize that given the volatility of cryptocurrency, you should leave at least some of your stocks in the stabler stock market so they can compound long-term.

(Shortform note: In _[Fooled by Randomness](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness)_, Taleb shares another reason to prioritize stability over profit: [Even if you do get lucky and win a windfall, you’ll probably lose it again](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness/part-1). He argues that both good and bad luck eventually run out, and outliers of either success or failure eventually earn outcomes more closely matching their skills—so [you should focus on succeeding via measures that are less prone to chance](https://shortform.com/app/book/fooled-by-randomness/1-page-summary).)

**#2: You prioritize room for error when creating plans.**

As we discussed earlier, the future is uncertain. So if your financial plan only works in a narrow range of possible futures, you’re placing yourself in a precarious position. When you have a survival mentality, Housel explains, you include lots of room for error in your financial plan. By doing so, you plan for a wide range of possibilities and increase the likelihood that you’ll become financially successful even if a lot of things don’t go your way.

(Shortform note: Housel shares several ways to build room for error into your financial plan in Lesson #10, but one area he doesn’t discuss is your career. In _[Range](https://shortform.com/app/book/range),_ Epstein recommends [becoming a generalist who has broad competence in many professional fields instead of a specialist who masters just one](https://shortform.com/app/book/range). Epstein argues that generalism helps you solve problems you’ve never seen before—so being a generalist will likely provide you with more career flexibility, which is a form of having room for error in your financial plan. With career flexibility, you can survive even if your industry becomes obsolete.)

**#3: You are realistically optimistic.**

Housel explains that with a survival mentality, you have faith that you’ll gain money in the long term, but you recognize the reality that you’ll face many financial challenges in the short term. In other words, realistic optimism requires simultaneous hope and paranoia.

Believing both that you’ll gain money long-term and lose short-term may seem initially unreasonable. However, Housel explains that many financial factors—like the economy, the stock market, and your career—often follow a trajectory of long-term growth but short-term loss. For example, Housel notes, the U.S. economy grew dramatically between 1850 and 2020, with the per capita G.D.P. increasing from less than $10 to nearly $100. However, the U.S. also spent 48 of those years in 33 recessions.

As such, Housel argues, feeling simultaneous hope and paranoia is reasonable, and the two emotions are complementary: Because you’re paranoid about your short-term financial losses, you’ll take the measures necessary to protect your money so that you can gain more of it in the long term.

(Shortform note: Psychologists support Housel’s argument that realistic optimism is key to success. They explain that [while the most successful people believe they’ll succeed, they also believe that this success will come with difficulty](https://hbr.org/2011/05/be-an-optimist-without-being-a)—so they plan for things to go wrong and stay in the game longer when things do. Therefore, psychologists recommend visualizing _what you’ll do_ in order to succeed—not the success itself. Try this yourself by reviewing the US’ economic history: If you faced similar situations, what would you want to do? Keep in mind what you learned in Lesson #3 about focusing on patterns to learn most effectively from economic history.)
