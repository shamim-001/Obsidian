## 1-Page Summary

If you want to know how to live your life, who better to ask than people who have lived life to its fullest? _[Tribe of Mentors](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/tribe-of-mentors-timothy-ferriss)_ is distilled life advice from more than 130 world-class experts in a wide variety of fields, including artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, and more.

Author Tim Ferriss got the idea to write _Tribe of Mentors_ around the time he turned 40. Facing a mild existential crisis, uncertain about how he wanted to live going forward, he decided to solicit advice from the wisest, most successful people he could think of. Ferriss sent the same list of 11 questions to these experts via email and Twitter, promising to put his favorite responses into a book.

This book is a spiritual successor to Ferriss’s book _[Tools of Titans](https://shortform.com/app/book/tools-of-titans/1-page-summary)_, another collection of distilled wisdom. Ferriss asserts that _Tribe of Mentors_ [covers a broader range of perspectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II4nyW6U0BE) than _Tools of Titans_.

In this guide, we’ve categorized the book’s advice into broad topics, emphasizing ideas repeated by multiple experts:

- How to Take Advice
- How to Spend Your Time Well
- How to Build a Fulfilling Career
- How to Fail Well
- How to Say No
- How to Recenter Yourself
- How to Be Kind to Yourself

In our commentary, we’ll supplement Ferriss’s advice with tips for success from other top-performing experts and authors, including Cal Newport, Ryan Holiday, and Laura Vanderkam.

### How to Take Advice

First, let’s discuss a topic that may influence how you read the rest of this guide: how to interpret and apply advice. We’ll begin by explaining why you shouldn’t completely trust any piece of advice, no matter who gives it to you. Then, we’ll detail an alternative: trusting your intuition more than the authority of others. Finally, we’ll explore a counterpoint some of Ferriss’s experts offer: Continually challenge your intuitive assumptions rather than trusting them implicitly.

#### Don’t Fully Trust Any Advice

Some of Ferriss’s experts argue against blindly accepting any advice because **no single piece of advice applies to everyone.** Writer and speaker Julia Galef asserts that the exact same advice may be helpful to one person and unproductive to another who’s in a different situation. Learn to critically judge the advice you receive, tailoring it to your unique circumstances or rejecting it if it doesn’t apply to your situation.

Similarly, philanthropist John Arnold recommends largely ignoring the advice of others. He says that nearly everyone who gives advice is drawing solely from anecdotal experience. Consequently, they make statements that seem objective but are actually unique to their circumstances. There’s no single path to greatness, no matter what anyone says. Two people using vastly different strategies can both find wild success. For instance, one author may write a bestseller by forcing themselves to sit and write down every idea they have. Another may write _their_ bestseller by taking frequent walks and only writing down ideas when they flow naturally.

> **Try the Opposite of Any Advice You Get**
> 
> Like Galef and Arnold, psychiatrist Scott Alexander says that no advice is universally useful. However, he presents a more radical solution than obeying or ignoring advice: [doing the exact opposite of that advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/).
> 
> His logic is that people tend to gather in, or seek out, communities that affirm their preexisting beliefs. The advice you seek or receive is therefore likely to support your existing perspective and behavior, which is a problem if adopting an alternative perspective or pursuing a different course of action would be more beneficial. Additionally, as Arnold notes, people assume that their advice-givers’ subjective, anecdotal advice is universal wisdom, which leaves them unaware of their bias. Therefore, doing the opposite of the advice you hear could allow you to circumvent your group bias and improve your life by adding balance.
> 
> For example, imagine someone who’s too frugal, pinching pennies at every opportunity and never spending outside of their budget. They’ll naturally read money-saving blogs and books on frugal living. They’d likely live a happier life if they worried about money less and spent generously on friends, but all the advice they seek out will be the opposite of what they need to hear. In contrast, an irresponsible spender will naturally seek advice from influencers selling lavish luxury items—but they’d likely live a better life if they took advice on saving for the future.
> 
> Alexander notes that this idea doesn’t apply to all advice—some advice is good in every situation, like “always bring a parachute when you go skydiving. ” However, the thought experiment may encourage you to consider valuable ideas you otherwise wouldn’t have. This is one way you can apply critical thinking to the advice you receive, as Galef recommends.

#### Trust Your Intuition

Rather than trusting the expertise of others, some of Ferriss’s experts suggest learning to take advice from yourself—trusting your intuition.

Hedge fund advisor and chess master Adam Robinson asserts that **the intuitive unconscious mind is significantly more powerful and insightful than the conscious mind.** Filmmaker and author Soman Chainani elaborates, arguing that many of your conscious thoughts that seem true are actually false ideas from your past that you haven’t challenged. In contrast, your unconscious mind communicates with intuitive feelings and images that are often more accurate indicators of the truth.

> **How the Unconscious Mind Works**
> 
> How could the unconscious mind be such a powerful source of valuable insights? Experts assert that the subconscious is insightful because [it can process a massive amount of information](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/unconscious). Conscious thought [requires a lot of intense brain activity,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia24vJNlK9c&t=7s) but by freeing itself from the constraint of awareness, your brain can process information much more quickly, recognize more patterns, and come to insightful conclusions about the world that lie outside of your conscious knowledge.
> 
> However, sometimes your intuitive mind comes to conclusions that contradict your conscious beliefs, as Chainani describes. One reason you may choose to cling to certain beliefs from your past despite subconsciously distrusting them is that you find it too painful to admit what you believe, so your unconscious mind hides these thoughts from your conscious mind. Unconsciously hiding your beliefs from yourself is what [Sigmund Freud called “repression,”](https://www.verywellmind.com/repression-as-a-defense-mechanism-4586642) and unraveling these repressed thoughts is one of [the chief goals of psychoanalytic therapy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/psychoanalytic-therapy-5221426#toc-what-is-psychoanalytic-theory).

##### Trust Your Intuition When Creating Art

Many of Ferriss’s experts assert that **trusting your intuition is particularly important when you’re creating art.** Actor and director Ben Stiller argues that a unique, authentic voice is what makes art compelling. In particular, he warns against overriding your intuition by modeling your art after what you assume a broad audience wants to see. Television showrunner Brian Koppelman agrees, adding that the only way you can fully dedicate your heart and soul to your work is to create what you intuitively feel drawn to create. He notes that this level of dedication is necessary for the highest creative success.

> **Be Unique, but Not Too Authentic**
> 
> In _[The Practice](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-practice)_, Seth Godin agrees that channeling your unique voice [makes your art more valuable](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-practice/1-page-summary#use-your-unique-voice). The alternative is copying existing things, but this is just a way of hiding the true, distinctive inner voice that will enhance your creative work.
> 
> However, Godin also argues that you shouldn’t concern yourself with being “authentic” when making art. Pure authenticity would be creating whatever feels right to you at the moment, but this wouldn’t necessarily be valuable. According to Godin, truly valuable art requires you to filter your authentic voice with an audience in mind, shaping your ideas into a form that [changes people for the better](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-practice/1-page-summary#principle-2-establish-your-intent). For instance, some critics contend that Stiller’s television series _Severance_ is helping its audience [confront their unhealthy relationship with work](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/severance-finale-job_l_624f0fdee4b09817450bd49b). Godin maintains that shaping your art into an impactful form is an inherently inauthentic process—it doesn’t come naturally.
> 
> Arguably, focusing on the impact your art has on others will also get you more excited and dedicated to the work than following Koppleman’s advice of creating whatever your heart wants to create. For many, improving the lives of others [is a more powerful motivating purpose than personal gratification](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit/part-2-3)—which may hold true even if that gratification is a form of artistic expression.

#### Counterpoint: Question Your Assumptions

Although some of Ferriss’s experts advocate listening to your intuition, this advice may lead you astray if you implicitly trust that everything your gut tells you is true. Some of Ferriss’s other experts warn against this kind of unconditional confidence in your own beliefs, advising you to **challenge every thought and feeling you have**.

Martial artist and chess master Josh Waitzkin (_[The Art of Learning](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-learning)_) advises regularly questioning everything you believe—and what those around you believe. If you don’t, you’ll default to instinctively trying to keep your worldview and beliefs static, which may cause you to suffer and prevent you from making forward progress in life.

Author and poker expert Annie Duke (_[Thinking in Bets](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-bets)_) agrees, recommending that you **actively search for people who disagree with you** and hear them out. Set a goal to prove yourself wrong about something every day. She asserts that generally, the truth of any situation lies between two extreme opinions, and by considering both sides, you can gain a more accurate understanding of the world.

> **Unlinking Identity From Beliefs**
> 
> According to Adam Grant in _[Think Again](https://shortform.com/app/book/think-again)_, the reason people try to keep their beliefs the same—even if it causes them to suffer, as Waitzkin says—is because [their identity is tied to their beliefs](https://shortform.com/app/book/think-again/1-page-summary#why-reconsideration-doesnt-happen). As a result, any challenge to their beliefs feels like a threat to who they are.
> 
> Grant gives advice on [how to unlink your identity from your beliefs](https://shortform.com/app/book/think-again#bridge-the-gap-between-assumption-and-reconsideration) and more readily change your mind. First, reflect on the times you’ve changed your mind in the past and were glad you did so. This will help you acknowledge that your beliefs naturally change over time—and that’s a good thing.
> 
> Second, intentionally tie your identity to _morals and values_ in place of beliefs. By defining yourself using values that you can express through a wide range of actions and beliefs, you can change your mind while keeping your sense of self intact. As an example, Ferriss’s experts appear to have built robust identities tied to the value of _mental flexibility_—they celebrate being the kind of people who challenge their beliefs daily.
> 
> That said, challenging all your beliefs doesn’t mean you always have to change your mind. If you already believe something that _is_ true, changing your mind would be a mistake. As a counterpoint to Duke, the truth of a given situation isn’t always between two extremes. Universally believing this would be falling prey to [the logical fallacy of “argument to moderation”](http://logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Argument-to-Moderation)—the assumption that if a statement takes the middle position between two conflicting ideas, it must be true.

### How to Spend Your Time Well

Now that we’ve discussed how to interpret and apply advice, let’s examine some of Ferriss’s experts’ advice on the broad topic of purpose: What should you do with your life? More specifically, how should you spend your time?

To answer these questions, we’ll first explain why it’s necessary to identify what matters most to you and prioritize meaningful causes over other ways you could use your time. Then, we’ll discuss why it’s best to work as hard as you can in pursuit of these meaningful goals (while resting enough to do so effectively).

#### Identify What’s Most Important to You

Many of Ferriss’s experts argue that assessing what you truly care about is the key to spending your time in a fulfilling way. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks asserts that **once you dedicate yourself to a noble life purpose that’s greater than yourself, you’ll feel fulfilled** no matter what painful obstacles are in your way.

(Shortform note: Mark Manson’s book _[Everything Is F*cked](https://shortform.com/app/book/everything-is-f-cked)_ explores how having a meaningful, future-oriented purpose gives humans the hope they need to endure painful situations. To build this kind of comforting hope, he recommends focusing on [changing your beliefs about yourself](https://shortform.com/app/book/everything-is-f-cked#how-to-find-hope). The unhappiest people are those who believe they’re uniquely defective and aren’t capable of accomplishing a life purpose. However, Manson argues that everyone is capable of doing something to make the future brighter. By reflecting on your past and positively reinterpreting your life story, you can forge new empowering beliefs that give you the hope you need to do something meaningful.)

How do you identify what’s most important to you? Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann recommends journaling to clarify your values. Take a break from your urgent daily tasks to reflect on what matters—write down what's most important for you to do in the next few days, the next few months, and especially in the next several years. People feel lost and confused when they lose sight of their long-term intentions.

(Shortform note: In _[The Miracle Morning](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-miracle-morning)_, Hal Elrod also recommends journaling to make sure you’re heading in a meaningful direction. To get the most out of your journaling, he recommends [using it in conjunction with affirmation and visualization](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-miracle-morning#your-miracle-morning). Don’t just clarify what would be meaningful for you to do—[state out loud](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-miracle-morning/chapter-6) what you want, what you’ll do to get it, and why. This helps override negative thought patterns so your unconscious mind moves you toward your goals rather than away from them. Then, [imagine—in as much sensory detail as possible](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-miracle-morning/chapter-7)—what it’ll feel like to achieve your meaningful goal and reap the benefits of your dream life. This will help your ideal future feel more real and get you excited to take action.)

On the other hand, author Steven Pressfield (_[The War of Art](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-war-of-art)_) contends that discovering what’s most important to you isn’t this simple. He frames the search for personal values as an ongoing struggle, arguing that you can only learn who you are and what you care about naturally through life experience—in particular, through experimentation and failure.

(Shortform note: Even if it’s possible to immediately articulate and commit to a life purpose, you may benefit from waiting and experimenting in the real world. In _[Range](https://shortform.com/app/book/range)_, David Epstein argues that a broad range of life experience gives you [unique, transferable skills](https://shortform.com/app/book/range/part-2-1#benefit-1-a-broad-range-of-experience) that help you find success in whatever life purpose you end up committing to. For instance, if you start your own business but find yourself unfulfilled later in life, you can apply the same tenacity and problem-solving skills to a career in medicine. Additionally, trying out different pursuits makes it [more likely you’ll end up in one you find fulfilling](https://shortform.com/app/book/range/part-2-1#benefit-2-youll-discover-a-good-fit)—the only way to know for sure whether a pursuit is a good fit for you is to try it out.)

#### Actively Prioritize What’s Important

After you’ve identified what’s most important to you, you can find fulfillment by spending time on that meaningful purpose. However, historian Sarah Elizabeth Lewis asserts that life is full of distractions keeping you from pursuing what matters most to you. To overcome this, Lewis recommends blocking out time every day to make progress on your most important goal. Dropbox founder Drew Houston agrees, offering the more extreme recommendation to track your time in detail and reflect objectively on how you spend each hour of the day. Then, proactively build large blocks of time into your schedule to accomplish important tasks.

(Shortform note: In _[168 Hours](https://shortform.com/app/book/168-hours/1-page-summary)_, Laura Vanderkam [concurs with Houston’s idea to track how you spend every hour of every day](https://shortform.com/app/book/168-hours/1-page-summary#how-to-be-intentional-with-your-time). However, rather than deeply reflecting on how you spend every hour—or even every _day_, as Lewis recommends—she suggests reflecting on how you spend each 168-hour block of your time. Add up how many hours you spent on sleep, work, family time, social media, your goals, and so on during a 168-hour period. Then, reflect on whether or not you’re satisfied with the time split between these activities. If you’re not spending enough time on your meaningful purpose, see if there’s a category in which you can cut down time—like social media, for instance.)

Financial blogger Pete Adeney argues that the biggest prioritization mistake people make is sacrificing their time and energy to earn money for things they don’t truly want or need. Adeney retired at age 30 with enough money to support himself and his family for the rest of his life on a frugal but comfortable budget. Accomplishing this involved rejecting anything that he didn’t value and saving up for what he really wanted: freedom from the obligation to work.

(Shortform note: How can you save enough money to retire at age 30? On his blog devoted to convincing the world that this frugal lifestyle is possible and satisfying, Adeney [outlines several suggestions](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/): Live close to work to reduce the cost of gas and car maintenance, only purchase cost-effective groceries, seek cheap and free sources of entertainment, and most importantly, invest all the money you can afford to.)

#### Work Hard to Achieve Important Goals

Many of Ferriss’s experts advocate working as hard as you can to accomplish the important goals you’ve identified and prioritized. Weightlifting champion Jerzy Gregorek argues that **everything that makes a meaningful impact on the world is the result of countless years of hard work.** Thus, working hard is the ultimate act of love and selflessness you can give. Whenever you face a challenging decision, ask yourself which choice involves more hardship—it’s usually the right one.

> **Get More Done by Working Less**
> 
> Tim Ferriss himself offers somewhat of a counterargument to this idea in his first book, _[The 4-Hour Workweek](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-4-hour-workweek)_. By streamlining your schedule and using your time more strategically, it’s often possible to achieve the same meaningful impact on the world (or more) while putting in significantly less work.
> 
> Ferriss cites [the 80/20 Rule](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-4-hour-workweek/part-2#pareto-and-the-80-20-rule), which states that often, 20% of your efforts cause 80% of your results. By studying which of your efforts generate the most results and devoting more time to those tasks, you can vastly increase your impact without working any harder. For example, when he was selling brain supplements, Ferriss found that by dropping unprofitable clients and seeking out more clients like his best ones, his profits rose even if he worked fewer hours. This helped him serve his best clients even better and earned him more time and money to [invest in causes meaningful to him](https://saiseifoundation.org/).

##### Hard Work Is Rewarding

Additionally, some of Ferriss’s experts contend that hard work is its own reward. Champion wrestler and quadruple amputee Kyle Maynard asserts that **painful struggle is the source of his greatest joys.** He states that he gets much more fulfillment from fighting against impossible odds than he would from settling into a safe, comfortable life.

(Shortform note: Pursuing hard work won’t necessarily make you feel joyful right away. Some research has found that painful hard work [sometimes lowers happiness while you’re in the midst of it](https://elemental.medium.com/hard-work-is-the-key-to-true-happiness-aka-your-parents-were-right-cfeb20bbe02a#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9Cupon%20reflection%E2%80%9D%20component%20is%20important.), but reflecting on memories of hard work creates strong feelings of satisfaction. Conversely, the tendency to avoid effortful tasks is significantly correlated with depression.)

##### Counterpoint: Productivity Requires Rest

Some of Ferriss’s experts offer a caveat to the advice to work hard: Don’t push yourself past your limits. Ultra-marathoner Amelia Boone contends that rest is a necessary part of life, and skipping it only hampers your health and performance. _Huffington Post_ founder Arianna Huffington agrees, adding that if you need more rest, it may help to tell yourself that **time spent taking care of yourself is _work_**, since you need it to fuel your productivity.

(Shortform note: If you see taking care of yourself as “work,” as Huffington suggests, you may want to know: What’s the most efficient way to do this “work”? In other words, if you want to enhance your performance, avoid pushing yourself too far, and preserve your health, what’s the most efficient way to rest your brain? In _[Hyperfocus](https://shortform.com/app/book/hyperfocus)_, Chris Bailey recommends [intentionally mind-wandering](https://shortform.com/app/book/hyperfocus/chapter-7#why-how-and-when-to-intentionally-mind-wander-for-better-rest): Engage in a fun activity that’s easy to do without thinking, so you can take a break from forcing yourself to focus. Second, make sure to [get enough quality sleep](https://shortform.com/app/book/hyperfocus/chapter-7#why-and-how-to-sleep-better). A good night’s sleep can increase your working memory capacity by almost 60%, allowing you to be vastly more productive than if you tried to work while sleep deprived.)

### How to Build a Fulfilling Career

Now that we’ve covered why it’s important to spend as much time as possible on the goals you care about most, let’s apply these ideas to professional work—how do you build a career that you’re happy to spend time on?

In this section, we’ll discuss whether or not passion for the work should be your highest priority when searching for a job. Then, we’ll explore how some experts advise rejecting the traditional path to success and embracing a more risky lifestyle.

#### Follow Your Passion

Many of Ferriss’s experts agree that **a job you’re excited about is the core of a fulfilling life**. Political commentator Tommy Vietor argues that true passion should be your number one priority when looking for a career. Record producer Rick Rubin notes that if you follow your passion, you won’t care whether you find success or not since you’ll be doing something you love.

Design expert Debbie Millman takes this idea further, arguing that if you’re truly pursuing your passion, you’ll have no reason to worry about maintaining a work-life balance. The work itself will feel like all you need in life. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman voices a similar opinion, stating that work is there to center his life and make him feel content when nothing else will.

(Shortform note: You may not want to center your entire life and happiness around a career you’re passionate about, as Ferriss’s experts recommend. Some experts argue that if you define yourself entirely by your work, [you’ll suffer an identity crisis](https://hbr.org/2022/10/striking-a-balance-between-your-passion-and-your-paycheck) if you’re laid off or your job is otherwise disrupted. If you can’t feel good about who you are outside of work, losing the chance to work will make you panic. Therefore, make your hobbies and other non-work activities as central to your life as your work so you can cope if something goes wrong professionally.)

> **Counterpoint: Being Passionate About Your Line of Work Doesn’t Matter**
> 
> Many of Ferriss’s experts agree that the key to a satisfying career is imagining a job you’d love to do, then going out and getting that job. In _[So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://shortform.com/app/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you),_ Cal Newport challenges that assumption, noting that some people in their self-proclaimed “dream job” still find they [dislike many of the tasks they have to do](https://shortform.com/app/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/chapters-1-3#piece-of-evidence-2-conference-board-surveys).
> 
> Newport argues that job satisfaction has nothing to do with working in a field you’re passionate about. Instead, people are happy and motivated to go to work when [they have autonomy on the job, feel like they’re good at their job, and feel emotionally connected](https://shortform.com/app/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/chapters-1-3#piece-of-evidence-1-scientific-research) to the people they work with.

##### Counterpoint: Work for Self-Development Before Pursuing Passion

Other experts caution against following your passion, at least at the beginning of your career. Instead, **they recommend taking whatever opportunities offer you the most valuable skills and learning experiences.** _Wired_ founder Kevin Kelly argues that if you focus on improving your skills, you’ll become valuable enough to pick and choose the opportunities that interest you the most, which lets you live whatever fulfilling life you want. BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen notes that his choice to wait to follow his passion—instead building up skills while working for others—is what made his first venture successful.

(Shortform note: Here, Ferriss’s experts frame skill acquisition as an early stage in your career that lets you claim (or, in Cohen’s case, create) the opportunities you want later. However, the authors of _[The Startup of You](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-startup-of-you)_ note that in today’s world, you should [never move out of the skill acquisition stage of your career](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-startup-of-you#the-shift-toward-careers-as-startups-and-the-startup-mindset). Rapidly advancing technology and globalization have [eliminated the valuable careers](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-startup-of-you#technology-globalization-and-the-end-of-traditional-career-development) you could retain over decades with the same set of skills—now, you must continuously acquire new skills to reliably create value in the rapidly-changing world.)

#### Don’t Follow the Traditional Path to Success

Many people follow the traditional path to success—slowly ascending from one secure job to a slightly better-paying one. However, some of Ferriss’s experts note that **constricting yourself to this path may keep you from building a career you’re passionate about.**

Actress Richa Chadha notes that the education system typically sets everyone up to follow the same path to success, but this comfortable, low-risk life can be a trap for people with bigger ambitions. If you want to leave a field you’re not excited about, throw yourself into a new pursuit completely; otherwise, it’ll be too tempting to go back to that comfortable life.

(Shortform note: Some research supports Chadha’s assertion that the temptation to fall back to a safer life path can harm your chances of career success. Specifically, the act of formulating a backup plan makes you less motivated to succeed with the initial plan. In one study, researchers [offered participants rewards for solving word puzzles](https://www.behance.net/blog/the-danger-of-making-a-backup-plan), including money and food. However, when they asked participants to come up with backup plans to earn those same rewards on their own, those participants were less motivated to complete the puzzles and performed poorly.)

Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt describes one way to commit to an untraditional life path: **Get used to poor, cheap living conditions** so you don’t have anything to lose and the risks necessary for an untraditional career don’t scare you away. Entrepreneur Jérôme Jarre took this idea to the extreme, secretly living out of an office building in New York City for several months until his startup began earning profits.

(Shortform note: Arguably, it’s easier to commit to risky life decisions if you’re poor, desperate, and don’t have much to lose—like Jarre was when he lived out of an office building. But what if you’ve already established a comfortable life for yourself and therefore _do_ have something to lose? In this case, you can overcome the fear of total financial failure by [temporarily “practicing poverty.”](https://dailystoic.com/todays-stoic-practice-practice-misfortune/) The ancient Greek philosopher Seneca conquered such fears by intentionally setting aside days to practice living below his means, eating less, wearing ragged clothes, and sleeping in a less comfortable home.)

Cryptocurrency pioneer Nick Szabo also advocates for non-traditional career paths, noting that you shouldn’t feel the need to jump constantly from job to job. Unemployment can give you the space and freedom to devote your full attention to the creative ideas that seem the most promising to you.

(Shortform note: Employers may ask you to explain gaps in your résumé in future job interviews. Be prepared to [talk about your time off,](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-explain-employment-gaps) offering employers an honest explanation of why you were unemployed and any relevant experience you picked up in that time. Alternatively, if you only took a few months off between jobs, you may be able to [subtly hide the gaps in your employment history](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/employment-gaps-on-resume) on your résumé by listing the years you worked at each job instead of specifying which months you were hired.)

### How to Fail Well

If you choose to pursue work you’re passionate about, you’re likely to experience some failure along the way. What’s the best way to handle these failures? Ferriss’s experts explain that to push through failure, you just need to focus on the following upsides:

- Upside #1: Failure Teaches You
- Upside #2: Failure Pushes You to Get Creative
- Upside #3: Failure Gives You Freedom

Let’s discuss each of these upsides in more detail.

#### Upside #1: Failure Teaches You

Physician Gabor Maté (_[When the Body Says No](https://shortform.com/app/book/when-the-body-says-no)_) asserts that **failure shows you how to improve yourself**. Being fired from his job as a medical coordinator helped him discover that he was far more self-absorbed and less personable than he had realized. This prompted him to improve himself and find success in his next job. Similarly, CrossFit athlete Mathew Fraser lost a championship that he was certain he would dominate, which taught him he was prideful and complacent. This motivated him to work harder, allowing him to win the championship the next year.

(Shortform note: In _[Ego Is the Enemy](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy)_, Ryan Holiday describes a common trap that prevents people from learning how to improve themselves. If the outcome of their effort is positive overall, people [often overlook the mistakes they made along the way](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-3#examine-your-mistakes)—little failures that didn’t cause severe consequences initially, but could easily sabotage future efforts if repeated. To prevent this, Holiday recommends looking for room for improvement in your victories as much as your failures. If Maté had been looking for ways to do his job better before being fired, or if Fraser had sought ways to improve during his successful training before the championship, they could have averted their failures.)

#### Upside #2: Failure Pushes You to Get Creative

Some of Ferriss’s experts assert that **failure is valuable because it forces you to respond in creative ways**. These creative solutions often yield unique results since other people likely haven’t tried them before. Bodybuilder and acrobat Jon Call recounts how a severe ankle sprain caused him to train in ways that didn’t rely on his legs—specifically, using gymnastic rings. This gave him unique experience and pushed his skills in new directions he otherwise wouldn’t have chosen.

Similarly, burlesque performer and entrepreneur Dita Von Teese describes how her failure to become a ballerina forced her to forge an alternate path to the lifestyle she wanted. She had to think of a way into the elegant side of show business that didn’t require memorizing and executing intricate choreography—a limitation that inspired her to start performing burlesque. Von Teese contends that this adaptation made her unique and allowed her to have a greater impact on the world.

(Shortform note: Although failure can put you on a unique path to success, some say that you don’t _need_ to be one-of-a-kind to be a success. In _[Girl, Stop Apologizing](https://shortform.com/app/book/girl-stop-apologizing),_ Rachel Hollis argues that treading a similar path to people who came before you [is a respectable way to impact the world, too.](https://shortform.com/app/book/girl-stop-apologizing/part-1-2#the-truth-the-world-still-needs-you) Even if you’re the second—or five hundredth—person to accomplish something, you’re doing something good for the world that otherwise wouldn’t have happened. If Call was a less acrobatic bodybuilder and Von Teese only danced in the backgrounds of ballets, they still would have made a difference in the world. Instead of using the success of others as an excuse not to try, use their success as a roadmap to guide yourself.)

#### Upside #3: Failure Gives You Freedom

Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt argues that **devastating failure is valuable because it gives you freedom from fear.** After you fail, time passes and you realize that almost no failure has major permanent consequences. This reveals that there’s nothing to be afraid of, giving you the courage to risk failure again and improve your skills.

(Shortform note: In _[The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-4-hour-workweek)_, Tim Ferriss argues that by rationally considering beforehand how specific failures won’t have permanent consequences, you can reduce your fear of failure and gain the courage to act without needing to experience that failure firsthand. To this end, he recommends [an exercise he calls “fear-setting”](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-4-hour-workweek/chapter-3#fear-setting): Identify the worst-case scenario of a failure, make a plan for how you would fix it, and estimate how likely a negative outcome would be. After reflecting, you’ll often find that the worst-case scenario you’re afraid of is easily fixable and is less likely to come to pass than you think.)

Additionally, filmmaker David Lynch contends that **failure gives you freedom from all creative constraints.** After a massive failure, you have nothing more to lose, allowing you to create whatever your heart desires. This creative freedom is a source of pure joy.

(Shortform note: On the other hand, some experts argue that creating art without any constraints is undesirable. When you’re allowed to create _anything_, you often [lack the inspiration to make anything at all](https://musicbed.com/blog/filmmaking/writing/exploring-the-power-of-creative-constraints), as you have too many options to pick from and become paralyzed by this overwhelming choice. In contrast, trying to create something that fits within certain parameters—for instance, a filmmaker trying to convey deep philosophical thoughts in a form that’s appealing to mass audiences—can be a fun challenge. You may find it even more enjoyable than exercising total creative freedom.)

### How to Say No

As you build a fulfilling career, learn from failure, and attain valuable skills, people will likely begin to put more demands on your time. Many of Ferriss’s experts agree that **if you want to devote your life to the priorities you care about the most, you have to aggressively defend your time against these requests.**

Actress Aisha Tyler acknowledges that it’s difficult to deny people asking you for help; however, every distraction you allow into your life takes you further from your meaningful goals. Chef Samin Nosrat agrees, adding that the clearer your personal goals are in your mind, the easier you’ll find it to deny people making requests.

> **Overly Strict Boundaries Push People Away**
> 
> In _[Set Boundaries, Find Peace](https://shortform.com/app/book/set-boundaries-find-peace/1-page-summary)**,**_ Nedra Glover Tawwab agrees with Tyler that [it’s difficult to set boundaries](https://shortform.com/app/book/set-boundaries-find-peace/1-page-summary#step-2-communicate-your-boundaries). She adds that when you’re denying requests on your time, you should [avoid setting boundaries that are too strict](https://shortform.com/app/book/set-boundaries-find-peace/1-page-summary#strict-boundaries). People who’ve frequently been taken advantage of often overcompensate by refusing to forgive small impositions or by cutting good people out of their lives. This can disconnect you from loved ones as they come to believe you don’t care about them. For instance, if an aspiring lawyer studying for the bar exam has overly strict boundaries and their significant other asks them to cuddle and watch a movie during their designated study time, they may angrily refuse, creating an emotional rift.
> 
> How can you avoid this mistake? Tyler and Nosrat suggest focusing on the personal goals you want to accomplish to help you deny the requests of others, but you can use this same strategy to motivate yourself to set more lenient boundaries. If you clarify that maintaining relationships is one of your important personal goals, you’ll be willing to spend some time away from other personal goals without feeling like you’re compromising your needs.

##### Counterpoint: Say Yes to Random Opportunities

While entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk (_[Crush It!](https://shortform.com/app/book/crush-it/1-page-summary)_) acknowledges the importance of saying no to the majority of demands on your time, he also recommends **accepting a small number of random opportunities that cross your path**, even if they don’t seem remarkable or perfectly align with your personal goals. This measured chaos in your schedule keeps you open to unexpectedly valuable unplanned experiences.

> **Act Randomly to Get Unstuck**
> 
> In _[Algorithms to Live By](https://shortform.com/app/book/algorithms-to-live-by)_, Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths further explain why some randomness is [necessary to discover the best opportunities in life](https://shortform.com/app/book/algorithms-to-live-by/chapter-9#additional-background-the-hill-climbing-algorithm). Generally, you’ll choose the most promising opportunity that’s available to you at a given time. However, this can cause you to get stuck with an opportunity that’s better than any other opportunities you can see, but far worse than the available options you _can’t_ see. Breaking up your routine and doing something random may be unpleasant at first, but it might help you find new opportunities that you couldn’t see before.
> 
> For example, you might feel stuck at an unfulfilling job. You feel like you would be even _more_ miserable if you had to hunt for a new job or move to a new city, so you do nothing and stay put. One weekend, you decide to randomly attend the first open community event you see on Facebook—a group litter cleanup at the local park. Eventually, one of the people you met at this event offers you a job running events at the local community center, which you find much more fulfilling than your old job.

### How to Recenter Yourself

Sometimes, even after you’ve identified what matters most to you and are happily pursuing it, you’ll feel too tired or scattered to focus and do the work. Ferriss’s experts offer a few options for putting yourself back into a positive, productive mindset:

- Option #1: Take a Break
- Option #2: Engage the Body
- Option #3: Meditate
- Option #4: Shift Your Perspective

#### Option #1: Take a Break

Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky contends that **you should never feel guilty about taking a break from work when you need it.** When you’re having an off day and feel stuck, just go do something else—anything that allows your mind to wander and rest. Even if you’re not thinking about the problem, you’ll be unconsciously working through it in the back of your mind.

(Shortform note: Even if your unconscious mind works on problems while you’re taking a break, you may not want to spend all your breaks away from work idly daydreaming. Consider practicing [what Cal Newport calls “productive meditation”](https://shortform.com/app/book/deep-work/chapter-6#3-practice-productive-meditation) in _[Deep Work](https://shortform.com/app/book/deep-work)_: When doing a mindless physical task such as mowing the lawn or vacuuming the floor, continually refocus your mind on a single problem you’re trying to solve. He asserts that doing this regularly will strengthen your ability to focus. That said, Newport emphasizes that this [isn’t a replacement for your time spent away from work](https://youtu.be/ahTginruoBk?t=129), as your unconscious mind does solve problems when wandering—it’s just a way to increase your productivity in a life that already includes a healthy amount of rest.)

Similarly to Aronofsky, author and former skier Kristen Ulmer argues that when your body and mind start to resist the work, the best course of action is to stop working and listen to them. Do nothing but live in the moment, allowing yourself to get distracted and paying attention to how it feels. After living mindfully for long enough, your motivation to tackle the work will return—whether it takes a few minutes or a few days.

(Shortform note: In _[The Willpower Instinct](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct)_, Kelly McGonigal agrees that it’s helpful to accept the impulse to take a break, elaborating that trying to resist cravings and distractions [only makes them grow stronger](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct/chapters-9-10#thought-suppression-leads-to-willpower-failure). However, surrendering to them allows your brain to express its desires rather than resisting them, [which weakens the strength of the craving](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-willpower-instinct/chapters-9-10#willpower-hack-let-your-thoughts-and-cravings-come-and-go). This makes it easier for you to eventually move past the craving and accomplish your goals rather than letting a strong craving perpetually distract you while you’re trying to work.)

#### Option #2: Engage Your Body

Many of Ferriss’s experts note that **any activity that gets you out of your mind and into your body is an effective way to recenter yourself.** Entrepreneur and author Marie Forleo (_[Everything Is Figureoutable](https://shortform.com/app/book/everything-is-figureoutable)_) states that strenuous physical exercise allows you to thoroughly clear your mind and access a deep, unconscious intelligence in the body that helps you solve problems. Martial artist and chess master Josh Waitzkin (_[The Art of Learning](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-learning)_) also advocates exercise as a mental tool, contending that engaging the body fundamentally changes how your mind runs.

(Shortform note: In _[The Extended Mind](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-extended-mind)_, Annie Murphy Paul elaborates on this idea, arguing that different types of exercise [enhance your thinking in different ways](https://shortform.com/app/book/deep-work/chapter-6#3-practice-productive-meditation). Mild exercise such as standing or fidgeting while working improves your focus and quality of thought because forcing yourself to sit still takes up mental energy. Moderate exercise such as a brisk walk provides a stronger version of the same mental boost that lasts for up to two hours after you stop exercising. Heavy exercise sustained for 40 minutes or more has a very different effect—it clears your mind in a way that makes it harder to think logically, but easier to make creative connections and come up with new ideas.)

#### Option #3: Meditate

Many of Ferriss’s experts advocate for **routine meditation as a productivity tool.** Musician Mike D (of the Beastie Boys) finds that a short meditation session gives him renewed focus for hours. Similarly, DJ Steve Aoki uses meditation to clear his mind and prepare to enter the _flow state_ at work: an egoless, focused, creative state of mind conducive to maximum productivity.

(Shortform note: Although many artists practice meditation for increased focus, productivity, and clarity, some stay away, claiming that they need to be in touch with their suffering to create good art. They assume that if meditation makes them feel at peace, it’ll take away their creative spark. Dan Harris argues in _[10% Happier](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier)_ that [this isn’t the case](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier/part-4#mindfulness-wont-make-you-less-creative)—on the contrary, meditation allows you to explore your negative emotions in a deeper and more complex way, unlocking new insights that you can communicate through your art.)

#### Option #4: Shift Your Perspective

If you’re in an unproductive emotional state, **some of Ferriss’s experts recommend using thought experiments to get yourself thinking in new terms.**

##### Thought Experiment #1: Detaching From a Situation

To let go of a painful emotion caused by an upsetting situation, actress Richa Chadha recommends repeatedly asking yourself “So what?” in response to what happened, and to continue asking “So what?” until you’ve gained enough of a distant, big-picture perspective to no longer feel so upset. For example, if a coworker takes credit for your project at work, you might ask “So what?” and respond that “Our boss is going to think better of them than they deserve.” Ask again: So what? “They might get a bigger bonus than me.” So what? “I guess money isn’t very important.” Eventually, you reach a view of the situation that seems less threatening.

> **When Not to Ask “So What?”**
> 
> Although Chadha’s exercise is likely to be helpful for everyday upsetting situations, it may be unhealthy to try to apply it to a major tragedy in your life. In _[Bittersweet](https://shortform.com/app/book/bittersweet)_, Susan Cain argues that people in modern Western culture [tend to hide and suppress feelings of loss and grief](https://shortform.com/app/book/bittersweet#how-to-bear-grief-and-loss), making it more difficult for us to comfort one another and cope with tragedy. Trying to apply a big-picture, dispassionate perspective to tragedy may exacerbate these problems. For instance, asking yourself “So what?” after a good friend dies may be a means of suppressing your grief, preventing you from accepting the pain and working through it.
> 
> Instead, Cain recommends embracing whatever messy, complex mix of feelings you have, not only recognizing the heartbreak but also the joy and love you still feel toward whoever or whatever you lost.

##### Thought Experiment #2: Creating Gratitude

To cultivate gratitude and motivate yourself to live in the present moment, computer scientist Muneeb Ali suggests a thought experiment: Imagine the future in which you’re old, nearing death. Ask yourself how much you’d be willing to spend on a time machine that lets you relive _this moment_. This ideally will help you slow down and enjoy the priceless moments that you’d otherwise ruin by worrying about the past or future.

(Shortform note: Ali’s time machine scenario assumes that there’s something positive going on in your life that you’d be willing to pay to experience. But how do you practice gratitude at times [when everything in life seems miserable](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/practice-gratitude-everything-sucks_l_5fb806f9c5b680f7c38b7f64)? Start small; intentionally recognizing every little joy or pleasure in your life will help you feel better. You may want to try visually representing everything you have to be grateful for—for instance, whenever you feel grateful for something, add it to a list or write it down and put it in a jar you can fill up over time. These practices will help you build your gratitude muscle, making it easier to use Ali’s thought experiment and recognize exceptionally great moments when they happen.)

### How to Be Kind to Yourself

While you may feel pressured to follow all this advice to the letter, many of Ferriss’s experts acknowledge that this is an extremely difficult task. **Be kind to yourself and don’t feel the need to try too hard,** these experts advise**.**

Activist and businesswoman Muna AbuSulayman asserts that it’s easy to feel like you have to be perfect and achieve wild success in every area of your life every day. However, this unrealistic expectation will cause you to suffer. Instead, try your best, then quit worrying. This peaceful acceptance of any outcome helps you enjoy life and ensures that instead of getting discouraged and quitting if things don’t go to plan, you’ll be happy to try your best again next time.

(Shortform note: You may worry that practicing self-acceptance by embracing your imperfections and taking it easy will prevent you from pushing yourself to your full potential. Not necessarily: In _[The Happiness Advantage](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage)_, Shawn Achor argues that self-acceptance makes you feel happier, and happier people are more productive and therefore enjoy greater professional success. One reason for this is that the neurochemicals your brain releases when you’re happy also make it easier for you to [think quickly and creatively, solve problems, and learn new ideas](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage/principle-1#mental-and-emotional-benefits-of-happiness).)

Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez argues that it’s possible to maintain a playful mindset even in the most stressful situations. When Rodriguez faces tasks that seem impossible to accomplish with the time and resources he has, he makes it a habit to loudly proclaim “Fácil!”—Spanish for “easy”—to everyone around him. This mantra is half-joking and half-serious. It helps Rodriguez and his collaborators maintain a sense of humor as they work and gives them the optimism they need to accomplish much more than they thought was possible.

(Shortform note: Even if you don’t _feel_ enthusiastic during stressful situations, repeatedly acting as if you _are_ may make it easier to turn stress into excitement in the future. According to a psychological theory called the Hebbian Principle, when two parts of the brain activate simultaneously, [they form a connection](https://cognitiontoday.com/the-scientific-truth-behind-fake-it-till-you-make-it/#The_Hebbian_Principle_What_fires_together_wires_together): In the future, when one activates, the other will, too. This means that if you make yourself feel excited whenever you’re in a high-pressure situation, similar situations later will automatically make you feel excited. _Acting_ enthusiastic activates the same parts of your brain as actually _feeling_ enthusiastic, so you can form these neural connections just by pretending.)
