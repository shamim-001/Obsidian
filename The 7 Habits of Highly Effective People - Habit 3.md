## Habit 3: Prioritize Important Over Urgent

**Habit Description:**

- Prioritize your time and actions in order to live by your guiding principles and achieve the high-level goals you’ve identified.

(Shortform note: While Covey’s advice is helpful for assessing and prioritizing tasks, it may help to complement his strategy with the more detailed, systematic approach described in _[Getting Things Done](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/1-page-summary)_, by management consultant David Allen, which we’ll discuss below.)

### Why It Matters

Covey explains that all tasks can be categorized based on their urgency and importance: An activity can be one (either urgent or important), both, or neither.

- Urgent matters are time-sensitive, and they tend to grab your attention (like a pinging email). They cause you to _react_.
- Important matters contribute toward your goals, values, and personal mission statement (like writing your personal manifesto). They require you to _take initiative_.

To get a greater understanding, let’s examine each of Covey’s categories of tasks, which he refers to as quadrants. (Spoiler alert: Habit 3 teaches you to spend most of your time on Category-2 tasks.)

**Category 1: Urgent and Important**

- Types of tasks: Crises and problems
- Spending time in Category 1 creates a vicious cycle—you spend all your time putting out fires, and you have none left to do the planning and preparation to avoid _future_ crises.
- Action: Do these tasks now, but try to keep them from happening in the future.

**Category 2: Not Urgent, but Important**

- Types of tasks: Activities that could easily be put off for their lack of apparent urgency, but which will greatly benefit your life in the long term if you invest the time in them (like exercising)
- **This is where effective people focus their time and energy**, but it takes discipline to prioritize these tasks.
- Action: Devote time to these tasks.

**Category 3: Urgent, but not Important**

- Types of tasks: Things that other people want you to do, but which don’t contribute to your goals and values (like busywork)
- These kinds of activities can eat up your precious time and energy, without giving much value back to your life. Some people don’t even realize that these matters are not important, assuming that urgency implies importance.
- Action: Delegate.

**Category 4: Neither Urgent nor Important**

- Types of tasks: Leisure and entertainment (like scrolling on social media).
- These activities contribute nothing to your life, and effective people tend to avoid them.
- Action: Stop doing these tasks.

Covey contends that effective people understand the value of proactively investing in Category-2 activities—and it’s easier to recognize what’s important (and what’s not) once you’ve defined your goals and principles, as you did in Habit 2.

> **Develop Time Management _Skills_ to Complement the _Tools_**
> 
> Although Covey doesn’t give attribution, this time management matrix was actually [created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/), who faced countless demands on his time in his roles as the president, an Army general, and a supreme commander for the Allied Forces and NATO. However, subsequent time management research suggests that the Eisenhower Matrix addresses no more than two of the three skills necessary for effective time management.
> 
> Tools like the matrix or the GTD (Getting Things Done) system won’t work if you don’t have the skills to use them—here are the [three skills you need for time management](https://hbr.org/2020/01/time-management-is-about-more-than-life-hacks):
> 
> - **Awareness** that your available time is limited (this skill is key to avoid procrastination)
>     
> - **Arrangement** of your time through goal-setting, planning, and scheduling
>     
> - **Adaptation** of your time while carrying out tasks, particularly when you’re interrupted or when you have to shift priorities (this skill is key to prioritizing effectively)
>     
> 
> The matrix helps you hone one or two of these skills, but not all three:
> 
> - Awareness—The matrix doesn’t factor in how long a task takes, gauge how accurately you estimate how long activities will take, or improve how you budget your limited time.
>     
> - Arrangement—The matrix is most effective in this category because it helps you prioritize what’s important so that you can arrange your tasks and obligations accordingly.
>     
> - Adaptation—The matrix potentially improves adaptation by providing a system to gauge and adjust priorities on the fly. For instance, if you’re in the middle of an important task when your coworker sends an urgent request, you can quickly use the matrix to categorize the new task and then decide how it stacks up against what you were already working on.
>     
> 
> While the matrix is a helpful tool, it isn’t enough alone to make substantial time management improvements: Research shows that **each of the three skills is equally important in effective time management.**
> 
> Below are some [evidence-based tips](https://hbr.org/2020/01/time-management-is-about-more-than-life-hacks) to improve your time management skills:
> 
> - **Awareness:**
>     
>     - Determine the time of day when you’re most productive. Divide the day into chunks and spend a week logging your most- and least-productive time slots.
>         
>     - Test your awareness skills: When you finish a task, compare how much time you budgeted and how much time you spent.
>         
>     - In _The Effective Executive_, Drucker recommends [logging everything you do and how long it takes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-1) for three to four weeks at a time, twice a year. Once you know definitively how you’re spending your time, you can create a plan to use it more effectively.
>         
> - **Arrangement:**
>     
>     - Schedule time for yourself. When you need to spend time on a task or project, put it in your calendar and treat it like any other appointment.
>         
>     - Ask someone else to check your budgeted time for certain projects to avoid underestimating how long something will take.
>         
> - **Adaptation:**
>     
>     - Tackle daunting tasks in short bursts of 15 to 30 minutes. This will give you momentum and prevent procrastination.
>         
>     - Establish distraction-free times; turn off phone and email alerts and stay off social media during these windows.
>         

### How To

Covey asserts that **weekly planning is the most effective way to manage your time and stay on the path toward realizing your personal manifesto.**

- In contrast to daily planning, weekly planning is broad enough that you can adjust your schedule when important things come up unexpectedly.
- In contrast to longer-term goals, weekly planning is narrow enough that you can ensure important tasks get done promptly.

(Shortform note: You’re also [less likely to become fixated on details and lose sight of your goals with weekly planning](https://allaboutplanners.com.au/daily-versus-weekly-planners-which-is-right-for-you/) than with daily planning. Further, you’re less likely to feel overwhelmed or paralyzed by the details,)

Follow these steps to create your weekly plan:

1. **Identify your roles** (such as spouse, manager, and volunteer). Focus only on roles that are relevant in the upcoming week.
2. **Identify one or two goals you want to achieve for each role** within the next week. These goals should contribute to your manifesto, and at least some of them should fall into Category 2.
3. **Assign a day to accomplish each goal.** Consider which goals are time-sensitive (for instance, a call you have to make during business hours), check your calendar for prior commitments, and assess whether those commitments can be rescheduled or canceled.
4. **Schedule time for activities that renew and revitalize you.** More on this in Habit 7.
5. **Build in open, unscheduled time** for the unexpected. This creates a higher quality of life that is key to sustaining this habit.
6. **As you go through the week, adapt as needed.** Begin each day by reviewing that day’s agenda and remembering why they’re important. When things come up unexpectedly, evaluate how they fit in with your goals and scheduled priorities.

Shifting your time and attention primarily to Category 2 (what Covey calls “Quadrant 2”) is a gradual process. Initially, you’ll only have time to spare from Categories 3 and 4. However, over time, the tasks you accomplish in Category 2 will prevent Category-1 issues.

> **Prioritize and Get Things Done**
> 
> Like much of Covey’s advice, Habit 3 takes a big-picture approach to scheduling your tasks and to-dos. But when it comes to the relentless flow of emails, favors, and other tasks that arise and often overwhelm us, his only guidance is to use the urgent-important matrix to prioritize and to build open time into your schedule for the unexpected.
> 
> This is where the Getting Things Done (GTD) system can help: This approach details how to gather, assess, organize, and address every to-do that you encounter. The five steps of the GTD system are:
> 
> - **[Capture](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-5)** all the problems and ideas that are taking your attention. Find every sticky note, email, and to-do and put it in a tray.
>     
> - **[Clarify](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-6)** what you need to do with each item: throw it away, keep it for reference, delegate it, do it, schedule it, or save it to reconsider later.
>     
> - **[Organize](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-7)** each item based on your evaluation from Step 2. Reference items and things to reconsider later should be filed away, delegated items should be handed off, action items go on a to-do list, and scheduled items go on a calendar.
>     
> - **[Review](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-8)** your calendar and to-do list frequently; your calendar determines the structure of your days and weeks, while your to-do list tells you what to tackle between scheduled appointments. Additionally, do a weekly review to review your files and to capture, clarify, and organize new items.
>     
> - **[Engage](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-9)** with the task—in other words, get it done.
>     
> 
> Whereas Covey recommends a weekly schedule, the GTD system emphasizes a weekly _review_ to stay up-to-date with new demands. Additionally, the author notes that as you master the GTD system through time and practice, [you’ll graduate to longer-term planning](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-15).
> 
> - Initially, it’ll take about two years to cement these practices into habit. During that time, the system will primarily improve your time management on an hourly and daily basis.
>     
> - Once the system becomes second nature, you’ll be able to manage your time on a weekly and monthly scope. **At this stage, you can ensure that your actions are aligning with your goals, values, roles, and responsibilities**, as Covey promotes.
>     
> - Finally, you’ll have been effectively managing your time for so long that you’ll transition out of Category-1 tasks and focus almost exclusively on Category-2 activities (though the author doesn’t use these terms). **At this stage, you can dedicate your time to creative, meaningful pursuits that improve your life.**
>     

#### Delegation Is Key

One key Category-2 activity is delegating: Instead of simply reacting to get a task done as quickly as possible, **delegating is a short-term time investment that ultimately gives you more time for important activities.** Covey lists two forms of delegation:

1. “Gofer” delegation involves telling people _what_ to do and _how_ to do it. This is ineffective—it doesn’t free up your time because you’re too busy supervising. Furthermore, your hovering doesn’t give the other person space to develop personal investment in the results.
2. “Stewardship” delegation focuses on the results instead of the methods, giving team members the freedom to choose their approach and have a greater stake in the results. This requires you to trust the other person and allow time and space for them to learn.

> **Four Styles of Delegation**
> 
> Whereas Covey lists only two styles of delegation, The Achievement Centre (TAC), a professional development and coaching organization, lists [four styles of delegation](https://www.tacresults.com/article/stewardship-delegation-makes-difference/). While both sources agree that the most effective style is stewardship delegation, a more thorough list of _ineffective_ strategies can help you identify your delegation style in order to improve it.
> 
> - **Stewardship delegation**, which matches Covey’s description, is the most effective method.
>     
> - **Dump and run**, which involves handing off a task without explaining the desired results, deadline, or available resources. To turn this into stewardship delegation, the manager must provide necessary information and support.
>     
> - **Gopher delegation** (their spelling differs from Covey’s) is defined as assigning individual, isolated tasks without explaining how they fit into larger organizational goals; gopher delegators provide more “what” and “how” information than dump-and-run managers, but they leave out important “why” context. For stewardship delegation, the manager must provide greater context so that the team member understands how they and their work contribute to the team.
>     
> - **Micromanaging**, which actually fits Covey’s description of Gofer delegation, involves the delegator specifying how the task should be completed and constantly monitoring progress. Achieving stewardship delegation requires the delegator to clarify deadlines and expectations for progress reports.
>     

For effective stewardship delegation, Covey contends you must clearly communicate your expectations in six areas:

1. **Results**—What must be accomplished
2. **Guidelines**—The parameters for accomplishing this task, to prevent the other person from unknowingly violating rules or standard operating procedures
3. **Ineffective Methods**—Methods that don’t work, so the other person doesn’t waste time reinventing a broken wheel
4. **Resources**—The manpower, money, technology, or support available to help the person accomplish the task
5. **Accountability**—How and when the results will be evaluated
6. **Consequences**—What will happen if they succeed or fail

(Shortform note: Beyond communicating expectations, [these strategies can make delegation more effective](https://www.inc.com/jayson-demers/7-strategies-to-delegate-better-and-get-more-done.html): Learn to let go of control, start small, play to people’s strengths, teach new skills so you can delegate more, and ask for feedback on how you’re delegating.)

> **Stewardship Delegation Brings Long-Term Benefits**
> 
> Beyond freeing up your time, stewardship delegation gives the person you’re delegating to an opportunity to gain valuable knowledge and experience. Research focused on delegating in an organizational context shows that [this creates a positive ripple effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461250/):
> 
> - The subordinate feels that their job is meaningful and that they have [freedom to innovate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17371082/), which leads to greater job satisfaction, productivity, and dedication to the organization.
>     
> - The subordinate feels that their supervisor has confidence in them, which empowers the subordinate and improves their relationship with their supervisor.
>     
> - The subordinate becomes more motivated to improve their skills, often by seeking constructive feedback.
>     
> - As the subordinate’s expertise grows, it creates a virtuous cycle that benefits both the subordinate and the supervisor.
>     

### Going Deeper

Covey suggests these steps for transitioning to a Category-2 mindset:

- Set a regular time to make each week’s schedule.
- Write a list of tasks you could delegate to others, and write down the specific people you could delegate to. What do you need to do to train people and start handing off these tasks?
- To improve your time awareness, reflect on how much time you currently spend handling tasks in each category. Then log how you spend your time for the next three days, in 15-minute intervals. Were your estimates close to accurate? What do you want to change about how you allocate your time?
- When the week’s over, evaluate the outcome: How well did your accomplishments contribute to your larger goals and values? What could you change to be more effective?

> **Tips for Your Weekly Review**
> 
> Covey and Allen (_Getting Things Done_) both recommend taking time each week to create and review your schedule. [These tips from the GTD system](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done/chapter-8) will help you make the most of Covey’s weekly review steps.
> 
> - Set a day and time you can commit to each week and ensure that you will be focused and uninterrupted. Most people need about two hours.
>     
> - Make sure your to-do list is up-to-date with new and completed items.
>     
> - Reassess the importance and urgency of items as needed.
>     
> - Review everything on your calendar from the past week and consider whether your meetings and appointments produced new tasks to add to your to-do list.
>     
> - Review your upcoming calendar entries and determine whether you need to add any preparation-related tasks.
>     
> - Review the tasks you’ve delegated and determine whether you need to follow up or take any action to spur progress.

### Shortform Commentary: What if You Can't Delegate?

Delegation is a crucial tool for reducing your workload and managing your time—but what do you do if there’s no one to hand tasks to? Covey doesn’t offer advice for this possibility, but other sources provide a few options:

1. **Delegate _up_.** Explain to your boss (or whoever assigned the task) that you have a lot on your plate and [ask them how you should prioritize](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-ways-to-delegate-up-when-youre-at-the-bottom-no-really) this new assignment. Ideally, your boss recognizes that this task is not the best use of your time and assigns it to someone else. This strategy works even better if you can suggest someone whose strengths would be well-suited for this task.
2. **Assess the job.** Get clear on the goal, deadline, and importance of this task. Based on this information, [decide whether you need to do this now](https://maybusch.com/when-you-dont-have-team-to-delegate-to/), schedule it for later, or if you can ignore it (granted, this isn’t often an option).
3. **Delegate small tasks.** Even if you can’t hand off the whole assignment, you might be able to [delegate smaller jobs](https://maybusch.com/when-you-dont-have-team-to-delegate-to/) like information-gathering, which can save you considerable time.
4. **Simplify it.** If you’re stuck with the assignment, find a way to [streamline the process](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-ways-to-delegate-up-when-youre-at-the-bottom-no-really) or use technology to automate it. Once the task is simplified, it’ll be less of a drag on your time and it may be easier to hand off later.
5. **Don’t aim for perfection.** Most tasks don’t need to be done perfectly—they just need to be done. If you can’t get an assignment off your plate, [finish it as quickly and adequately](https://maybusch.com/when-you-dont-have-team-to-delegate-to/) as possible.
