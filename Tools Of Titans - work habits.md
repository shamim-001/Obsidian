## Work Habits and Career

Once you’ve identified your goals, you need to put in the work to reach them. Here are strategies to be more productive and make more progress in the limited time you have.

### You Need to Focus

Does life feel busy to you? It doesn’t have to. If you feel like you’re spinning your wheels and moving really fast, but not making any progress in life, **you probably have to focus your goals**.

The titans in this book have hundreds-fold more opportunities than the typical person, but they don’t have any more time. This means they need to apply a **laser-sharp focus to the opportunities that will fulfill their goals**.

First, let’s examine why people tend to stay “busy,” at the expense of focus:

- Tim Ferriss: People who are busy are, counter-intuitively, often lazy. If you try to do everything, you’re a lazy thinker, since you’re not doing the hard work of defining the few critical actions that matter. Staying busy is also often a way to avoid probing uncomfortable actions.
- Author and cartoonist Tim Kreider: People are busy because, in its absence, they have to confront existential questions they don’t have answers for. Ultimately, in the grand scheme of things, what we do doesn’t matter. This makes people uncomfortable. But if you stay busy, and you’re in demand for every hour of the day, then your life can’t _possibly_ be meaningless.

Next, here’s guidance on how to define your goals.

- Philosopher William MacAskill: **It’s worth spending a lot of time to define your life’s important goals.** Each day, you might spend half an hour figuring out what you want to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That’s nearly 3% of the day. If instead you spend that time on figuring out your goals, that would be nearly 2 full working years, just spent on figuring out how to live.
- From music producer Kaskade: Imagine you have a glass jar, and next to it big rocks, pebbles, and sand. If you put the sand and pebbles in first, they take up all the space, and you can’t fit the big rocks in. But if you add the big rocks, then the pebbles, then the sand, everything fits. Likewise, if you focus on the minor to-do items, you won’t be able to fit the big priorities in.
- Author Derek Sivers has a rule for evaluating opportunities: “If it’s not a ‘hell, yes!’ it’s a ‘no.” If an opportunity doesn’t immediately excite him, it’s probably not that helpful to his goals, and so it’s not worth his time.
- Entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant: “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” ([Source](https://twitter.com/naval/status/846774878195757057)) Naval Ravikant is therefore careful to choose his desires carefully and avoids having more than one big desire at any time. **Focus helps you avoid the anxiety and disappointment from having dozens of unfulfilled wants.**
- Investor Chris Sacca invests in tech companies, but he deliberately chooses to live outside of San Francisco, in Tahoe. This gives him more mental freedom and control over his to-do list.

When defining goals, deliberately choose only a few of them, and make them clear. Avoid these pitfalls that erode focus:

- “Buridan’s ass” is a fable where a donkey that is both hungry and thirsty is placed midway between hay and water. Unable to make a choice, the donkey dies. Likewise, don’t pursue all the directions at once, making progress on none.
- Don’t let other people define your to-do list. Chris Sacca notes that your email inbox is a to-do list that anyone in the world can add an item to.
- Author Maria Popova: As you succeed, you’ll get more and more requests from people. This puts the quality of your work at risk, and you have to protect that.
- Beware of the delusion that you can do a lot of things, just in moderation, like “I’ll limit myself to just 5 hours a week” or “I’ll dabble just a bit in investing.” If success in the area requires all-or-nothing effort, and you can’t give it your all, you need to cut it off completely.
- LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman: For him to pursue any opportunity, there needs to be one decisive, compelling reason to do it. If it’s a blended reason with lots of minor reasons that are individually unsatisfying, it’ll probably be a waste of time. He cites attending an industry conference as an example.
- Avoid a “culture of cortisol.” There’s so much emphasis on being busy and fear of missing out that you can go day to day perpetually anxious. There really shouldn’t be many emergencies in your life. Focus on your big goals, and cut out the 20% of things that cause 80% of your unhappiness.

### Deciding What to Work On

In a world of endless options, it can be hard to decide what to focus on and build your career around. Here are themes of advice from the titans.

**Become a double/triple threat.** Many people try to become the very best in the world at one specific thing, the equivalent of playing basketball well enough to make the NBA. But this is very competitive and has a low probability of success. Instead, you can easily become above average at two or more things, then combine them to great effect.

- Entrepreneur and investor [Marc Andreessen agrees](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html), citing these 5 skills as useful to augment any career: communication, management, sales, finance, and internationalization.

**Work in an area where you’re not easily replaceable.** This is where you can make a unique impact.

- While Tim Ferriss was building his following around self-improvement, he contemplated becoming a full-time venture capitalist (VC). Investor Kamal Ravikant nudged him away, saying that he’d be just like any other VC, and if a company didn’t get his investment, they’d just find another investor. In contrast, Tim’s listeners wrote to him with dramatic stories of personal transformation, and he’d never have that impact as a VC.

**Question the value of formal education.** Think about taking the tuition you would have spent on school, then using it on something that would move you along faster.

- Tim Ferriss was interested in business, but instead of getting an MBA, he took that $120,000 and decided to invest in startups. He was mentally OK with losing all of it—he would have spent it on tuition anyway—but he gained valuable experience in building companies, experiences he would never have gotten in school.
- Likewise, can you use the thousands of dollars in tuition to make some major change in your life, like working less to pursue a side project, or paying people for advice?

### It’s OK to Be Away From Hotspots

Are you outside of the hotspot for your industry or career? People often use this as an excuse for failure or not starting: “I’m not in the city where all the action’s happening, so I can’t do what I want to do.”

Don’t worry about being outside the epicenter. This can actually give you advantages to compensate.

- Investor Chris Sacca lives in a cabin in Tahoe, away from Silicon Valley. He found this helped him separate from the noise and focus on his priorities. It also gave him a hangout spot that friends and business partners wanted to go to.
- Olympic-medalist snowboarder Shaun White: Snowboarders typically train in snowy places like Vermont or Colorado, but the cold and hiking on mountains can crush your spirit and desire to practice. He chose to live in Southern California, making up for less available snow with more enthusiasm for life.
- Master sommelier Richard Betts was deciding where to build his career. He found two well-regarded chefs in Tucson, Arizona. Since few people want to move to Tucson, he saw this as an opportunity to get higher-than-usual access and learn faster.

### Design Your Work So You Learn From Failures

Some people worry that if they try something and fail, they’ll have wasted time and gained nothing.

But it doesn’t have to work out this way. Organize your work so that even if you fail, you still grow tremendously along the way.

- Tim Ferriss started podcasts on a whim, knowing that if he failed, he’d still learn the techniques of audio production and get to interview cool people.
- Dilbert creator Scott Adams: Instead of working toward specific goals, think about developing “systems” or habits.
    - For example, instead of losing ten pounds, develop a system of learning how to eat more healthily and move actively in a way that’s pleasing.
- Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez failed in his film _Four Rooms_, but the cast directly led him to envision _Spy Kids_, and he reproduced a similar plot structure in _Sin City_.

Even when you fail, take some joy in it—it’s an opportunity to learn and get better

- Robert Rodriguez: If you fail when the stakes are low, that’s great—it’s much better you train now than fail when the stakes are high.
- Navy SEAL and author Jocko Willink practices saying “Good” after each failure.
    - Didn’t get promoted? Good. That’s more time to get better and try again.
    - Didn’t get your startup funded? Good. You get to keep more of the company and control your destiny.
    - Get beaten in a competition? Good. You learned a weakness to get rid of.

### Simplify Your Problem

Does reaching your goal seem like an insurmountably high effort? You might be overthinking it. Instead, take some time to think about how you can simplify your problem.

- LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman: Business strategy isn’t necessarily about solving the most difficult problem, but rather the simplest, most valuable problem.
- Toy designer Lynn Gordon was having trouble getting business for her toy designs. Instead, she took her creativity to the book publishing industry. She got a hit with her 52 activity card deck series.
- Musician Justin Boreta (of The Glitch Mob): When he gets stuck, he asks, “What would this look like if it were easy?”

(Shortform note: The book isn’t exactly clear about how to apply this, but here are some ideas:

- Instead of competing in your current area, find a way to apply your skills that give you much more leverage or bigger results.
- Solve the easier problem that unlocks the bigger market.
- Find a way to apply the same effort and do the same thing, but earn a 10x bigger reward.)

### Work Tactics

Here are more tactics for work and career recommended by the titans.

If you’re overwhelmed by unread emails, consider declaring **email bankruptcy**. You tell your contacts that you won’t be reading any email before today, and if it’s important enough they should send it again. This can relieve a lot of guilt and stress, though be sure to do it only when you’ve set up good habits to reduce your email load into the future, or you’ll just need to declare bankruptcy again.

**Surround yourself with people who are more successful than you.** This isn’t as gentle on your ego as being around people less successful than you, but it’ll make you more successful. Here are **3 specific people to keep watching**:

- A senior you want to emulate
- A peer who is better at the job than you
- A subordinate who’s doing the job you did, better than you did
