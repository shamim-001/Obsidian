## Chapter 23: Getting Started with 10X

To get started, just look at the list of success traits in Chapter 22 and determine what you need to do.

**Make a list of your goals, then a list of actions, then start taking those actions.**

Keep in mind:

- Don’t scale back your goals as you write them.
- Don’t get hung on the details of how to achieve them.
- Write down what you can do today to move toward these goals.
- Take the actions you list, regardless of your feelings.
- Don’t prematurely judge the outcome of your actions.
- Review the list each day.

Don’t give in to the urge to wait, or try to talk yourself out of acting. Changing your life is like being in a vehicle that’s stuck in the mud; you only need enough traction to move a few inches. It will get messy, but soon you’ll make real progress.

Act now (not a few minutes from now) and keep acting with the assurance that by doing everything in your power in the present, you’re creating the future. **Nothing—whether it’s financial problems, fears, past failures, or other challenges—is bigger than your ability to dream and act at 10X levels.**
