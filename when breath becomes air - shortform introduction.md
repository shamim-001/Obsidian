## Shortform Introduction

This summary of _When Breath Becomes Air_ is written in a way that allows you to share in the experience provided by the memoir. Most of the beauty in this book comes from the relationship formed with Paul as you walk in his shoes. His personal stories and observations are strengthened by his thoughtful voice and elegant prose.

Therefore, simply reading about the content of the story seems insufficient in expressing the emotional journey. To really provide you with the sensation this book creates, we wrote in the first person, using a voice similar to his. The hope is you will be able to form that personal attachment with his story and be taken on a similar journey. As usual, if you enjoyed this summary, we highly recommend reading the original book for the full experience. Reading the words coming directly from him is a powerful experience we can’t replace.

The original book is written in two major parts. To make it more digestible, we’ve divided them into smaller chapters. Chapters 1-4 correspond to Part 1, and Chapters 5-8 correspond to Part 2.
