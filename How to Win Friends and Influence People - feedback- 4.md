## Feedback 4: Ask Questions Instead of Giving Orders

Now that the problem is known, present how to fix the problem.

### Principles

- **Instead of issuing orders, ask questions.**
- It allows your partner to come to her own conclusions independently. People like their own ideas better.
- It preserves agency, importance, and pride. Instead of following someone else’s orders, the person is now following her own. They have ownership in the path forward.
- It stimulates the creativity of your partner. New better ideas might actually surface.

### Tactics

- “You might consider this.” “Do you think that would work?” “What do you think of this?”
- When the solution is unclear to you, ask your staff on what to do.

### Examples

- A manager of a manufacturing plant wanted to take a large order but wasn’t convinced they could service it in time. He asked his staff questions. “Is there anything we can do to handle this order? Can we think of different ways to process it?”
