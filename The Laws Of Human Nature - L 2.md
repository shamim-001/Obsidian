## Law #2: People Are Grandiose

In the previous law, we learned about narcissists who have malformed self-images. In this law, we’ll look at people who have inflated ones.

**Grandiosity is our natural tendency to inflate our self-image and assume that we’re more skilled than we actually are.** It increases as we age—the more we experience successes, however small, the more people confirm our grandiose self-opinion.

There are two types of grandiosity:

1. **Fantastical.** This grandiosity is divorced from reality—we think that everything that goes right is due to our superior skills, and anytime something goes wrong, it’s someone else’s fault. We focus more on our dreams and wishes than on actually getting anything done. Fantastically grandiose people see themselves as gods.
2. **Practical.** This grandiosity acknowledges that our success comes from our work and our skills.

First, we’ll study the development of grandiosity. Then, we’ll use this law to manage toxic types and to control our own nature.

### Study the Law: The Development of Modern Grandiosity

Grandiosity develops in early childhood. As we realized that we were separate beings from our mothers, **we also realized that we were dependent and powerless. In response to this realization, we fantasized about being great and powerful**—for example, by imagining we had superhero powers like flying or seeing through walls.

As we grew up, most of us experienced a second realization—that we’re small and powerless in other ways besides depending on our parents. We have limited skills, we’re one of the billions of people on the planet, and there’s a lot we can’t control. These realizations also make us fantasize about having power and feel grandiose.

**Most people alternate between these two states, feeling small and feeling grand.** However, children who don’t experience the second realization—for example, their parents spoil them so they never have to come to terms with the fact that they’re powerless—spend more time thinking about power, and this makes them more susceptible to grandiosity.

#### Expression of Grandiosity

Grandiosity can be expressed in many ways, though there are fewer outlets today than they were in the past. **In older times, people met their need for grandiosity with religion—gods and spirits allowed us to be part of something bigger and grander than ourselves—or by following a leader with a strong cause—**if a leader did something great, their followers shared in the success.

Now that fewer people believe in something and there are fewer great leaders, **we have to express our grandiosity in some other way. Many of us turn to worshipping ourselves,** most commonly by trying to get social status through doing something prestigious or helping people. This works to some extent for talented people—they will have success and get the admiration they crave—but they’ll eventually get involved with projects that are beyond their abilities.

Additionally, people try to cope with their need for grandiosity by doing the following:

- Compensating with drugs, a superior attitude, alcohol, and so on.
- Faking humility. Some people try to hide their grandiosity by being visibly humble. For example, they might talk about how they don’t want status. However, this is still grandiosity, because it gets them attention.
- Playing the victim. These people get themselves into situations where they’re suffering, and the more they suffer, the more superior they feel—they’ve suffered so much already they shouldn’t have to help anyone else.
- Worshiping a leader with a cause. Followers can feel superior to people who don’t believe in the cause.
- Idealizing people they love.

People who don’t have an outlet for their grandiosity are often manic, alternating between being excited by their next project and being depressed when they realize they won’t be able to complete it.

#### Grandiosity in Modern Times

While there are fewer outlets for grandiosity today than there were in the past, people have more grandiose tendencies than ever because:

- **We live in a time when children are more spoiled.** Spoiled children are less likely to realize they aren’t all-powerful, which makes them more susceptible to grandiosity.
- **Fewer people respect authority or expertise.** If people don’t have a sense that others are superior to them, they think their own ideas are just as legitimate.
- **Technology has made it easy for anyone to quickly access information.** This makes some people think that it doesn’t take time and study to be an expert—they can get to the same level via the Internet. People also tend to believe their skills are more transferable. For example, they think if they’re good at business, they might also be good at theme park design.
- **Social media makes it possible to create an idealized image of ourselves** and believe that many people are interested in us.
- **There’s no longer any survival association with grandiosity.** Fantastical grandiosity would have gotten our ancestors killed—people who couldn’t realistically assess their skills would try things that would kill them—but the modern world isn’t dangerous in the same way.

### Manage Toxic Types: The Grandiose

Everyone falls somewhere on the scale of grandiosity, and you can figure out if people have lower or higher grandiosity by studying the following behaviors:

- **Response to criticism.** People with high grandiosity can’t take criticism and will get angry and hysterical, or try to make the criticizer feel guilty.
- **Consistency.** Most powerful people let themselves relax when they’re in private. Grandiose people, however, believe that their powerful self is their real self, so they act the same in all situations.
- **Credit-taking.** Grandiose people take credit for everything, even if it’s not very related to their work.
- **Insensitive remarks.** Grandiose people assume everyone will agree with them and give them the benefit of the doubt, so they often don’t think before they speak.
- **Low empathy.** Grandiose people see other people as tools and don’t listen well.
- **Nonverbal cues.** Grandiose people gesture dramatically, talk loudly and quickly, and take up space with their bodies.

**When you encounter people with low, everyday grandiosity, indulge them.** Grandiosity is normal.

**When you come across people with high grandiosity, avoid getting close to them.** In personal relationships, they’ll demand attention but won’t reciprocate it. In professional situations, they can’t accurately assess their own skills and abilities and end up with responsibilities they can’t complete. Be skeptical of what highly grandiose people say and judge their ideas and behavior itself, not what they say about it. Don’t try to expose their grandiosity; they’ll just get angry.

#### Grandiose Leaders

**People who have high grandiosity and also have talent and energy are good at winning power** because they can create a confident, mythic image that attracts people.

Grandiose leaders use six theatrical devices to create this larger-than-life image by creating the impression that they’re:

**1. Fated to succeed.** They tell stories about their childhood in which they’re uniquely talented in some way as if they’d been given gifts at birth (sometimes these stories are made up, sometimes they’re reinterpretations of reality). They also tell stories about impressive past successes that they achieved despite considerable opposition.

To fight this technique, track down more objective versions of their stories and share them.

**2. Just like the average person.** Grandiose leaders try to be representative of the average person to connect with the largest audience. They visibly demonstrate that they have the same interests and tastes as the general public, even if they come from a different class. Sometimes they even criticize the elite class.

- For example, Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi came from a powerful family, studied in Europe, and hadn’t spent much time in the poorer parts of India. However, she created the impression she was an average person by speaking colloquially, wearing her sari in the local fashion, eating with her fingers, and calling herself “Mother Indira.”

To avoid falling prey to this tactic, look for contradictions between the leader’s real persona and background, and the one they present.

**3. A savior.** When there’s a crisis, grandiose people can often gain power because their high self-confidence is reassuring. They make large, simple, vague promises that are inspiring but also impossible to hold them accountable for. Saviors also find scapegoats who they can turn the public against to unify the group. They also unify the group with slogans, colors, music, and so on. The leaders tend to create cult-like organizations.

All you can do about this tactic is to remain analytical. You’ll never be able to convince believers that their leader has any negative qualities.

**4. A rule-breaker.** Everyone secretly wants to dispense with rules and get power in their own way, so when a leader does this, their followers live vicariously through them. Another version of this technique is to prioritize their hunches and intuition rather than science or expert opinions. They like to think they have a magical connection to how the world works.

- For example, film director Michael Cimino appeared to his fans as someone who could break the rules of Hollywood. He managed to negotiate a film contract that gave him almost full control of the project. He made use of it—once, he waited for the perfect cloud to appear before filming—and the movie (_Heaven’s Gate_) was hugely expensive and five hours long.

To fight this tactic, whenever you hear someone talk about their rule-breaking abilities, realize that they don’t have any special powers.

**5. A guarantor of success.** This technique involves grandiose leaders spinning the past so that they can say they’ve never failed. Anytime something went wrong, they blame it on something else. Additionally, they tend to believe that their skills are transferable and they’ll succeed at anything they try, even if they don’t have experience.

- For example, Douglas MacArthur, a U.S. Army general, claimed that he’d never lost a battle. According to him, all his losses could be explained by excuses or betrayals.

To avoid falling for this trick, look for failures in a leader’s past, and then share what you find.

**6. Invincible.** Grandiose leaders by nature take risks—they have to, to hold attention—and much of the time, they manage to make things turn out all right. They also like the feeling of risk. They actually _are_ somewhat invulnerable, up until the point where they overreach.

To deal with this tactic, dismantle the leader’s mythic image. The leader needs to have constant validation and attention, or else their confidence disappears and they can’t maintain their grandiosity. If you denounce them, they’ll probably get emotional, as will their followers, but eventually, some of their followers may realize they’ve been taken in.

### Control Your Own Nature: Learn Practical Grandiosity

**It’s hard to recognize grandiosity in yourself because when you’re experiencing it, you’re not seeing reality.** It’s also hard to learn from your mistakes because this would require you to admit that you’re not as great as you thought you were.

If you’re suffering from grandiosity, you might take on projects that are too advanced. You might jump from project to project because your current work isn’t confirming your grandiosity. You might be passive because you feel you deserve things, so instead of working towards them, you’ll wait for other people to give them to you.

There are several strategies to channel your grandiose tendencies into practical grandiosity:

**Strategy #1: Acknowledge that you have grandiose tendencies** and that your self-opinion may not be objectively accurate. Remember that you’re not inherently better than anyone.

**Strategy #2: Choose one goal and stick to it.** Fantastical grandiosity makes you inclined to jump from project to project as you imagine the attention you could get. Ideally, you’ll get so absorbed in this one project that you think about all the time, instead of fantasizing about the glory you could get from other projects. This project should also play to your skills.

**Strategy #3: Balance imagination and analysis.** When you first start projects, be open to all ideas. Once you have a better sense of the idea, seek out feedback. Ask others to point out potential flaws and analyze what you did wrong. The balance is important—too much imagination and you’ll fall victim to unrealistic grandiosity; too much analysis and your work will be conventional.

Watch out for signs of complacency—if you focus on yourself, you focus less on your work and don’t innovate.

**Strategy #4: Choose appropriately difficult challenges.** Grandiosity blinds you to difficulty. You tend to see projects as not very hard and people as likely to do what you want. You focus on what you’ll get if you succeed, not how to actually get there, so you can’t see the scale of the task.

In truth, getting anything done is hard: It takes a lot of effort, innovation, luck, and willingness to go back to the drawing board. People will resist you in ways you might not have anticipated. Your skills have limits.

To choose an appropriate challenge, look for projects that are just a little bit above your skill level—the challenge will keep you engaged, energized, and focused. If you succeed, you’ll increase your confidence; if you fail, you can learn from it.

If you pick a project that’s too far above your abilities, you’ll either quit or the project will end in disaster (for example, over budget).

**Strategy #5: Pay attention to your body’s signals.** When you do things that are beyond your limits, you’ll get headaches and feel tired, grouchy, and nervous. If you do things that you have a talent for, on the other hand, you have more energy and learn faster, and doing the task feels easy.

Additionally, when something goes right, you’ll feel a little scared that you might not be able to keep it up—this is your body telling you to watch out for grandiose feelings.

**Strategy #6: Scrutinize your successes.** When something goes right, recognize that luck and help were involved. No success is wholly our own—we always had help from teachers or contributors, or we had good timing. Additionally, don’t let past successes influence your next project. Every time you start something new, imagine it’s the first thing you’ve ever done and you have no track record.

**Strategy #7: Let your grandiose tendencies escape occasionally.** Every once in a while, consider taking on projects that are beyond your current limits, brainstorm new skills you want to learn, or demonstrate your self-confidence.

> **Extended Example: Michael Eisner**
> 
> Michael Eisner, a former Disney executive, is an example of a grandiose leader. **Like most grandiose leaders, his grandiosity developed in childhood**—his mother spoiled him, even doing his homework for him, and protected him from his cold father.
> 
> Eisner had early, earned success in the film world and in 1984 went to work for the struggling Walt Disney Company. He turned the company around: His tried-and-true film formula—a great concept with a low budget—resulted in major hits including _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, and he stumbled on never-before-seen cartoons that he very successfully reissued for home video.
> 
> **Eisner’s grandiosity had been rising throughout his career and at this point, he started to fall victim to grandiosity’s delusions.** He started to feel like he and Walt had a magical connection. **He also attributed Disney’s success entirely to himself,** failing to take into account chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg’s talent, second-in-command Frank Wells’ detail-orientation, and luck (Eisner happened to find the unpublished cartoons right as the home video market took off).
> 
> **Eisner became restless and decided to work on Disney’s new theme park, assuming his skills were transferable. They weren’t**—he chose the wrong site (rainy Paris instead of sunny Barcelona), priced the hotel rooms too high, and had failed to understand the vacation habits of the French. It was the first disaster in his career, and he blamed Frank Wells because he was in charge of the project’s financial health.
> 
> Eisner’s grandiosity continued to plague him. He abandoned his lower-cost formula and tried to make blockbusters. He felt threatened by Katzenberg and fired him. **He took on projects that were too big for him to manage alone,** such as acquiring the film studio ABC and trying to start an Internet portal.
> 
> Eventually, Disney’s share price dropped so much Roy Disney asked Eisner to resign. Eisner still couldn’t see his own grandiosity and was offended because he was the person who had “single-handedly” saved Disney all those years ago. He attacked Roy, and Roy attacked back, and **Eisner was stripped of his position, his downfall brought about by his grandiosity.**
