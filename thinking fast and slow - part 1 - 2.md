# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Part 1-2: System 2 Has a Maximum Capacity

System 2 thinking has a **limited budget of attention** - you can only do so many cognitively difficult things at once.

This limitation is true when doing two tasks at the same time - if you’re navigating traffic on a busy highway, it becomes far harder to solve a multiplication problem.

This limitation is also true when one task comes after another - depleting System 2 resources earlier in the day can lower inhibitions later. For example, a hard day at work will make you more susceptible to impulsive buying from late-night infomercials. This is also known as “ego depletion,” or the idea that you have a limited pool of willpower or mental resources that can be depleted each day.

All forms of voluntary effort - cognitive, emotional, physical - seem to draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy.

- Stifling emotions during a sad film worsens physical stamina later.
- Memorizing a list of seven digits makes subjects more likely to yield to more decadent desserts.

### Differences in Demanding Tasks

The law of least effort states that **“if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action.”**

What makes some cognitive operations more demanding than others? Here are a few examples:

- Holding in memory several ideas that require separate actions (like memorizing a supermarket shopping list). System 1 is not capable of dealing with multiple distinct topics at once.
- Obeying an instruction that overrides habitual responses, thus requiring “executive control.”
    - This covers cognitive, emotional, and physical impulses of all kinds.
- Switching between tasks.
- Time pressure.

In the lab, the strain of a cognitive task can be measured by pupil size - the harder the task, the more the pupil dilates, in real time. Heart rate also increases.

Kahneman cites one particular task as the limit of what most people can do in the lab, dilating the pupil by 50% and increasing heart rate by 7bpm. The task is “Add-3”:

- Write several 4 digit numbers on separate index cards.
- To the beat of a metronome, read the four digits aloud.
- Wait for two beats, then report a string in which each of the original digits is incremented by 3 (eg 4829 goes to 7152).

If you make the task any harder than this, most people give up. Mentally speaking, this is sprinting as hard as you can, whereas casual conversation is a leisurely stroll.

Because System 2 has limited resources, **stressful situations make it harder to think clearly.** Stressful situations may be caused by:

- Physical exertion: In intense exercise, you need to apply mental resistance to the urge to slow down. Even a physical activity as relaxed as taking a stroll involves the use of mental resources. Therefore, the most complex arguments might be done while sitting.
- The presence of distractions.
- Exercising self-control or willpower in general.

Because of the fixed capacity, **you cannot will yourself to think harder in the moment** and surpass the “Add-3” limit, even with a gun to your head. In the same way, you cannot sprint any faster than you can possibly sprint.

#### How to Make Difficult Tasks Easier

But there are some ways to make a mentally demanding task easier:

- Get more skilled. The more skilled you get at a task, the less energy it consumes. Thus experts can solve situations that require far more intense work for novices (such as diagnosing a disease for doctors, or making a chess move for a grandmaster).
- In a state of flow, you can concentrate energy without having to exert willpower, thus freeing your entire mental faculty to the task. Flow has been described as one of the most enjoyable states of life.
    - (Shortform note: flow theory suggests three conditions have to be met to get into flow: 1) Clear set of goals and progress. 2) Clear and immediate feedback, to adjust your performance to maintain flow. 3) Good balance between perceived challenges and perceived skills - a confidence in your ability to complete the task.)
- Get incentives for your behavior. When given proper incentives, people resisted ego depletion.
- Eat. Consuming more glucose seems to undo ego depletion, since cognitive effort depletes blood glucose.
    - A well-known [study of Iraeli judges](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889) showed that, after meals, the judges were more lenient about awarding parole to prisoners.
- Playing computer games requiring attention and control may improve executive control and intelligence scores.

As we’ll find later, when System 2 is taxed, it has less firepower to question the conclusions of System 1.

### Cognitive Ease

**Cognitive ease** is an internal measure of how easy or strained your cognitive load is.

In a state of cognitive ease, you’re probably in a good mood, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, feel the situation is familiar, are more creative, and are superficial in your thinking. System 1 is humming along, and System 2 accepts what System 1 says.

In a state of cognitive strain, you’re more vigilant and suspicious, feel less comfortable, invest more effort, and trigger System 2. **You make fewer errors, but you’re also less intuitive and less creative.**

Cognitive ease increases with certain inputs or characteristics of the task, including:

- Repeated experience
- Clear display
- Primed idea
- Good mood

You don’t consciously know exactly what it is that makes it easy or strained. Rather, the ease of the task gets compressed into a single “is this easy” factor that then determines the level of mental strain you need to apply.

Drilling down into each input:

#### Repeated Experience / Mere Exposure / Familiarity

**Exposing someone to an input repeatedly makes them like it more.** Having a memory of a word, phrase, or idea makes it easier to see again.

Example experiments:

- People are exposed to a set of made-up names. A few days later, they are given a list of names and asked to point out which names belong to celebrities. The subjects are more likely to falsely identify the random names as those of celebrities if they were previously exposed to them.
- People are exposed to a set of Turkish words at different frequencies. When they are later asked to rate a set of words on a good-bad scale, the subjects perceive the more frequently shown words as more positive.

Even a single occurrence can make an idea familiar.

- Say a car lights on fire a block away from your house. The first time, it’s shocking. The second time you see it, it is far less surprising than the first time it happened.

If the new idea fits your existing mental framework, you will digest it more easily.

Evolutionarily, this benefits the organism by saving cognitive load. If a stimulus has occurred in the past and hasn’t caused danger, later occurrences of that stimulus can be discarded. This saves cognitive energy for new surprising stimuli that might indicate danger.

However, this can cause a potentially dangerous bias. **You will tend to like the ideas you are exposed to most often, regardless of the merit of those ideas.**

You cannot easily distinguish familiarity from the truth. If you think an idea is true, is it only because it’s been repeated so often, or is it actually true? (Shortform note: thus, be aware of “common sense” intuitions that seem true merely because they’re repeated often, like “searing meat seals in the juices.”)

Furthermore, if you trust a source, you are more likely to believe what is said.

#### Clear Display

You can use the idea of cognitive ease to convince people to believe in the truth of something you’ve written. In general, to be more persuasive, make the message as easy to digest as possible. In other words, ease your listener’s cognitive load.

Consider the two statements:

- **Adolf Hitler was born in 1891.**
- Adolf Hitler was born in 1887.

Which one do you think is correct?

You likely found the first one a bit more believable, because it stood out. In reality, Hitler was born in 1889.

Here are tips to making your message more persuasive:

- Increase the contrast and make it easier to read. Use high-quality paper.
- If colored, use vivid colors of blue or red rather than pale neutral colors.
- Use simpler language. Pretentious language is interpreted as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.
- Make your ideas rhyme and put them in verse if you can.
    - “Woes unite foes.” is interpreted as more meaningful as “Woes unite enemies.”
- When citing a source, choose one with an easier name to pronounce.

(Shortform note: In the O.J. Simpson trial, both mere exposure and clear display were used in catchphrases like “if the glove doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”)

In contrast, **making cognition difficult actually activates System 2.**

- For the $1.10 bat and ball problem you saw in the last chapter, making print smaller and difficult to read increased the accuracy of responses significantly.

#### Emotions

Cognitive ease is associated with good feelings. In contrast, cognitive strain tends to promote bad feelings.

- Stocks with phonetically reasonable symbols (like KAR) outperform non-words like PXG or RDO. This is likely because symbols you can pronounce lessen your cognitive load. This leads to more positive associations with the stock.

The causality also works in the opposite direction: **your emotional state affects your thinking**.

- In the three-word creative association test (in Part 1-3, below), people instructed to think about sad memories were half as accurate in their intuition as those who thought about happy memories.
- **When we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition**. (But we are also more engaged with our System 2).

#### You Can’t Always Tell Why Something is Easy

Again, cognitive ease is a summary feeling that takes in multiple inputs and squishes them together to form a general impression. When you feel cognitively at ease, you’re not always aware oft why - it might be that the idea is actually sound and fits your correct view of the world, or that it’s simply printed with high contrast and has a nice rhyme.

Cognitive ease is associated with a “**pleasant feeling of truth**.” But things that seem intuitively true may actually be false on inspection.

### The Link Between System 2 Capacity and Intelligence

Given that self-control and cognitive tasks draw from the same pool of energy, is there a relationship between self-control and intelligence?

Walter Mischel’s [famous marshmallow experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment) showed that children who better endured delayed gratification showed significantly better life outcomes, measured by SAT scores, education attainment, and body mass index.

Inversely, those who score lower on the [Cognitive Reflection Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reflection_test) show more impulsive behavior, such as being more willing to pay for overnight delivery, or being less willing to wait for more time to receive more money. Poor scorers also show a greater tendency to fall prey to fallacies like the gambler’s fallacy (the assumption that if something occurs more frequently than usual now, it will happen _less_ frequently than usual in the future) and sunk cost fallacy (discussed in Part 4-4).

As with most things in life, it appears that executive control has been attributed to both genetics and environment (parenting techniques).
