## Chapter 10: Good Communication Is About Listening

This chapter explains how an organization--especially a large one--can communicate its WHY to the marketplace effectively.

This centers around two big ideas: the power of symbols and The Celery Test.

### **The Power of Symbols**

A symbol is defined as an object imbued with additional meaning**. It’s an object that represents an idea bigger than the thing itself.**

Here are two examples of powerful symbols:

- **The United States Flag:** Literally, the flag is just a few pieces of cloth stitched together. But as a nation, Americans assign powerful symbolic meaning to it. It represents the beliefs of the country—freedom, equality, and opportunity. It’s such an important symbol that people will follow it into war.
- **Ronald Reagan’s “Hero”:** In 1982, Lenny Skutnik was invited to sit in the House chamber during the State of the Union Address. A few weeks earlier, Skutnik had jumped into the Potomac to save passengers after an Air Florida airplane crashed. President Reagan understood the power of symbolism, and Skutnik’s presence was a powerful representation of American bravery and values.

**All societies use symbols to reinforce their core beliefs.** And the stronger the core belief, the more powerful the symbol.

#### Logos: The Symbols of Business

Logos are a visual object that identify a company, but they can also be symbols of what a company stands for.

Unfortunately, most companies don’t use their logos this way. Instead, companies act like dictators, telling customers who they are, what they do, and why we should be loyal to them. And like dictators, these companies manipulate people into following them. In these cases, company logos are just a way to communicate the business’s name, not to share their meaning.

In order to work as a symbol, a logo--and the company behind it--must be inspirational. **The logo has to tell people something about the company _beyond_ what they sell: it has to symbolize the company’s beliefs.**

Take the Harley-Davidson logo, for instance The logo isn’t just a motorcycle brand anymore. It represents more than that: it symbolizes an outlaw mentality. The logo is so meaningful that merchandising makes up 12 percent of the company’s revenue.

The major takeaway for businesses is this: symbols are another way to amplify your message using the Golden Circle megaphone, because they can quickly and easily communicate your WHY.

### **The Celery Test**

Trying to communicate your WHY effectively and make decisions in accordance with WHY can feel overwhelming. That’s why Sinek developed the Celery Test, **a heuristic to determine what communications “best practices” really _are_ the best practices for your business.**

Here’s how the Celery Test works: imagine you’re starting a new health food store. Your WHY is to sell foods that are healthy and improve people’s well-being. You go to a dinner party where people give you advice about your new health food store. One person approaches you and tells you that you need more M&Ms, another person suggests adding celery instead, and a third person tells you to buy Oreos.

All of these people are successful and give good advice, so it's tempting to go right out to the supermarket and buy exactly what they recommended. But that will result in purchasing an armful of mismatched products which might not add value to your organization.

**The better tactic is to go into the grocery store knowing your WHY.** If the WHY of your health food store is to make sure people have access to healthy food, then the answer is obvious - you don’t need M&Ms or Oreos, but you buy the celery. In essence, **the Celery Test acts as a filter to whittle down all the possible options into only the few that support your WHY**.

Case in point - celery being the right answer was probably obvious to you when you first read the scenario. That’s the magic of a clear, concise heuristic - it makes decision making easy, because you know what decisions align with your WHY, and which ones don’t.

The Celery Test works for both short-term and long-term decisions:

- **Short-term decisions.** Sometimes you have to make decisions that don’t align with your mission. It’s the equivalent of eating a piece of chocolate cake when you’re on a diet: you know that it’s not in line with your WHY, so you understand it’s just a temporary fix. The Celery Test, then, can help you keep these types of short-term decisions to a minimum and help you adhere to the path to a better, long-term solution.
- **Long-term decisions.** Sometimes, the long-term decision you need to make seem scary or require a lot of investment, like opening new locations or creating a new product. But if those tough decisions pass The Celery Test, it gives you the confidence to dive in.

Other advantages of The Celery Method include:

- spending less time at the metaphorical supermarket (you know what you need)
- getting value out of your investments (they’re right for your company)
- showing your WHY through your actions (making decisions that align with your beliefs)

Obviously, not every company or organization is looking for healthy foods. But every organization should have a WHY. That’s what makes The Celery Test--which puts your WHY front and center--a great filter for your decision-making process.

Because of its simplicity, **the Celery Test scales well to fit your entire organization**. For people who create the HOW and people who execute the WHAT, knowing a clear, simple WHY makes decision making easy for them on a day-to-day basis.

#### Examples of Celery Tests

Here are two examples of companies that have passed (and failed) The Celery Test:

**Disney**: Disney’s strong WHY is to produce family friendly entertainment. This WHY is apparent to all its audience members and has been demonstrated over decades of discipline and consistency. Because of that, parents rarely worry about taking their kids to Disney movies or buying Disney products. Disney passes the Celery Test of whether its products are family friendly.

**Volkswagen**: Volkswagen is a company known for its friendliness to people, mass appeal, and hippie ideals (picture the VW van common in the 1970s). In 2004, they introduced the Phaeton, a $70,000 luxury car. The problem? Volkswagen's WHY was making great cars for everyday people. The product didn’t align with their WHY, so it didn’t succeed. Had they used the Celery Test, they could have ruled out the Phaeton as incompatible with their mission.

- In contrast, Toyota created an entirely new brand, Lexus, to create luxury cars.
