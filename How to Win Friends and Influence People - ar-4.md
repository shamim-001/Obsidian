## Arguments 4: If You’re Wrong, Admit It

### Principles

- So many people instinctively fight for their right of way that admitting your error is disarming. Few people want to kick someone who’s already down - they may in fact jump to your defense and build you back up.
    - **When a person’s importance is acknowledged, she can build her ego further only by showing mercy**.
- (Shortform note: much of an argument is about making sure the other person realizes she’s wrong. This is why being defensive makes the other person angrier. If you admit you’re wrong, then the other person will start repairing.)

### Tactics

- If making a mistake at work, admit it quickly without making excuses. Your colleagues may jump to your defense, minimizing the impact of your mistake.
- Get over the pride that the other person should yield first and admit her mistake. The other person is feeling the same way. If you care about results, then admit your mistake first.
- If someone criticizes your work, be gracious. “To be honest, I don’t entirely agree with it myself. Not everything I write yesterday appeals to me today. I’m glad to learn what you think about this.”
- **Say about yourself all the derogatory things the other person is thinking.** A forgiving attitude will come and your mistakes will be minimized.

### Examples

- Dale Carnegie was reprimanded by a policeman for not having his dog on a leash, and while Dale demurred about what the harm would be, the policeman became more aggressive. The next time he saw the policeman and still didn’t have his dog on a leash, he admitted, “I’m guilty. I have no excuses. You warned me that if I did this again you would fine me.” The policeman softened - already having his importance acknowledged, he could show his importance further only by showing mercy.
