## Chapter 8: Principle 2—Commitment Is Key

You have accepted personal accountability and decided to make positive choices to achieve your vision of your life. Now, you have to follow through because intent without action is worthless. **The most important aspect of positive execution is a commitment to execute. A commitment is a promise to follow through on your accountability, or a promise to perform future actions.** When you commit to your work in business and follow through, you foster trust, respect, and greater productivity. When you commit to your actions in your personal life and follow through, you foster discipline, confidence, and self-respect.

The simple act of committing to your plans is life-changing. Your sense of self and success grows the more you continue to show up and do the work. But it’s too easy to break our promises when situations become difficult. If you only do what you say you'll do when things are easy, you’re not truly committing to your work or life.

The following components are required to develop a strong sense of commitment:

- You must have a **_strong desire_** to compel you to act. This is similar to the need to create a compelling vision of your future. If you’re not emotionally connected to the results of your actions, you won’t be willing to commit to them, especially when you hit a rough patch.
- You must know what **_keystone actions_** are at the heart of your desired outcome. There may be many ways to go about generating a certain result in business and life, but only a handful, maybe even one, will generate the most optimal results you’re capable of. Have the courage to determine the best road forward, even if it is treacherous.
- You must understand the **_costs of commitment_**. True commitment will eventually involve sacrifice. You may have less time for socializing or television, or you may have to spend money or take a pay cut to achieve your goals. These sacrifices can derail your progress if you aren’t prepared for them. Weigh the costs of true commitment beforehand to determine whether you’re truly willing to give up what’s familiar and comfortable to achieve greatness.
- You must **_ignore your feelings_** and focus on keeping your promises. True commitment is hard work. You won’t always feel like putting forth the required effort to accomplish the necessary tasks, but these are the moments you must work hard to commit. **Each time you push through your negative feelings to maintain your commitments, you'll gain trust and momentum that lead to discipline.**

The benefit of the 12-week year is the reduced burden of committing to your work. It’s easier to commit to 12 weeks of working hard than it is to 12 months of unceasing labor. When the 12 weeks are over, check in with your commitment level and adjust accordingly for the next 12 weeks. This process empowers you for greater achievement and growth, and you need both to reach your future goals and full potential.

### Two Types of Commitments

Commitments are both personal and social in that you make promises to yourself and promises to others. You don’t make promises you don’t intend to keep, but too often, that’s exactly what happens. Both types of promises create emotional consequences when broken. **When you don’t follow through, you either feel like a failure or you experience a loss of integrity.**

Think about how it feels when someone doesn’t keep a promise they made to you. You stop trusting that person completely, feel hurt, and think less of them. You don’t want to feel these things about yourself or have others think them about you. When you understand the underlying ideas involved in a commitment and what to consider before making it, you can learn how to keep from breaking it.

#### Stated Intentions Versus Hidden Intentions

When you make a commitment, you’re stating that you have an intention to do something in the future. But there are two types of intentions inside each commitment: stated and hidden. Your **_stated_** intentions are like the top of the iceberg poking out of the water, which is only about 10% of the total mass. The **_hidden_** intentions are like the 90% of the iceberg below the waterline. In your life, you can call this the “waterline of consciousness.”

You’re fully aware of your stated intentions. You intend to lose weight, you intend to make extra sales calls, or you intend to take your spouse on their dream vacation. But these stated intentions are in conflict with the hidden intentions. Under the surface, your subconscious has other intentions, such as not wanting to give up pizza or leisure time for diet food and exercise, not wanting to work late or be too exhausted to enjoy the weekend, or not wanting to spend a lot of money or take the time off of work to travel. **These hidden intentions conflict with your stated ones, and because you’re unaware of them and their power, they often win the battle and keep you from following through.**

To successfully keep your promises, you must become aware of the corresponding hidden intentions for each stated intention you make. You can often discover your hidden intentions by looking at the costs associated with the promised action. Only when your stated intention is greater than your hidden ones will you be able to reconcile the conflict in your favor.

#### Implicit Versus Explicit Commitments

All commitments you make to yourself are explicit. You understand the circumstances and your thoughts, so you’re fully aware of the agreement you’re making. But between you and another person, there are explicit and implicit commitments.

Explicit commitments are those spoken to another, what is often called “giving your word” to someone. Implicit commitments are assumed actions based on what is expected from specific relationships: a parent’s love, a partner’s fidelity, or a leader’s guidance and support. **Most issues that arise in relationships are because trust or hearts have been broken due to a failure to uphold either explicit or implicit promises.**

The following strategies are ways to ensure you keep your promises to others:

- **Put stock in your word.** If you want people to believe in your word, you must respect your word. When your integrity is important to you, you are more likely to do what is needed to maintain it.
- **Evaluate the costs.** Before promising someone something, take a moment to determine if the sacrifices required are worth it and doable. If you make a promise and discover the costs are too great, let the person know so a new solution can be found before you break your promise.
- **Commit to following through.** Like personal promises, your feelings will often get in the way of your keeping your promises to others. Commit to acting on your word, not your feelings, to always follow through.

You’re always allowed to say no when someone asks you to commit to something. **You may be afraid of disappointing people or letting them down, but those feelings are less significant after a “no” than they are after a broken promise.** Train your mind to evaluate the costs of each promise before you make it. If the costs are too great, renegotiate or say no.

Also be aware of your psychological excuses for not keeping your commitments. There’s a difference between finding excuses for why you can’t follow through and trying your best to attempt to follow through but falling short. Don’t tell yourself the action is too hard or unlikely to make a difference. The act of trying is often more important than the result. Commit to trying your best to keep your word. Even if you don’t succeed, you know you still acted with integrity.

Every time you make your best effort to do something, you build faith in yourself and confidence that you will always work hard to keep your promises. That trust will motivate you when keeping promises feels like a struggle or too large to manage.

#### Common Errors

Avoid these common errors regarding commitments:

- You break one promise and decide you are incapable of committing.
- You aren’t willing to acknowledge when you’ve broken a commitment.
- You throw your word around without respecting what it means.
- You overcommit and are unable to follow through on everything you’ve promised.
- You keep your promises a secret so you don’t have to be accountable.
- You try to go it alone instead of asking for help when you need it.
