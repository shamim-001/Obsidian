## 1971

A groundbreaking year for Phil Knight and Blue Ribbon.

Kitami visits in March, and Phil wants to wow him, make him fall in love with Oregon and Blue Ribbon. They drive him around the Pacific Northwest, feeding them salmon and wine.

But Kitami causes trouble. At First National Bank, he demands that they give Blue Ribbon more money, to everyone else’s chagrin. Then, at Blue Ribbon, he insults the company by saying doubling isn’t enough - sales should be _tripling_ every year. He shoots down Phil’s Japanese trading company idea, fearing that these companies make investments only to research companies, learn their trade secrets, and compete directly with them.

While Kitami’s in the bathroom, Phil steals a folder from Kitami’s briefcase. Their suspicions are confirmed – it lists 18 athletic shoe distributors in the US, and appointments with half of them. Phil feels betrayed – they’d revolutionized Onitsuka, shown them how to make a better shoe, and now Onitsuka was planning to cut them out.

Kitami’s trip ends with dinner at Bowerman’s house. Penny, Phil’s wife, is driving Kitami. They get a flat tire on the road, and Kitami stays in the car and doesn’t help – Penny has to fix it herself.

As betrayed as Phil feels, he believes then that the best course is to keep the peace, to convince Kitami not to abandon Blue Ribbon. Without Onitsuka and their shoes, he wouldn’t know what to do.

Kitami leaves Portland to travel around the US, but he doesn’t reveal his intentions. When he returns, he has a new solution – sell Onitsuka 51% of Blue Ribbon. It’s an ultimatum – accept the deal, or Onitsuka will set up new distributors. Phil is shocked, and he tries to stall by saying he needs to talk with Bowerman.

In a moment of clarity, Phil realizes a few things:

- Onitsuka and Kitami cannot be trusted.
- Blue Ribbon and Onitsuka are definitely going to sever ties.
- But they need to stay together as long as it takes to develop other supply sources.
- Step 1: scare off other distributors Onitsuka is meeting with by sending threats to sue.
- Step 2: find a replacement for Onitsuka.

### The Start of Nike

He remembers a shoe factory in Guadalajara, Mexico, where Adidas had manufactured shoes. Phil visits and, impressed, places an order for 3,000 pairs of leather football shoes. Technically, he knows this isn’t a violation, since his Onitsuka contract only concerns running shoes. But he feels Onitsuka had already broken the spirit of their deal.

For the shoes manufactured in Mexico, he needs a logo and a company name. Carolyn Davidson, the college designer who helps periodically with marketing materials, comes up with the swoosh idea after multiple rounds of trials. They pay her $35. Blue Ribbon agrees it looks new, fresh, and timeless, but Phil doesn’t love it.

Then they need to come up with a name. Phil proposes Dimension Six, which everyone hates. Others propose animal names, like Bengal or Falcon. Johnson has a flash of inspiration and proposes Nike. It has good properties – iconic brands are usually short and often have a strong sound, like Clorox, Kleenex. And Nike is the goddess of victory. So they move forward with their new name and logo.

(Shortform note: To Phil’s credit, he’s honest in the book about not being the originator of these ideas, nor falling in love with them at first sight. It’s common for business titans to present themselves as unconquerable geniuses in growing their company, which is why this book is refreshing.)

Unfortunately, the shoe manufactured in Mexico is disappointing. In cold weather, the sole splits and cracks.

To compound problems, First National has reached the end of its line. They will issue no more letters of credit. When they pay off the remaining bills, Blue Ribbon’s account will be terminated. After getting rejected a few times, Phil gets a small line of credit from Bank of California.

But he needs more money, from a partner that understands growth. They now have $1.3 million in sales (continuing to double each year) and he’s still having trouble keeping his company afloat. Nissho, the Japanese trading company, comes to the rescue through its representative Tom Sumeragi. He says that Nissho is willing to make loans to Blue Ribbon. Nissho itself had gone to Onitsuka to convince them to allow the deal, but Onitsuka had refused. Nissho was embarrassed by the rejection, a $100 billion company being rejected by a $25 million company, and that spurred their help.

They seal a 4% revenue share agreement, and Nissho introduces Blue Ribbon to shoe manufacturers and genuine “shoe dogs,” people who devote themselves wholly to the making and selling of shoes. Sound crazy to care so much about shoes? **Shoe dogs see crafting shoes as connecting to humanity, being the connection between a person and the earth.**

Phil Knight and Sumeragi meet with factories in Japan. They visit a factory called Nippon Rubber, part of Bridgestone Tire. Knight shows them the Cortez in the morning, and after lunch they present a brand-new manufactured Cortez, Nike stripe and all. Confident, Phil describes shoes for a range of sports, including tennis, basketball, and running shoes. Within a few days, he gets samples – they’re not perfect, but they’re very good.

In a late-night creative session, Phil decides to name the shoes – the tennis shoe is Wimbledon. The basketball shoes are Blazer and Bruin. Running shoes are Cortez, Marathon, Obori, Boston, Finland, and Wet-flyte. Finally, he feels proud and free, a bona fide creator.

He’d been in Japan for 3 weeks, and he needs some more time to visit Onitsuka, who might get suspicious if they knew he had been in Japan for this long. Penny flies over and has a panic attack from the turbulent flight and the chaos and crowdedness of Japan.

He visits Onitsuka in Kobe and meets with Kitami, Fujimoto (his ally) and Mr. Onitsuka. They take tours of Kobe and have dinner together. But the offer for Onitsuka to buy out Blue Ribbon is still on the table, so Phil feels a mild tension in the air.

He returns to Portland and meets with Bowerman. They comment that the outer sole of the training shoe hadn’t changed in 50 years – still waves or grooves across bottom. Bowerman thinks about how he created a new track surface out of polyurethane, just like in the Olympics.

Bowerman, inspired, sees his wife’s waffle iron and thinks about the gridded pattern. He takes urethane and melts it, and it seals shut, now useless. He’d forgotten to add releasing agents to the rubber. He keeps trying and eventually succeeds with the help of a rubber company. He sews the insoles to the bottom of running shoes, and it’s a breakthrough.
