## Chapter 10: Starting Your First 12 Weeks

Your first 12-week year is the most important one you’ll have. **You should not only consider it your first opportunity to grow in your life and career but also as a learning experience to set up your next 12-week year and all those that follow.** The disciplines and principles you’ve learned are all that are required for you to get started with your first 12 weeks of goal achievement. But before you can have a successful first 12 weeks, you should get clear on the barriers that will try to thwart your progress. When you know what barriers to look out for, you'll more successfully maneuver around them and increase your chance for success.

### Barriers to Success

##### 1. Resistance.

Change is hard, and you’re hardwired to resist it. Resistance to change and the effort required is akin to the monster hiding under your bed as a child. When you ignore it because you’re too afraid to confront it, the power of that monster grows. But when you turn on the lights and expose the underside of your bed, you see that the monster is not as big as you thought or not there at all. **Learn to face your fears in the light of day so they don’t grow to exponential proportions and paralyze your progress.**

##### 2. Instant Gratification

You are also hardwired to choose the road most taken, or the easiest, most comfortable way of getting somewhere. Why climb the mountain when you can take the tram to the top? But **when you skip the more challenging journey, you miss out on opportunities for growth and to prove what you’re made of**. Don’t short-change your growth by choosing immediate results over long-term benefits. The recommendation of setting a clear compelling vision is the key to overcoming this barrier. When you feel yourself choosing the easy route, your vision is what helps you understand the effort required to reach it so you can move through the discomfort.

##### 3. Too Many Goals

Studies show that the advantages gained in planning your strategy to reach your goal are weakened when there are too many strategies to manage. You will encounter too many obstacles, a lack of time, and an abundance of costs when you try to change several things at once. One goal that may seem hard but achievable on its own is suddenly drowning in a sea of debris from all the other goals. And if your goal or actions feel too big, you won’t attempt them. The beauty of the strategic block is that you focus on one thing at a time. This reduces the magnitude of the task, which makes it feel more manageable and keeps you motivated. **Make your actions small and the measure of success achievable so you'll feel confident each time you accomplish them.**

##### 4. Business As Usual

Your old life will still surround you as you try to reshape your behaviors for success. Your old triggers will still be there to challenge the power of your new triggers. And because the old triggers are familiar and comfortable, you easily fall back into your old ways. One way to thwart this is to use old triggers to activate new triggers, rather than trying to replace them. For instance, if you always read the news while drinking coffee, make coffee time your buffer block. **When you incorporate your new system into the confines of your life, you align your new behaviors in a natural way.** This reduces the conflict with your old environment and makes you more likely to follow through.

### Steps for Creating Your First 12-Week Plan

You have received all of this information already, but having the steps reiterated will help you remember them in sequence and their significance.

**Step 1:** Create your compelling vision and connect emotionally with it.

**Step 2:** Set your first short-term (three-year) goal toward achieving that long-term vision.

**Step 3:** Determine the steps involved in reaching that short-term goal.

**Step 4:** Build a 12-week plan for accomplishing those steps.

**Step 5:** Build a model week for how you will achieve the necessary tasks.

**Step 6:** Use the first day of each week to measure your progress and plan the coming week.

**Step 7:** Follow through.

Steps 1 through 4 should happen before the 12 weeks begin. When you're fully organized, that’s when you start your 12-week journey.

Your first four weeks will be all about building the habit of following your plan. Focus on the fundamentals of the 12-week year, and follow them to the letter. How you move through these first four weeks will determine the success of the other eight weeks to come. **This month is when you want to hone your execution skills and manage your barriers.**

The second four weeks will lack urgency, so staying motivated and committed is vital in the second month. Your routine is already established, and the ending is still a ways off. But at this point, you have some good measures of your lead and lag indicators and can use them to determine what’s working and what isn’t. These weeks are when you want to make significant adjustments to either your plan or execution so you can finish strong.

The last four weeks are when you start to see the results of your work. You may not be exactly where you want to be, but the fact that you’ve made it this far is a measure of success if you’ve been hitting a score of at least 85% a majority of the time. You’ve created new ways of thinking and approaching your work, and **you have what you need to learn from this experience and increase your efforts for the next 12 weeks**.

### The 13th Week

Even if you didn’t hit your intended goal completely, chances are you made significant progress and have experienced some of the personal and professional benefits of your new system. The week after the 12-week plan ends can be used to finish up any loose ends to help reach the full goal. You can also use it as a period of reflection to assess your satisfaction with the process and your efforts. Finally, **you should definitely use part of the 13th week to acknowledge your achievements, big or small, and celebrate**.

If you’re in business, the 13th week is a good time for an action-review meeting to look over the separate efforts made by your employees that contributed to the overall goal. Use this review to begin planning your next 12 weeks using the information about what worked and what didn’t.

Whether in business or in your personal life, use the end of the 13th week to set a new goal for a brand new Week 1, and write your action plan. **As you accumulate more 12-week periods of success, you'll be surprised by how much you’ve accomplished and how close your vision is to becoming a reality.** You can start living your full potential the moment you choose to implement this process. Don’t wait for the perfect time. Choose to be great now.
