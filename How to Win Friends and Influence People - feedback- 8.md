## Feedback 8: Keep the Person’s Interests in Mind

### Principles

- Always keep the other person’s interests and incentives in mind. Link your suggestion with meeting their interests.
- **Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants. Then consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest**.

### Tactics

- When rejecting someone for a responsibility, intimate that they’re too important for the role.
- If turning down a social event or invitation to speak, offer up an alternative - a substitute speaker, another time to meet. The rejected party won’t have any time to feel disappointed.
- Make people feel important with new responsibilities, job titles.

### Examples

- When President Wilson appointed one diplomat over another to Europe to discuss WWI, the appointed diplomat broke the news to the rejected one: “It would be unwise for anyone to do this officially, and your going would attract a great deal of attention and people would wonder why you were there.” He appealed to the rejected diplomat’s importance, suggesting the rejected diplomat was more important than he was.
- A father assigned his son the chore of picking up fruit under a tree, which the son didn’t like. He made an offer: “for every bushel you gather, I’ll give you a dollar. But for every fruit I find not picked up, I’ll take away a dollar. How does that sound?”
- Napoleon created the Legion of Honour and gave 15,000 crosses to his soldiers, named his generals “Marshals of France,” and called his army “The Grand Army.” When criticized for giving toys to veterans, he said, “Men are ruled by toys.”
- A store manager had to clean the stockroom. He approached the employee:
    - Bad approach: “We need the stock room cleaned out for our visitors. Please put the room in order and polish the counter.”
    - Good approach: “We have a job that needs to be done right away. If we do it now, we won’t need to do it later. We have customers coming in, and I’d like to show them the room, but it’s in disarray. If you put it in order and polish the counter, it’ll make us look professional, and you’ll have done your part to show our company well.”
    - The latter approach appeals to the person’s pride in managing the stockroom appearance, and it points out the benefit of not having to do it later.
