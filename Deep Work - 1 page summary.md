## 1-Page Summary

**Cal Newport defines “deep work” as focused, uninterrupted, _undistracted_ work on a task that pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit**. In contrast, “shallow work” describes tasks that aren’t as cognitively demanding—like answering emails and attending unproductive meetings. These tasks don’t create much value and anyone can do them.

(Shortform note: Some of Newport’s contemporaries refer to deep work and shallow work [as reflective work and reactive work](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/shortform-exclusive). However, regarding some tasks, the boundary between “reflective” and “reactive” can be confusing. For example, you may think that because emails require you to _reflect_ on an adequate response, they count as _reflective_ work—though they’re shallow work, by Newport’s definition.)

Over the past decades, the economy has moved away from brute force labor to analyzing and applying information. Newport explains that skills that succeed in the modern economy—like complex problem solving, data analysis, and computer programming—require deep work to learn and execute. **He argues that your ability to do deep work will determine how much you thrive in the information economy.** Ironically, the same technologies that _built_ the information economy are _depleting_ our ability to do deep work. Phones, emails, and addictive apps pull us away every few minutes. Thus, at a time when deep work is most important, it’s also most difficult.

(Shortform note: These ideas aren’t new—Peter Drucker’s _[The Effective Executive](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive)_, published in 1966, discusses the rising “knowledge economy.” Drucker’s best practices for standing out in the knowledge economy align closely with several deep work practices we’ll explore later in this guide, such as cutting out time-wasting activities, scheduling tasks into uninterrupted blocks of time, and focusing on one task at a time.)

This guide is divided into two parts. First, we’ll cover the three foundational ideas of deep work and learn about its benefits. Then, we’ll explore practices that will help you create a supportive environment for engaging in deep work.

### Idea #1: Deep Work Is _Important_

Newport argues that deep work allows you to do two things critical to your performance in the information economy:

1. **Learn and master new skills:** Newport explains that technology and best practices become obsolete quickly in the information economy. In order to stay relevant over decades, you must continue to learn challenging new skills—which requires focus. (Shortform note: Experts have [[pinpointed several actions that usually lead to skill ]]: First, determine if your goal is attainable and ensure that the skill is relevant to your career. Then, find a method that aligns with your learning style and allows you to take on the skill bit by bit, instead of all at once. Finally, rely on others—find a mentor who can coach you and help you reflect on your progress.)
2. **Apply the skills to increase your output:** Once you’ve learned a skill, you need to do something useful with it. Consider the simple rule: _High-quality work produced = Time Spent x Intensity of Focus._ (Shortform note: The key here is that what you do with your skill must be _useful_. In _[The Effective Executive](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/introduction)_, Peter Drucker explains how to determine if your work is _effective_—useful work that improves your performance and comes with application of Newport’s rule—or just _efficient_—productivity for the sake of increasing output that’s not necessarily useful or high-quality.)

### Idea #2: Deep Work Is _Difficult_

Newport explains that deep work is difficult because our world bombards us with near-constant distractions. **He outlines three major ways that modern workplaces derail workers’ ability to engage in deep work.**

1. **Open floor plans:** Open floor plans were meant to increase collaboration. But Newport explains that they're a continuously distracting environment, where every conversation is heard, and one person can disrupt dozens of people. (Shortform note: Before the Covid-19 pandemic, [many companies were already starting to rethink their open floor plans, finding that putting so many employees in a shared space was creating too much distraction](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/will-coronavirus-end-the-open-office-floor-plan). For these companies, the pandemic highlighted the heightened risk of disease transmission in open shared spaces and accelerated their decision to leave open floor plans behind.)
2. **Instant communication:** With instant-messaging tools like Slack and texting, people can interrupt your work on-demand. According to Newport, as a result of this, we stop being deep thinkers and become human network routers. (Shortform note: We’ll look at actionable steps to make instant messaging less distracting in the section on building your deep work environment, for instance using the platform’s features to notify senders that you won’t be responding immediately.)
3. **Social media:** On social media platforms, conversations continue endlessly, 24/7. The new content you see always seems novel and productive, but it doesn’t move you closer to the major things you really care about. (Shortform note: The addictive quality of social media is due to our attraction to _[variable rewards](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201311/use-unpredictable-rewards-keep-behavior-going)_: rewards that happen at random times, rather than in a predictable pattern. You can’t predict which refresh of your newsfeed will reward you with interesting information or likes, so the action never loses its appeal.)

### Idea #3: Deep Work Is Fulfilling

Shallow work is deceptively bad because it _feels_ productive and meaningful. Answering emails feels like you’re doing something. Staying on top of the office conversation in Slack makes you feel updated on what’s going on. In contrast, **Newport says, deep work _actually_ moves you meaningfully toward happiness and fulfillment.** Deep work is when you’re most capable of tackling your thorniest problems. Because these problems often yield the largest rewards, deep work is often far more rewarding than shallow work.

(Shortform note: Newport mentions in an interview that [he didn’t originally intend to include a chapter on the fulfilling aspect of deep work](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/539094544). However, as his research went on, he found so many accounts of people whose deep work practices led to a deeper sense of happiness and fulfillment in their work, he felt that he needed to include it.)

Newport explains that the fulfillment that comes from doing deep work aligns closely with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s ideas on “flow.” Csikszentmihalyi, psychologist and author of _[Flow](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/flow)_, found that when people concentrate on a worthwhile task that pushes them to their cognitive limit, they experience a state of flow, or a sense of contentment and purpose.

(Shortform note: Because flow [occurs when you’re working hard at something you believe is important](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/flow/chapter-1), it naturally would be more likely to happen when you’re doing deep work in support of your goals than when you’re scrolling through Reddit comments.)

### Practice #1: Plan Out Time for Deep Work

After establishing what deep work is and why it’s important, Newport moves on to explain different ways to make deep work practices part of your life. The first step is carving out time that you’ll dedicate to deep work. He warns that it’s difficult to simply _will_ yourself to do deep work on demand. **It’s more effective to approach deep work with structure, habit, and discipline—in other words, to make deep work a _practiced ritual_.**

#### The Four Types of Deep Work Scheduling

**If you make deep work a ritual or habit, you no longer have to employ your willpower to overcome distraction.** Newport says it’s most effective to set time aside specifically for focusing on deep work. To be successful at doing deep work in the long term, you’ll have to try out different schedules to see what best fits your lifestyle and needs. Newport offers four types of deep work schedules for consideration, each with different time requirements and efficacy.

##### Schedule Type 1: Seclusion

Remove as many shallow work tasks from your life as possible. Spend nearly all your time on deep work.

- Example: Some authors go off the grid and aren’t reachable by email or through social media. All correspondence comes in by postal mail or through their editor.

The advantage of this schedule is that you get extended periods of deep work—it becomes your default working style, not something you have to plan for. However, this isn’t feasible for most people, given the requirements of their careers.

(Shortform note: This schedule requires you to avoid all shallow tasks, though often these tasks are a necessary part of life. To handle this, you’ll have to learn the essential skill of _delegation_. In _[Who Not How](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/652066/who-not-how-by-dan-sullivan-and-dr-benjamin-hardy/),_ Dan Sullivan explains that successful delegation depends on finding the best person for the job, instead of finding the best way to do the job. Instead of asking, “_How_ can I get my shallow work done with this kind of schedule?” ask, “_Who_ can I delegate my shallow work to?”)

##### Schedule Type 2: Periodic

Carve out regular periods each week, month, or entire parts of the year to focus on deep work. The book stresses that the period should be **at least one full day** to reach the maximum intensity of deep work. (As we’ll see in the following schedule suggestion, it’s possible to do a few daily hours of deep work, but those few hours won’t be at the intensity you would achieve in a full day of deep work.)

- Example: You might carve out a three-day block of the week where you aren’t contactable while preserving the other two days for shallower work.

The advantage of this schedule is that it’s more realistic than the seclusion schedule. Setting aside at least one full day of deep work helps you reach your maximum level of focus. However, despite being more realistic, it’s still impractical for many workers, who have to perform certain tasks daily.

(Shortform note: Even if you’re a 9-5 office worker, it may be possible to adopt a periodic schedule—especially as companies normalize remote work. In _[The Effective Executive](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-effective-executive/practice-1)_, Peter Drucker recommends working from home at least one day per week, and planning to do your most mentally demanding tasks in this isolated, focused time.)

##### Schedule Type 3: Daily

Set aside a regular block of time each day to focus on deep work.

- Example: Set aside the morning (such as 8 to 11 a.m.) for deep work, before jumping into shallow work.

The regularity of this schedule is conducive to forming a habit, and it’s realistic for many careers and lifestyles. However, this schedule doesn’t give the full day of deep work that the seclusion or periodic schedules can provide, and therefore you won’t reach your _maximum_ focus potential.

(Shortform note: In _[The 5 AM Club](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-am-club),_ Robin Sharma notes that the most productive part of your day is the hour right after you wake up because you’re recharged and the world is relatively quiet and distraction-free. It therefore makes sense to try to schedule your deep work time block in the early morning.)

##### Schedule Type 4: Ad Hoc

Find some time to do deep work whenever you can get it.

- Example: When on a trip with your family, carve out a few hours to do work before joining them for activities.

This is the most flexible schedule. You can do deep work at any point when it’s possible. But, because it’s irregular, it’s the least successful in setting up a habit. It requires the ability to switch on deep work instantaneously.

(Shortform note: It’s difficult to successfully achieve a level of deep work on the ad hoc schedule unless you’ve trained your ability to switch your “deep work brain” on and off at will—like a journalist, for example—or if you’re strongly driven by the belief that your work matters and that you’ll succeed. In his book _[So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/1-page-summary),_ Newport elaborates on _why_ having a strong sense of purpose is essential to doing your best work at an exceptional performance level.)

##### How Much Deep Work Should You Try to Fit Into Your Day?

Newport cautions that there _is_ a limit to how much deep work you’ll be able to accomplish per day. Anders Ericsson, author of _[Peak](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/peak)_, explains that most novices can only accomplish about an hour a day of intense concentration. **Experts who have extensive practice can expand to up to four hours, but rarely are able to exceed this**.

(Shortform note: Newport doesn’t discuss circumstances under which people can—and do—concentrate deeply for more than four hours at a time, [such as chess grandmasters](https://thechessworld.com/articles/training-techniques/how-many-hours-per-day-to-work-on-chess-according-to-gm-shipov/). Critics point out that this gives Newport a sort of loophole: If someone claims that they’re able to do deep work for more than four hours, he can always respond that their work must have _actually_ been shallow work.)

#### Plan Out Your Days

Newport suggests several techniques for making sure you leave yourself enough time for deep work and aren’t tempted to engage in shallow work during that time.

##### Technique #1: Schedule Internet Time

**Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet. Avoid it completely outside these times.** Newport gives some tips on how to make the most of this practice:

- Keep a notepad nearby where you record the next time you’re scheduled to use the Internet, and any ideas you need to revisit once you’re online again.
- Plan your work so you don’t need the Internet to make progress. If you get stuck by not being able to access the Internet, then move on to another task. Plan better next time.
- If you do this primarily at work, then don’t stop this practice at home after work. This will undo the training you did at work.

(Shortform note: For most knowledge workers, it’s not possible to only use the Internet at certain times of the day. But if you must use the Internet all day, try using website-blocking apps like [Forest](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/forest-stay-focused-be-pr/kjacjjdnoddnpbbcjilcajfhhbdhkpgk?hl=en-GB) or [Self Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/self-control/ncaaipdfhdijmfdfmeoagmogddhkfdec?hl=en-GB) to help remove the temptation to switch your attention away from deep work.)

##### Technique #2: Plan Out Every Minute of Your Day, and Quantify Depth

Next, **plan out everything that you need to do throughout the day.** Newport says that when you set specific goals by planning out what you’ll work on in advance, you’re less likely to switch to other tasks. He outlines three steps to planning your time in a deep work-supporting way:

1. **Plan your tasks:** Think about the tasks that you need to complete and note what time you plan to complete them. Newport recommends breaking down your tasks into half-hour blocks, making sure to schedule buffer blocks to handle emergencies or tasks that run over their allotted time. (Shortform note: In 2020, Newport released _[The Time-Block Planner](https://www.timeblockplanner.com/#timeplanner)_, which helps guide readers to create schedules broken down into half-hour increments and in alignment with their goals.)
2. **Quantify depth:** He then says to estimate and note the “deep work” complexity of each task. As a rule of thumb, imagine how long it would take to train a smart college grad to do the task—the more time, the deeper the work. (Shortform note: This heuristic doesn’t always work if you’ve built up a skill to the point that it’s routine. For instance, a surgeon operating may not consider a certain procedure deep work.) Once you’ve finished quantifying the depth of your day’s tasks, look over your schedule. If your day is full of shallow tasks, Newport urges you to consider how you can replace those with deeper work.
3. **Reflect on and tweak your schedule:** Newport suggests reviewing the accuracy of your time blocks at the end of each day. This will help you set more accurate goals and expectations in the future. (Shortform note: You may feel discouraged if you aren’t able to follow your schedule or give in to distraction. Nir Eyal addresses this feeling in _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-2)_—he explains that it’s essential to think of your schedule as an evolving experiment that you probably won’t get right on the first try. Instead of stressing out, think of ways to build a schedule better aligned with your needs.)

##### Technique #3: Set Ambitious Deadlines

**Give yourself intense deadlines that will force you to concentrate at the limit of your ability.** Newport recommends estimating how long you’d normally schedule for the task. **Then cut down the time drastically**, and set it as your deadline.

(Shortform note: Intense deadlines not only force you into focus mode but can actually make your work _better_. When you set an ambitious deadline, you create a moderate amount of emotional arousal—which, [according to the Yerkes-Dodson Law, is where you achieve peak performance](https://www.healthline.com/health/yerkes-dodson-law). In other words, people really do “work best under pressure.”)

### Practice #2: Build Your Deep Work Environment

In addition to scheduling time for deep work, Newport encourages you to build an environment that supports deep work by reducing distraction triggers.

#### Step 1: Create a Deep-Work-Only Environment

**Newport suggests designating a deep work space, where you go _only_ to do deep work** (like a conference room, the library, or an office in your home). Compartmentalizing your location this way will cement the habit of deep work more strongly.

(Shortform note: In _[Atomic Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits/part-ii)_, James Clear discusses the power of using environmental cues to trigger desirable behaviors. Try adding environmental cues to your space—for example, lighting a specific candle each time you start working. Over time, your brain will associate these cues with deep work, and you’ll more easily enter a focused state of mind.)

#### Step 2: Get Rid of Distractions

Newport points out that a key to spending more time in deep work is to avoid distractions that take you out of deep work.

(Shortform note: You may think that it’s not necessary to _cut out_ potential distractions, instead opting for simple management techniques like placing your phone face down to avoid looking at notifications. However, studies show that [when working on the computer, people become distracted, on average, every 40 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%20wo=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y). Even if your phone is face down on your desk, it’s still an available distraction to reach for.)

##### Floorplans

Newport argues that the ideal office floor plan is the “hub and spoke” model, in which central hubs—such as meeting rooms, break areas, and cafeterias—allow for communal work and serendipitous meetings and branch off into spokes that lead to quiet, private places for people to do deep work.

(Shortform note: While Newport suggests this model as a solution to the trend of open floor plans, he doesn’t give any type of workaround for those who have no control over the layout of their workspace. In _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-3-1)_, Nir Eyal suggests that workers who may find themselves in a distracting workspace can try creating visual cues to show others that they need to be left alone. This may look like a certain hat you wear when you’re in deep work mode or a small “Do not interrupt” sign on top of your monitor.)

##### Social Media

**Newport says that social media is insidious in that it seems like you’re doing productive things when really the gains are minor.** To begin managing the way you use tech, Newport suggests taking the following steps to examine each of your tech tools in regard to their **benefits and cost.** This will help you see which tools are worth your time and which aren’t.

1. **List your goals.** Make a list of your most important goals—professional and personal—and then list the two or three activities that help you progress most toward these goals. Newport notes that these activities should be specific enough to give you direction, but general enough to be repeatable. (Shortform note: Your goal-supporting activities _can_ include social media. For example, Newport may claim that journalists and authors on social media are wasting their time, but these days, [establishing a presence on social media is an essential part of marketing](https://heatherdemetrios.medium.com/what-a-big-5-publisher-will-tell-you-about-marketing-your-book-f47be2e12dd3) for authors trying to break into the industry.)
2. **Examine your tech tools:** For each of your major tools—for example, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit—describe how they contribute (or don’t contribute) meaningfully to your important goals. (Shortform note: To fully understand a tech tool’s effect on you and your goals, you must be honest with yourself about _why_ you’re using the tool. Research shows that [your intent in using social media determines how negatively or positively it will affect your well-being](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417730833)—those who use social media to check out what others are up to develop negative well-being due to constant comparison, while those who use social media to chat with their friends develop positive well-being due to strengthened social bonds.)
3. **Try quitting:** If you’re on the fence about how much you need a tool, do an experiment: Quit for 30 days and see what happens. Afterward, consider whether your life would have been notably better if you had been able to use that tool. (Shortform note: Breaking out of the dopamine cycle of social media is easier said than done. There will be an adjustment period: Research shows that [it takes about eight days for your brain to calm down and become accustomed to a lower level of stimulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y).)

##### Emails

Newport contends that emails are an insidious time suck, both for senders and recipients. He says many people use emails unthinkingly or as a quick way to toss responsibilities into someone else’s court. Newport suggests several ways to reduce the time you spend on the shallow work of unproductive emails.

**1) Make sure your emails contain _all_ essential information.** Newport explains that when replying to an email, you should articulate: 1) the current state of things, 2) what the ultimate goal is, and 3) what the most effective next steps are. He says this prevents unproductive email volleys and closes the mental loop for you, preventing mental residue from accumulating.

- For example, a bad reply would be, “Yes, let’s meet for lunch. When works for you?” A better reply is, “Here are times over the next week when I’m available. If any of these work for you, let me know, and please send a calendar invite. If none of these work, please send over a few times that do.”

(Shortform note: Newport takes the idea of closing the “mental loop” from David Allen’s _[Getting Things Done](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done)_ system. When you fail to clearly define and delegate the next steps (no matter how big or small a project), you keep too many thoughts and unanswered questions on your plate and can feel scattered or unfocused. On the other hand, sending out emails that ask recipients for clearly defined actions lets you mentally put the project aside until the action is performed.)

**2) Publish your email policy, and respond—or don’t—accordingly.** Make sure people who are interested in contacting you know how you’ll handle incoming emails, and which emails you’ll reject. Newport suggests a clear message such as, “Please only contact me via email if you have a speaking engagement, collaboration, or introduction that you think I may be interested in. Please know that I may not reply unless it’s a good fit for my schedule and interests.”

(Shortform note: Newport’s practices aren’t “one size fits all.” While they might work for _some_ knowledge workers—professors, authors like Newport—most knowledge workers aren’t in a position to tell others what they will and won’t respond to. You can, however, [simply slow down your response times](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-3-1), as suggested by Nir Eyal. He explains that humans have an innate need to imitate one another—if you reply quickly to a colleague, they’ll reply quickly to you. Consciously slowing down this exchange means you’ll receive fewer emails, and the emails you _do_ get will be more thoughtful—by taking the pressure of a quick response off the other party, you allow them time to think through their response.)

### Practice #3: Train Your Focus

As discussed, most beginners can only do about an hour of deep work at a time, but you can train your brain to focus for longer and longer stretches. Newport offers several techniques for this.

#### 1) Let Boredom Happen

Newport points out that most people, in idle moments like waiting in line, reflexively pull out their phones for a quick scroll through social media or their texts. He says that by always filling in these low-stimuli moments with a high-stimuli activity, you deplete your brain’s ability to tolerate boredom—even if you set aside time for deep work, you won’t be able to _do_ the work during that time unless you strengthen your brain’s “focus muscles.” He suggests consciously letting yourself be bored in low-stimuli moments.

- For example, if you’re waiting outside of a bar for your friend, consciously resist taking your phone out. Instead, just sit still and take in whatever’s going on around you.

(Shortform note: Comedian Bo Burnham explores our toxic dependency on the Internet’s endless dopamine supply and entertainment in his song, _[Welcome to the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU)_. He describes the Internet as “a little bit of everything, all of the time'' that we’ve become addicted to by design, resulting in a world in which “boredom is a crime.” Warning: Crude language.)

#### 2) Define Metrics of Success

Newport suggests creating a clear metric by which you can define the success of your deep work practices. This practice helps keep you focused on _doing_ your work rather than on what you should be doing with your time or wondering if your results are “enough.”

- For example, you might set a goal to write 500 words every 30 minutes—this way, your task is straightforward and you naturally get two simple progress checks per hour.

(Shortform note: In _[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/parts-7-8)_, Dale Carnegie says that setting small goals or challenges makes work a bit like an enjoyable game and prevents you from becoming bored or zoning out. For example, if you’re coming up on 30 minutes with only 400 words written, you’ll likely find finishing those last 100 words an interesting challenge.)

### Practice #4: Make the Most of Your Focused Time

Once you have the schedule and the environment, you must actually _do_ deep work. Newport offers several suggestions to make the most of your focused time.

#### The 4 Disciplines of Execution

Newport outlines four principles of deep work that come from the book _[The 4 Disciplines of Execution](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-4-disciplines-of-execution/1-page-summary)_. During deep work sessions, use these principles to optimize your time and focus on the right things.

**1) Focus on what’s important.** When choosing what to work on, figure out what things have the largest impact. Then, instead of trying to say no to trivial distractions, **simply say yes to the most important task or goal.** This process helps crowd out shallow tasks that don’t support your goals.

(Shortform note: In _[Built to Last](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/built-to-last/chapter-5)_, Jim Collins outlines steps to creating “big, hairy, audacious goals,” or BHAGs—he urges you to create goals that are clear, push you outside your comfort zone, and are aligned closely with your core values.)

**2) Use the right metrics.** The most useful metrics in deep work are _leading_ metrics, or metrics you can use in real-time to tweak what your result will be. For example, Newport suggests leading metrics like the number of pages you’ve written or the number of new ideas you’ve generated. These give real-time feedback that helps you see how effective you are at deep work. In contrast, a _lagging_ metric would be how many papers you’ve published at the end of 2021—at that point, you can’t go back and change your behavior in order to publish more papers in the year.

(Shortform note: The authors of _[The 4 Disciplines of Execution](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-4-disciplines-of-execution/defining-discipline-2)_ warn that leading metrics are more difficult to measure than lagging metrics (for example, it’s easier to measure how much you weigh—a lagging metric—than it is to measure how many calories you’re eating—a leading metric). You’ll have to make a habit of collecting data on your leading metrics.)

**3) Keep your metrics visible.** Making your leading metrics visible will motivate you to keep up the habit and allow for more frequent celebration of successes. Newport suggests keeping a physical display in the workspace that shows your leading metric, like a small whiteboard where you mark off hours spent in deep work.

(Shortform note: Studies show that [continuously celebrating small achievements and feeling a sense of progress is a fairly easy way to boost your overall happiness](https://hbr.org/2011/05/small-wins-and-feeling-good#:~:text=it%20into%20molehills.-,In%20his%20classic%20paper%2C%20%E2%80%9CSmall%20Wins%2C%E2%80%9D%20University%20of,ones%20with%20concrete%20achievable%20goals.&text=This%20strategy%20propels%20long%2Dterm%20goal%20achievement)—this is important because the strongest indicator of productivity is the way you _feel._ Research reveals that when you feel [positively toward your work, your productive performance naturally increases](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins).)

**4) Create accountability where possible.** Periodically analyzing your deep work will keep you honest about how well you lived up to your goals. Newport explains that this exercise will show you where you can improve. He suggests setting up a weekly review to see what you’ve achieved in the past week and make a plan for the coming week. If you’ve had a negative week, make changes to your schedule to cut out factors that led to it.

(Shortform note: If you struggle with making behavioral changes based on a review of your own behaviors, you might try adding a more social aspect to your accountability practices. In _Indistractable,_ [Nir Eyal recommends social precommitments](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-4), which make it harder for you to perform undesirable behaviors. For example, you might make a precommitment to have someone else review each week’s deep work report. You’re more likely to stay away from shallow work and focus on hitting your goals because of the added pressure of being “watched” by someone else.)

#### Learn to Say No to Shallow Work

Newport warns that like most knowledge workers, you’ll face invitations to partake in various forms of shallow work, such as meetings, committees, and travel. He suggests saying no to this shallow work by **providing a vague enough response that the requester cannot find a loophole that they could use to get you to say yes.** For example, you might say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it because of schedule conflicts,” or, “Thank you for inviting me, but I won’t be able to make it.”

(Shortform note: Critics point out that in many industries, it’s important for each team member to contribute to the group—it’s unfair to expect others to take on shallow tasks while you refuse to do them. Newport’s role as a professor isn’t an exception to this expectation: [Joining committees, networking, and doing other shallow tasks are becoming increasingly vital parts of finding employment in academia](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2016/02/03/what-do-academic-employers-want/).)

#### Ritualize Your Workday Shutdown

**To fully get your mind off work and relax, Newport suggests creating a shutdown ritual.** He says this ritual should help you check your work for anything you forgot and plan your next day’s work. For example, you could check your emails for any last urgent items, update your to-do list, check your calendar for upcoming deadlines, and say, “All done,” or a similar phrase to explicitly mark the end of the workday.

(Shortform note: You may want to add reflective time into your workday shutdown—research shows that [employees who spend 15 minutes at the end of their workday reflecting on what they learned during the day perform about 23% better in their work than those who don’t take time for reflection](https://hbr.org/2017/03/why-you-should-make-time-for-self-reflection-even-if-you-hate-doing-it).)

**Newport stresses that an important benefit of the end-of-day ritual is that it helps reassure you that things will be fine when you shut down.** When you create a shutdown ritual, instead of feeling anxious about unfinished tasks, you’ll feel confident that all the important tasks are accounted for, and that you’ll make meaningful progress the next day. This gives you more time to fully relax in your time off from work. (Shortform note: This ritual also sets clear boundaries between work and not-work, [which is especially important as more knowledge workers fall into the trap of overworking when working from home](https://memory.ai/timely-blog/why-cant-we-stop-overworking).)
