## Part 3-3: The Objective View

We are often better at analyzing external situations (the “outside view”) than our own. When you look inward at yourself (the “inside view”), it’s too tempting to consider yourself exceptional— “the average rules and statistics don’t apply to me!” And even when you do get statistics, it’s easy to discard them, especially when they conflict with your personal impressions of the truth.

In general, **when you have information about an individual case, it’s tempting to believe the case is exceptional, and to disregard statistics of the class to which the case belongs**.

Here are examples of situations where people ignore base statistics and hope for the exceptional:

- 90% of drivers state they’re above average drivers. Here they don’t necessarily think about what “average” means statistically—instead, they think about whether the skill is easy for them, then intensity match to where they fit the population.
- Most people believe they are superior to most others on most desirable traits.
- When getting consultations, lawyers may refuse to comment on the projected outcome of a case, saying “every case is unique.”
- Business owners know that only 35% of new businesses survive after 5 years. Despite this, 82% of entrepreneurs put their personal odds of success at 70% or higher, and 33% said their chance of failing was zero!
    - Kahneman tells a story of meeting motel owners who said they bought the motel cheaply because “the previous owners failed to make a go of it.” They seemed blithely indifferent to the circumstances that led the previous owner to fail.
- CEOs make large, splashy mergers and acquisitions, despite research showing a poor track record of such strategies working.

#### Planning Fallacy

The **planning fallacy** is a related phenomenon where you **habitually underestimate the amount of time and resources required to finish a project**.

When estimating for a project, you tend to give “best case scenario” estimates, rather than confidence ranges. You don’t know what you don’t know about what will happen—the emergencies, loss of motivation, and obstacles that will pop up—and you don’t factor in buffer time for this.

Kahneman gives an example of a curriculum committee meeting to plan a book. They happily estimate 2 years for completion of the book. Kahneman then asks the editor how long other teams have taken. The answer is 7-10 years, with 40% of teams failing to finish at all. Kahneman then asks how their team skill compares to the other teams. The answer is Kahneman’s team is below average.

This was an astounding example of how a person may have relevant statistics in her head, but then **completely fails to recall this data as relevant for the situation**. (The book did indeed take 8 years.)

Furthermore, before Kahneman asked his questions, **the team didn’t even feel they needed information about other teams to make their guess**! They looked only at their own data situation.

Government projects have a funny pattern of being universally under budget and delayed. (Though there may be an underlying incentive at play here, since projects that are lower cost and shorter time are easier to get approved.)

#### Antidote to the Inside View

The antidote is similar to the correction for heuristics in the last section:

- Identify the appropriate category the situation belongs in.
- **Consider the population distribution for the category.** Start with this baseline prediction.
- Use specific information about the case that allows you to adjust from the baseline prediction.

Another technique is to **write a premortem**: “Imagine that it’s a year from now. We implemented the plan. It was a disaster. **Write a history of the disaster**.” The premortem has a few advantages:

- As a piece of writing, it avoids the public groupthink that arises from conversation.
- It encourages creative dissent before a project starts, which is normally suppressed when a project begins.

Finally, when evaluating how well a project was executed, reward people who finish according to their original deadlines, not those who finish much earlier or later than planned.

### On Optimism and Entrepreneurs

Optimism has a lot of advantages. Optimistic people are happier, recover from setbacks more easily, have greater self-confidence, feel healthier, and live longer. Research suggests optimism is largely genetic (though some psychologists believe it can be learned).

**Optimistic people play a disproportionate role in shaping the world**. They are the inventors, entrepreneurs, and political leaders. They take risks and seek challenges. They’re talented but are also lucky (luckier than they acknowledge). Their success confirms their faith in their judgment and their ability to control events.

As described above, most founders know the statistics—most startups fail, and the path that yields the higher expected value path is to sell their services to an employer. To forsake the latter path and start a company, you _need_ to be overoptimistic or deluded.

**One drawback to optimism is that it encourages people to take outsized risks because they overestimate their chances of success.** Data points that support this:

- Of inventors who were told their inventions were destined to fail, half ignored the advice and continued, doubling their original losses.
- More optimistic CEOs (those who own more equity in the company) take excessive risks and lower company performance, compared to CEOs who own less equity.
- Movie studios tend to release big budget movies on the same day (like July 4th) because they ignore the competition—“we’ve got a great story and marketing department, so _our_ film is going to do great.” The real question they should be asking is, “considering the market and what everyone else is doing, how many people will see our film?”
- Because of outcome bias, people who take extraordinary risks and have it work are lauded for their prescience and thus serve as a model for new entrepreneurs. All the failures are forgotten.

Despite the humbling statistics on failure, Kahneman notes that yet there is value in the legions of entrepreneurs who try and fail. They perform a market discovery service, figuring out pockets of opportunity that larger companies can later service. Many companies die as “optimistic martyrs.”

And overall, mixing high optimism with good implementation is a positive trait. It allows endurance through setbacks and belief in what one is doing.
