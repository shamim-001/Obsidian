## Chapter 2: Discipline 1—Vision

One of the most important requirements of increasing your execution is a clear and compelling vision for what you want your future to be. This vision is necessary because the process of executing at a higher level is simple but not easy. What stops so many people from doing it is the hardship of going through the steps of change. **Changing your behavior is uncomfortable because you're pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.** When this happens, your brain activates your fight-or-flight response. Unfortunately, flight is the easier choice than pushing through the discomfort to fight.

Although you’ll work within the confines of 12 weeks to achieve higher productivity, the cumulative outcome must be life-changing in the long term to keep you motivated. If you don’t have a compelling vision of your future, you won’t see the benefit of reducing your comfort level as you work toward it.

### What Is a Compelling Vision?

Your compelling vision should be of a life significantly better than your current life. Otherwise, why put in all the work if you just want to stay in the same place. Imagine a future where you have everything you want. Think about your life goals. When you consider your goals, you can get a better idea of what you want the rest of your life to look like, which helps you create a plan. **And a plan that is attached to your vision of your life is one you’re emotionally connected with.**

Emotional connection with your vision of the future is key to reaching your full potential because you’ll do what is necessary to attain a goal you care about. You’ll begin the process of optimal execution when you set this life vision because you know exactly what you need to do to get to where you want to be, and your actions will align accordingly.

You go through two modes of creation when you work toward a goal: the mental planning and the physical labor. **Get clear on your compelling vision to become clear on how to implement the necessary behaviors to realize it.**

#### The Brain and Your Emotions

A compelling vision not only helps create passion for your life and work but also changes the physiology of your brain. When you start to work toward something greater than your current state, part of your brain called the _amygdala_ activates and sends fear signals through your body. The amygdala is meant to protect you from dangers in your environment, and moving into uncomfortable territory is perceived as a danger. You will experience fear, confusion, and doubt and be triggered to abandon your efforts.

But there’s another part of the brain that activates when you create a compelling vision. This part is called the _prefrontal cortex_, and it counterbalances the fear with passion. **The prefrontal cortex lights up when you dream about the possibilities in the world, and this activation sends signals to your neurons to form new pathways for behavior.** Scientists call this process of building new behavior pathways _neuroplasticity_. The more you think about your amazing future, the stronger the connections become until they are fully functioning new pathways of beliefs.

Those strengthened beliefs create strengthened actions. Therefore, you can reduce the effects of fear and doubt by continuing to develop your compelling vision and become passionate about achieving it.

#### Four Stages of Vision Creation

Enjoy yourself when you decide to form a compelling vision. This part of the process is benign by nature. You haven’t committed to any actions yet, and you haven’t wagered any of your comfort at this point. You are merely dreaming, and you shouldn’t be afraid to dream big. Envision a future you feel passionate about and that encompasses your deepest aspirations. **You can’t achieve greatness if you can’t envision magnificent things. If your vision isn’t big enough to make you uncomfortable, you’re not pushing your desires to the edge.**

If your vision is significant enough, you will experience four different beliefs regarding it as you formulate your plan to achieve it: impossible, possible, probable, and given.

##### **An Impossible Dream**

When you envision something beyond your wildest dreams for your future, you’ll believe that attaining it is impossible. You’ll say, “How in the world could I ever make that happen?” This is the wrong question at this point in the process. The correct question is, “What would my life look like if this vision actually came true?”

The reason it’s important not to worry about the _how_ at this point is that there’s no possible way for you to know. If you knew how to make it happen, you would have by now. And **when you realize you don’t know the _how_, you’ll start to adjust your vision to something smaller and seemingly more accessible, which will hinder your ability to grow exponentially**. Henry Ford said something to the effect of _whether you think you can or you can’t, you’re right._ If you believe your goal is unattainable, it will be. So release the restrictions on your imagination and ask, “What if?” This will help you move to the next stage of _possible_.

##### **A Possible Dream**

You shift the thought patterns in your mind when you start to wonder what your life would be like if you accomplished your goals. As you envision the benefits of this new life spiritually, emotionally, professionally, and financially, the vision becomes more real and your desire deepens. All it takes is a tiny shred of belief to make your dream feel possible, and when you’re comfortable with the possibility of achieving your vision, you begin to believe it’s probable.

##### A Probable Dream

The moment you believe your vision is no longer a pipe dream but something that could very well be achieved is the right moment to ask, “How?” The question of how to make your dream a reality is the motivation that jump-starts the planning process. And once you start to plan, you begin to truly believe, which takes you to the last stage.

##### **A Given Reality**

You don’t doubt whether you’ll achieve your vision of your future. **You now believe fully that you will because you’ve gone through the steps of determining how to reach it.** This powerful mindset places you squarely in your future, and the rest of your life falls in line with that belief.

### How to Craft a Compelling Vision

Separate your vision into three different levels: long-term goals, short-term goals, and immediate goals. This last level represents the goals and processes of the 12-week plan, which will be explained in a later chapter. The first two levels are designed to keep your motivation for change moving forward and provide the information you need to develop a strong 12-week plan.

- Long-term goals are the lofty ideas you have about your life once you’ve accomplished all the steps to attain your desired end result. **Form this vision by taking a few minutes to write down what’s important to your physical, mental, spiritual, relational, financial, professional, and personal arenas of life.** What legacy do you want to leave? What lifestyle do you want to live? What experiences do you want your family to have? Who do you want to be? How much do you want to make? Choose the items that resonate the most, and form a vision from them.
- Short-term goals are those you want to achieve over the next three years. Based on your long-term vision, what aspects of the process are most attainable first. Be specific so you will know how to shape your 12-week plan.

#### Visions for Your Business

You can use the tools in this section to promote vision-building and successful implementation of the necessary processes in your company. **Talk to your subordinates about their goals, visions of the future, and plans to achieve them.** Review their visions with them on a one-on-one basis frequently to ensure they are staying on track with their actions.

After your employees are clear on their personal visions, bring them together to form a team vision. Go through the long-term goals and short-term goals, and find out what their ideal work life and environment look like. Then, decide as a group the best strategies to make those visions a reality.

Some questions you might ask your team are the following:

- Why is your vision important to you?
- How will your life change if you reach your vision?
- Are you willing to go through the costs of change to achieve the benefits?
- Who else knows about your vision?
- How often do you refer back to your vision during your work?
- What is your 12-week plan to start working toward your vision?
- What can I do to support your process?

#### The Dos and Don’ts of Vision Achievement

Avoid these common errors in working toward your vision, and use the supportive elements to enrich your chances for success.

**Don’t:**

- Don’t dismiss the power of a compelling vision to guide your life.
- Don’t create a vision that isn’t close to your heart.
- Don’t limit your imagination when you create your vision.
- Don’t perform any actions that don’t align with your vision.

**Do:**

- Do tell others about your dreams.
- Do check in with your vision frequently to ensure you’re on track.
- Do structure your life with intention to stay on the right path.
