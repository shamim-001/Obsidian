## Chapter 2: Freeing Ourselves Through Radical Acceptance

Many of us may be trapping ourselves without even realizing it. The following anecdote gives a literal example of this principle.

There was a tiger named Mohini who lived at the Washington, D.C. National Zoo. She spent most of her life pacing around her 12x12 cage. Finally, biologists and zoo staff worked together to create what they thought would be an ideal enclosure: an area that covered several acres, complete with hills, a pond, and lots of different plants. They thought she’d be happy there.

However, when they moved her to the new enclosure, she immediately went to one small corner of it and spent the rest of her life there, pacing around an area the size of her old cage. Mohini was trapped in her old patterns, unable to understand the freedom that she now had.

It’s a deeply sad story, but one with a lesson that many of us can benefit from. Like Mohini, many of us spend our lives trapped in the same fearful, judgmental patterns, never realizing that we can be so much freer and happier than we think.

### Accept Everything

**The way out of this self-imposed prison starts with accepting everything about ourselves, our lives, and our experiences.** This means being aware of everything that’s happening inside our minds at bodies at every moment, and embracing it. It means not shying away from sorrow or pain. It means recognizing our desires and dislikes without judging ourselves for them, or feeling forced to act upon them. (However, Radical Acceptance does _not_ mean accepting harmful behavior, either from ourselves or anyone else.)

Radical Acceptance goes against all of our conditioned reactions. Rather than embracing physical and emotional pain, we tend to resist it. We tense up our muscles and our minds. We start thinking about what could be causing the pain, how long it might last, what we can do to make it go away. Perhaps we blame ourselves for the pain, thinking that it’s a sign of our own shortcomings.

Even when things are going well, we start telling ourselves stories about how we don’t deserve the good fortune, when it might end, or how it’ll lead to more pain in the long run (like eating an ice cream cone while worrying about how many calories are in it).

By building up these narratives around our experiences, we distance ourselves from the experiences themselves. The narratives often devolve into harmful mantras about how we have to do more, do better, _be_ better to make the pain stop. Even our good experiences are tainted with anxiety because we don’t simply accept them as they happen.

#### Two Aspects of Radical Acceptance

**There are two key aspects of Radical Acceptance: recognition and compassion.** The first part, recognition, is what Buddhists often call _mindfulness_. This is the practice of understanding what is happening to us physically, mentally, and emotionally, without being ruled by it.

For example, if we’re afraid, we might recognize that our minds are racing, our bodies are tense, and we feel compelled to run away. In doing this, we don’t try to change or manage the experience, we simply take it as-is. **We can’t accept an experience until we clearly see what we’re accepting.**

The second aspect, compassion, is responding with care and tenderness. Rather than judging ourselves harshly for what we feel or think, we honor the experience. However, that doesn’t mean that we indulge all of our desires. Rather, we acknowledge them and look upon them with tenderness and care.

Instead of berating ourselves for wanting a candy bar, for instance, we simply accept that at this point in time we feel the desire for a candy bar. That doesn’t mean we have to have one—though we could—we simply understand and accept our desire for what it is.

Both aspects are needed for Radical Acceptance. **Either one on its own will create an unbalanced and harmful mindset.**

Recognition without compassion may leave us aware of what we’re experiencing, but without the tools to cope with it. We could end up digging ourselves deeper into those feelings by dwelling on them, or judging and blaming ourselves for getting into whatever situation caused them.

Compassion without recognition causes a different kind of problem: Instead of trapping ourselves in self-reproach, we trap ourselves in self-pity. We create narratives wherein we tried our best but still couldn’t get what we wanted or needed. This is the trap of accepting experiences without truly understanding them.

### Radical Acceptance Brings Freedom

**Feeling unworthy puts us into a sort of trance.** We can’t see past our own perceived shortcomings; our self-image becomes twisted and ugly, and we feel unkind both toward ourselves and others. We become like the tiger Mohini, spending our lives pacing one tiny corner of a large, beautiful enclosure.

Radical Acceptance is how we awaken from the trance. Recognition of, and compassion for, our own moment-to-moment experiences help us to recognize when we’re caught in harmful patterns. We must recognize when we’re stuck in habits of fighting (others or ourselves), judging (again, others or ourselves), and trying to control our pleasures and pains.

With that understanding, we can start to see other ways forward. If we stop being so afraid of unpleasant experiences and demanding people, and learn to forgive ourselves for our own mistakes, we can start taking down the defenses that block out so much of the world. **Rather than trying to control life, we can simply live it.**

Buddhists call this _clear comprehension_: seeing things as they are, including the patterns of our lives and the broader consequences of our thoughts and actions. If Mohini had the capacity for clear comprehension, she’d have realized that she had acres of land to roam.

#### Radical Acceptance From Suffering

It may seem impossible to embrace Radical Acceptance when we need it most, when we are in our deepest trances of unworthiness. However, you must remember the Buddha nature that lives in all of us. It’s the core of our essence, eternal and unchangeable. **The nature of the mind is recognition; the nature of the heart is compassion.** The aspects of Radical Acceptance are always with us, no matter how lost we may feel.

In fact, it’s often only when we hit our lowest points that we truly open up to Radical Acceptance. Alcoholics Anonymous’s 12-step program says that “rock bottom” is the turning point where one can start to recover from addiction. **That’s because rock bottom is when the addict realizes that his or her current lifestyle isn’t working.** It often takes some terrible shock for people to realize that they have to make a change, and it’s the same with embracing Radical Acceptance.

Brach shares a deeply personal story about the moment when she first began to truly understand Radical Acceptance. She was living in her ashram with her husband and she became pregnant. At first they were overjoyed, but she suffered a miscarriage and lost the baby. Then, when she needed support the most, her teacher publicly shamed her. He said that the miscarriage had been her own fault; that she was too focused on her professional life outside of the ashram, and the stress had killed her baby.

It was only as Brach grappled with the emotional trauma of those two devastating blows—the loss of her child and being rejected by her teacher—that she started to accept herself as she was. Rather than fighting the pain, she began to embrace it, to allow it to wash over her without changing her.

She realized that she wanted to love herself, even if she were as flawed as her teacher claimed. She didn’t want to be constantly watching and judging herself, fighting against the voice that said there was something wrong with her. She realized that she was a being of understanding and compassion, and no aspect of her—including those aspects that were “flawed” or not what she thought they should be—could affect that deepest self.

While the specifics of Brach’s situation were extraordinary, the theme is a common one: **We often find that we have to be truly, deeply injured before we can begin to heal.**

### Common Misunderstandings

Radical Acceptance is so much the opposite of how we’re trained to think about ourselves that people can get confused about what it actually is. If your Radical Acceptance leads you to “accept” and continue harmful practices and habits, you’re not practicing it correctly. Let’s examine a few common misconceptions:

**Radical Acceptance isn’t about giving up.** Some people come away with the idea that accepting yourself as you are means giving up on personal growth. However, Radical Acceptance isn’t an excuse to say “this is who I am, and that’ll never change.” Instead, it’s an opportunity to recognize who you are currently, and who you’d really like to be—rather than who society says you should be. In short, it’s impossible to change yourself without first knowing yourself.

**Radical Acceptance isn’t about limitations.** Some people think that Radical Acceptance means accepting that there are things they can’t do, or aren’t suited for. For instance, someone who’s been in a string of failed relationships might look at himself and conclude that he’s not suited for intimacy. However, that’s not what Radical Acceptance is. If anything, it’s the exact opposite: He’s giving power to the fearful voice in his head that says he’s not good enough.

Radical Acceptance means looking honestly at your failures and successes alike, and _accepting_ that you don’t know what the future holds. It means putting your full effort into everything you do, and learning and growing from every experience.

**Radical Acceptance isn’t about self-indulgence.** Accepting that you have a desire and acting upon it are two different things. For example, a habitual smoker would recognize not only that she has a craving for a cigarette, but the reasons behind that craving. She would recognize the physical and emotional tension that comes with it. She would read the warning label and accept that smoking is a harmful and dangerous habit.

If she does decide to smoke, she wouldn’t try to justify her decision or struggle against her guilt; she’d accept the feelings just as she accepted the craving that led to her decision. Hopefully, in time, recognizing the truths behind her actions will lead her to better decisions.

**Radical Acceptance isn’t about being passive.** Many people think that accepting something means you no longer work to change it. For example, they say that accepting something like racism, or global warming, means allowing it to progress unchecked.

However, Radical Acceptance is about what’s happening internally, not externally. It begins with examining our own outrage, fear, guilt, or whatever we’re feeling about those injustices. Before we act or react to what’s happening, we have to understand and accept how it’s affecting us in that moment. With that kind of self-awareness we’re able to act wisely and effectively, rather than blindly and desperately.

**Radical Acceptance isn’t about accepting a “self.”** This misunderstanding is specific to Buddhism, which teaches that there’s no such thing as a true self—what might be called a soul. Many students of Buddhism point out that accepting yourself as you are seems to imply the existence of such a “self,” which is incompatible with Buddha’s teachings.

However, Radical Acceptance is really about the mental and physical sensations you’re currently experiencing. It’s accepting yourself as you are in the moment. By doing so, you’ll recognize that those experiences are temporary and impersonal, not some core part of who you are. **This will help free you from the illusion that you’re a limited being, defined by your experiences.**
