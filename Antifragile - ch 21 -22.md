## Chapters 21-22: Interventionism and Fragility

In Chapter 21 we explore how and why human intervention so often causes more problems than it solves. In short, it’s because we’re pitting our fragile models and theories against nature’s countless years of evolution and antifragility. We also explore the idea of exponential benefit and harm—effects that rapidly outpace the size or apparent significance of the events that caused them. Medicine provides excellent examples of both points.

Chapter 22 is about how human efforts to live forever are doomed to fail—and why that’s a good thing. **Without individual fragility, there can be no societal antifragility.** This argument grows from the points laid down in Chapter 21 about how human interventionism does more harm than good.

### Intervention Leads to Fragility

Remember the definition of _iatrogenics_: unintended harm from medical treatment. Iatrogenics is common due to two logical flaws.

**The first flaw is the human need to _do something_.** Even if someone has a minor injury or disease that will heal perfectly well on its own, many people—especially doctors—feel like they have to intervene. Someone with a mild fever may take aspirin to bring it down to normal, or put ice on a swollen nose to take the swelling down—even though there’s no evidence that doing so helps it to heal faster.

**The second flaw is mistaking a lack of evidence for evidence.** For example, smoking was once considered to have mental and physical health benefits. The harm that it caused wouldn’t become obvious for many years, and people mistook that lack of evidence for evidence that smoking isn't harmful.

These two tendencies combine to create a situation where harmful drugs and procedures—which we don’t yet know are harmful—are given to people who would have been just fine without them.

Statisticians have estimated that reducing medical expenditures (only up to a point and only on elective treatments) would actually increase the average lifespan in wealthy countries like the U.S. by reducing iatrogenics. This is one large-scale application of the “less is more” principle.

### Convexity in Medicine

This isn’t an argument that medical care should never be given, just that we should be much more discerning about when and how much we intervene. The iatrogenics of any given drug or treatment are linear—they increase or decrease consistently with how much of the treatment is given. However, the benefits of that treatment can be convex (having accelerating benefits) based on how severe the patient’s condition is.

For example, there’s a particular drug that treats high blood pressure. When a patient suffers from mild hypertension, the effectiveness rate of this drug is only 5.6%. However, when the patient’s blood pressure is in the “high” range, the effectiveness rate is 26%; in the “severe” range it climbs to 72%. However, the side effects of the drug are consistent across all of those categories.

**Clearly, then, the trick is to only intervene when the benefits outweigh the risks.** In the case of the heart medication described above, it doesn’t make sense to give it to someone who only has mild hypertension; the patient will get all the downsides and probably none of the benefits. However, for someone who would die or have severely reduced quality of life without medical intervention, the iatrogenics are relatively small. The person has little to lose, so there’s not much harm that can be done.

#### Fooled by Randomness

However, instead of this rational approach, people will try to intervene whenever there’s the slightest hint of a problem. Someone whose blood pressure is perfectly normal may, at times, be slightly above or slightly below normal just through random chance and variation. If it happens to be high when he’s at the doctor’s office, that doctor might prescribe totally unnecessary medication to lower it. In the end, this will probably cause more harm than good. This is a classic example of being _fooled by randomness_.

**People are fooled by randomness when they mistake a single data point, like an elevated blood pressure, for a trend.** Perhaps the man had too much coffee that morning, or he was nervous about something; that one reading isn’t proof of a trend of high blood pressure, but the doctor took it as such.

A larger-scale example of being fooled by randomness would be the oft-cited statistic that the average lifespan used to be just 30 years, up until the 19th century or so. The key word there is _average_: It’s skewed heavily by people who died young, either at birth or in early childhood.

**There’s also a case of epiphenomena here: confusing correlation with causation.** It’s true that medicine has advanced greatly in the last few hundred years, and it’s also true that the average lifespan is much longer than it used to be. However, that doesn’t mean that one necessarily caused the other. There are many other possible explanations, such as improved sanitation and increased law enforcement, that could also account for (or at least contribute to) people’s longer lives.

### Evolution: the Ultimate Antifragility

The reason iatrogenics are so common—and why everything that humans try to control from the top-down tends to fall apart—is because people are trying to outsmart nature. Nature proceeds by evolution, which has redundancies and fail-safes built in as we’ve discussed before.

People tend to think that science is rigorous, while nature isn’t. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Things that exist in nature have been subjected to countless random events over thousands, if not millions, of years, allowing fragile things to break and antifragile things to become stronger. **Though we may not always understand how or why something natural works, we can rest assured that it does.**

Compared to that, human attempts to control the world through mathematics, models, and science are hopelessly flawed. So many major catastrophes, from wars to global warming, are the result of humans trying to impose their will where it isn’t wanted nor needed.

**Therefore, we need to reverse the burden of evidence.** When people introduce some unnatural thing into the world, like smoking or nuclear power plants, there will always be people who argue that it’s dangerous. The burden of evidence currently rests with those people; they have to somehow prove their point that it’s dangerous, when really only time can do that. Instead, the burden should be on the ones pushing the innovation to prove that it _isn’t_ harmful—or, at least, that the benefits outweigh the harm.

Some ways to do that are what we’ve discussed in previous chapters. For example, tinker with the models a bit; see what happens if you change some of the fundamental assumptions, and whether the benefits increase more quickly than the damage. Alternatively (or even better, additionally), rather than trying to eliminate risk—which is impossible—make sure that you’re fully prepared for the worst-case scenario.

#### Other Forms of Interventionism

**It’s not just in medicine _per se_ where human intervention seems likely to have some iatrogenics.** As previously mentioned, our current trend of global warming was an unforeseen effect of industrialization. However, there are also many personal choices people make that go against what nature has concluded from millennia of trial and error.

For example, modern people have access to a steady supply of food. They have no chance to enjoy the benefits of intermittent fasting unless they specifically avoid food for a while. Even more than fasting, people tend to avoid variety in their diets; ancient humans would have had to eat whatever they could catch or forage, while modern people suffer from eating the same over-processed foods day after day.

Nowadays, people also tend to avoid walking as much as possible. Their lives are lived in front of monitors, with (perhaps) occasional breaks to exercise. However, our ancestors were persistence hunters; they would unhurriedly and easily walk after their prey, possibly for days at a time. There may be some unknown benefits to easy, stress-free walking that vary from the benefits of power walking or jogging.

These things may have iatrogenics or they may not. The point is simply that humans have an abysmal track record when they ignore what natural evolution has designed them for.

### Empiricism Trumps Theory

One major way we could avoid such risks is to take an empirical, rather than theoretical, approach. **In other words, to acknowledge that we know _what_ happens, and it doesn’t matter _why_ it happens.**

Consider what happens when you lift weights: Your muscles become bigger and stronger. One explanation is that your muscles experience microtears and increase in size as they heal. A more recent idea has to do with hormonal signaling in response to stress. No doubt at some point in the future, there will be other theories. However, none of that changes the empirical observation that lifting weights makes you stronger.

Proceeding based on what we know to be true, rather than what we think are the reasons behind it, would avoid the problem of relying on fragile theories and models. For example, people found that eating fats and carbohydrates together led to weight gain. That was the empirical observation.

However, upon an analysis of that fact, doctors and mathematicians decided that the fats were to blame. This led to the “fat-free” craze in food service and marketing. However, they made an elementary statistical mistake: When two factors are jointly responsible for an observed outcome, sometimes it seems that only one of them is to blame.

In short, we need to accept and understand that there are—and probably always will be—things we don’t know. In trying to reduce calories in food, scientists developed and introduced all kinds of artificial sweeteners, only to learn later that they caused everything from weight gain to cancer. The _theory_ was that, since calories are associated with gaining weight, reducing the calories would make the food healthier. However, the things they didn’t know—the side effects—outweighed those benefits.

### The Fragility of “Me”

**Another modern trend—only dating back to the Enlightenment—is the fear of death.** Ancient literature is filled with stories of great heroes seeking not immortality, but a good and honorable death.

People back then saw themselves as part of the larger whole of humanity, defined by what they contributed to the world and the children who survived them. The idea that the individual is the most important thing, and that each individual should be preserved as long as possible, is quite a recent one.

An individual life is naturally a fragile thing. **It has to be, in order for the species to be antifragile—remember that antifragility can only occur after damage.** Though scientists continue to artificially lengthen life, and some even seek the keys to immortality, we’re not meant to live forever as the sick, fragile animals that we are. We’re meant to live well, and then die to make room for others.
