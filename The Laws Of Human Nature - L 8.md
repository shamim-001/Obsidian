## Law #8: People’s Individuality Is Overpowered by Groups

No matter how highly we think of our individuality, **social force and group dynamics affect us all.** If you think you’re exempt, ask yourself:

- Have you ever long-term openly supported an idea that doesn’t agree with your group's values? (You probably haven’t, or if you have, it was probably only once or twice.)
- Have you gone along with a bad group decision? (You probably do this regularly.)

Being in a group influences us in the following ways:

**Influence #1: We want to belong.** When we first join a group, we’re an outsider, and we can feel the members of the group judging us and assessing if we’re dangerous. There are two ways to fit in, and the first is most important, but most people chose to do both:

- Match our ideas and values to the group members’. You might keep your own opinions on certain things, but not on topics that the group is passionate about.
    - (Shortform example: If the group values the environment, you’ll start to value the environment too.)
- Match our physical appearance to group members’.
    - For example, your workplace might have a dress code that everyone follows, and you’ll follow it too.

Most of this matching happens unconsciously or in a way that _appears_ to be intentional (we joined the group _because_ we shared its values). However, if we look at a group from the outside, we’ll find that its members’ values are surprisingly consistent, considering how much everyone is unique. This consistency is caused by social force driving people to conform.

**Influence #2: We need to perform.** When in a group, we visibly demonstrate how much we belong. We put on masks so that we fit in better, but the longer we spend with the group, the more the mask becomes the reality.

- For example, you might initially be _purposefully_ deferential to your boss, but over time this deference becomes unconscious.

The need for performance, like mask-wearing in general, isn’t something we need to fight or feel bad about—it’s wired in to everyone. What we _do_ need to do is be aware of this influence so we can be more intentional about the image we present.

**Influence #3: Other people’s emotions overpower our own.** When we’re alone, our moods change, but if we’re in a group and a group member or members’ emotions are stronger than ours, they’ll replace them. Fear and anxiety are the most contagious emotions because they helped us survive. Apathy, tiredness, excitement, joy, hatred, desire, and rage are also quite contagious.

**Influence #4: We become incredibly certain.** By ourselves, we tend to doubt our choices. In a group, though, we tend to be certain of the decisions we’ve made, even if they’re risky or inadvisable. This is because in a group:

- It takes a lot of effort to come to a consensus, so we’re inclined to stick with whatever’s determined.
- If we don’t agree with the group, we feel like outsiders, and we never want to feel this way.
- If many people agree on a course of action, that makes it seem legitimate.

For example, financial bubbles are often caused by this influence. If everyone’s buying up stock in a certain company, it seems safer than doing it alone, where if it went badly, we’d feel ashamed.

In this chapter, we’ll first learn how to manage the toxic types that emerge in groups. Then, we’ll learn how to control our own nature.

### Manage Toxic Types: Group Dynamics

To understand how groups produce toxic types, first, we’ll look at some basics of group dynamics. These dynamics are impossible to avoid—if you try to opt out, you’ll look suspicious or holier-than-thou, and you’ll be isolated from the group.

#### Dynamic #1: Culture

Groups often have their own language, customs, and way of doing things. This is most obvious between nations, but smaller groups, such as companies, have culture too. To assess group culture, don’t put much stock in how the group self-describes. Instead, consider the overall attitude and organization by looking at its actions and emotional tone.

- For example, some groups use a strict hierarchy and carefully control the flow of information.

Culture often includes:

- **An ideal.** The group may not actually demonstrate this ideal, but the members are bonded by striving for it.
    - For example, a group might be progressive or liberal.
- **The founders’ qualities.** Whoever started the group probably had a strong influence on its culture.

**Group culture can become so entrenched that new members, even leaders, can’t change it.** For example, after World War II, the U.S. Department of Defense had an aggressive culture. Neither President Kennedy nor Johnson wanted to get involved in the Vietnam War, but they were unable to change the culture—in fact, the culture changed _them_ and they became involved in the war. **The older and larger the group, the stronger its culture.**

Additionally, **the older and larger a group, the more its culture will become conservative.** This is because people want to maintain what they have, and as the group still exists, members think that their established ways of doing things will work forever. In fact, this inability to adapt is often what kills groups in the end.

#### Dynamic #2: Fear of the Outsider

Whether or not an outsider really is dangerous, **having a collective enemy strengthens a group.** Since the human brain processes best by comparing things to their opposites, us vs. them works well. The enemy can also be used as a justification for potentially questionable actions or as a distraction.

If our group is threatened, all four of the group influences strengthen. We think even more simply and unquestionably follow the groups’ decisions.

To figure out if an outsider actually is dangerous, consider her objectively—don’t let the groups’ opinions bias you. Do this privately, so you’re not accused of disloyalty.

#### Dynamic #3: Unwritten Rules

People can’t handle rampant disorder, so **groups come up with rules and behavioral codes about appearances, deference to authority, and so on.** These unwritten rules are self-policed by group members.

#### Dynamic #4: Factions

**In large, established groups, people will self-divide into factions because they want to be around those who are most similar to them** (being around similar people gives a narcissistic boost). Additionally, by nature, we see larger groups as suspicious. Factions will ultimately break into even smaller factions.

Powerful factions will start to prioritize their own interests over the group’s and can even oust the leader.

- For example, the elites of a group often form a faction because they want to maintain their status.

The smaller groups of tribalism are part of our nature, but they make for a lot of fighting because there are few people in our group and a lot of people outside of them. To survive, humans will have to overcome this part of our natures. We’re so globally interconnected that we need each other to survive. What we really need is to all feel like we’re part of one group with diverse membership—the group of humanity.

#### Dynamic #5: Hierarchy

**Groups contain hierarchies of individuals and/or factions, and everyone is trying to get closer to the leader** (the closer they are, the more power they have). For the most part, individuals admire the leader and think she’s superior, which makes it possible for them to accept that she has power over them. This is the same way we felt about our parents in childhood—because our parents controlled us, we had to cast them as competent so we could cope. Individuals tend to react to the leaders however they handled their family members, whether that was a need to please or resentment.

On the other hand, some group members, instead of wanting to get closer to the leader, want to displace her.

There are several types of group members, categorized by how they feel about power:

##### Type #1: The Power-Hungry

These types _appear_ loyal and hard-working, but in fact, **they don’t respect the leader and want power for themselves.** As children, they might have competed with their fathers.

To identify these types, look at their past and their actions, rather than their mask. They’re good at using others and making people in power depend on them. They also tend to be impatient.

The best way to deal with these types is to **avoid them—you don’t want to become an enemy or a tool.**

For example, Alexander Haig was a power-hungry type. He was an assistant to Henry Kissinger, who in turn was Richard Nixon’s national security advisor. Haig made himself very useful to Kissinger by doing all sorts of tasks, even grunt work, and used his closeness to gather information on Kissinger’s weaknesses.

Haig also made himself appealing to Nixon—he made sure Nixon saw him working long hours, which he knew Nixon would appreciate because he was also a workaholic. Nixon started borrowing Haig from Kissinger and eventually made him chief of staff, a position Kissinger reported to.

##### Type #2: The Information Controller

These types try to control the flow of information to the leader. They can be useful—they protect the leader from distractions and low-priority requests—but they’re also dangerous because **they strongly idealize the leader and want to have power over her specifically.** They get close by flattering, fawning, and feeding her narcissism, and once they’re close, they learn the leader’s weaknesses.

You can identify these by how differently they act towards the leader than everyone else. Additionally, they often act as the enforcer of the group’s unwritten rules.

When you encounter these types, be careful. If you make them your enemy, they’ll cut off your access to the leader. **You can try to expose their contradictory behavior between the leader and the rest of the group to the leader**, but because this type is so close to the leader, the leader may take their word over yours. **If you are the leader, don’t let individuals isolate you from the rest of the group.**

##### Type #3: The Chaos-Causer

These types are insecure, resentful, and envious of others, but they’re good at hiding these emotions by appearing loyal. **They try to stir up drama to get attention, to attract the leader’s notice, and to get closer to her.** They do this by spreading rumors about other group members’ loyalty.

To identify these types, look for someone who’s spreading rumors, and in chaotic moments, look for someone who seems to secretly enjoy the negativity.

To deal with these types, **never insult them—they’ll target you and be passive-aggressive.**

##### Type #4: The Egger-On

These types are good at identifying others’ Shadows, especially the leader’s, and **eggers-on encourage others to let their Shadows loose.** They do this by bringing up a shadow subject in a casual way, which makes the leader feel unthreatened enough to respond. Then, the egger-on suggests how they might act on these feelings.

To identify these types, look for people who have strong Shadows that they’re fairly in touch with.

To deal with these types, **keep your distance and don’t cross them. They often self-destruct on their own**—if something they encouraged the leader to do goes badly, they get blamed.

For example, Charles Colson was an egger-on. He was Nixon’s special counsel and knew that part of Nixon’s Shadow included paranoia and insecurity about his masculinity. Colson encouraged Nixon to vent and suggested ways to get revenge on the media, who had criticized Nixon.

##### Type #5: The Joker or Rebel

**Jokers and rebels are scared to fail,** so they make fun of others, act cynical, and suggest outlandish ideas so that no one will take them seriously or give them any responsibility. **Their role becomes to make everyone else feel a little superior.**

Usually, there’s one person allowed to play this role in a given group, and to identify them, look for the person who is permitted to make fun of anyone in the group, even the leader (the leader permits this because it shows she has a sense of humor and isn’t insecure). They’re also the only person allowed to come up with ideas that conflict with the groups’ (the leader allows this because it makes her seem like she allows dissent).

To deal with this type, **let her keep her role.** If you feel the need to rebel, keep it private or subtle.

##### Type #6: The Favorite

**This type holds the highest position in a hierarchy.** She likely got this position by being personable and friendly, not by demonstrating loyalty or having notable skills. Many leaders are lonely, so a friend is attractive.

To identify this type, look for the person the leader gives favors or special treatment to.

To deal with the favorite, like the Joker or Rebel, **let her keep her position.** You don’t want to be the favorite because it’s dangerous:

- The favorite becomes entitled and spoiled, which makes her less likable to the leader.
- If the favorite disappoints the leader, she won’t just lose her position, the leader may hate her, because being disappointed by a friend hurts more than being disappointed by someone else.
- Everyone else in the group is envious of the favorite and won’t help her.

##### Type #7: The Least Favorite

This type is the opposite of the favorite—**she holds the lowest position in the hierarchy and everyone feels superior to her,** whether in intelligence, skill, sophistication, or something else.

To identify this type, figure out who’s made fun of behind her back.

To navigate around this type, don’t make fun of her because it will debase you. **Take the high ground and treat her well, and you might make yourself an ally.**

##### Type #8: The Reflectors

These types can charm leaders and group members. They do this by acting as emotional mirrors—**they validate people by reflecting their own opinions and emotions back at them.**

To identify these types, look for people with high empathy.

**To deal with these types, try to emulate them.** Work on your empathy, nonverbal cues, and mirroring.

For example, Frances Perkins, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s advisor and secretary of labor, was a master reflector. She used her empathy to intuit Roosevelt’s moods. She knew he liked stories, so when she wanted something, she’d present it as a narrative. She listened deeply and then reflected what he’d spoken about back to him.

She mirrored everyone else the same way and was careful to be nonthreatening. She had a huge influence over Roosevelt but never showed it.

### Control Your Own Nature: Maintain Individuality and Gain Power

Now that we better understand how groups work, we can look at how to maintain our individuality in the face of social force and even gain power.

#### Maintain Your Individuality

There are a few strategies for maintaining your individuality when in a group:

**Strategy #1: Determine if your emotions are stemming from yourself or others** by pinpointing the source of an emotion. If you can’t find a concrete source, you may be picking up the emotion from others. Analyze which group emotions you’re most susceptible to and how they change depending on which group you’re in.

- (Shortform example: If you’re hiking in a group and a bear crashes out of the woods, the source of your fear is concrete and obvious. If there’s nothing immediately dangerous in your surroundings but you still feel fear, you might be picking it up from someone else.)

**Strategy #2: Get some distance.** If you feel like the group is overpowering you, distance yourself from the members for a little while to regain your individuality.

**Strategy #3: Raise your self-esteem.** Going along with a group is a way of hiding our insecurities, so develop your self-esteem so you no longer need this crutch. Boost your self-opinion by doing good work and accomplishing things, and by having confidence in your individuality.

**Strategy #4: Keep your individuality private.** You don't need to leave or challenge the group to maintain your ability to think rationally. Outwardly, continue to fit in. Inwardly, assess group ideas dispassionately, considering them separate from their source.

**Strategy #5: Get a measure of the groups you belong to.** Because we no longer have large belief systems—such as religion—but we still crave belonging, we sometimes join cults or groups we probably don’t actually want to get involved with. Weak groups tend to end up with grandiose or poorly skilled leaders, so look for these clues as you evaluate your groups.

**Strategy #6: Consciously learn the unwritten rules.** Most people figure them out subconsciously, but conscious knowledge heightens your awareness and will help you assess the group and navigate interactions. To do this:

- Look at who seems to be rising in the group and analyze their behavior.
- Find out what’s sacred to the group—what does no one dare criticize?
- If there’s someone who enforces the unwritten rules, observe what they permit and condemn.

**Strategy #7: Tread carefully around factions.** There are two ways to handle them and the second is preferable:

- Encourage the factions to fight among themselves to distract them from challenging you or the leader. This strategy can quickly fall apart—the leader might have to step in if conflicts between factions get out of hand.
- Unify everyone in the group by creating a positive culture that satisfies people’s need for narcissistic boosts (the appeal of factions is the narcissistic boost).

**Strategy #8: Stay realistic.** Groups tend to oversimplify. They create enemies, become delusional, and foster conviction bias (the tendency to assume if someone, including you, feels strongly about something, it must be right). Remind yourself of these dynamics so that when they start to act on you, you can notice and pull back.

**Strategy #9: Practice considering ideas that are the opposite of the group’s.** This will help you train to think for yourself.

#### Gain Power

To gain power with a group:

- **Flatter the leader.** This tends to work well because leaders always have high self-opinion and large egos. The type of flattery that works will be different in every group, but in general, overt flattery doesn’t work—when flattery is too obvious, it looks desperate. Instead, try some of the more subtle techniques as described in Law #3: People Can Be Influenced, such as praising things people are insecure or unsure about.
- **Make yourself useful.** Leaders appreciate usefulness, but make sure you don’t make them feel dependent or inferior.
- **Manage everyone else in the group.** Don’t stand out as too skilled, or you’ll trigger envy and someone will take you out. Get people on your side by listening to them, giving them credit, and managing their insecurities. If you have to act against someone, indirectly isolate them—don’t do anything aggressive.

> **Extended Example: The Chinese Cultural Revolution**
> 
> The events of the Chinese Cultural Revolution are an example of how people behave more emotionally, irrationally, and simply when in groups.
> 
> In the early days of the revolution, Jianhua was a student at Yizhen Middle School (YMS). Many of the students made posters that criticized their teachers for being counterrevolutionaries, and **Jianhua felt the need to belong, so he joined in, even though he liked most of his teachers and the other students’ actions made him uncomfortable.** As the teachers confessed to minor revolutionary infractions, Jianhua felt less sorry for them and the students’ actions appeared more justified.
> 
> One of the students, Fangpu, eventually took over the school from the teachers and started a group called the East-Is-Red Corps. **Only a few weeks later, the factioning started**—another student named Mengzhe started the Red Rebels, who believed that reason was a better strategy than the violence the East-Is-Red Corps was using. Jianhua was starting to fear Fangpu and joined the Red Rebels.
> 
> **Even though both groups worshipped Mao and had the same goals, they feared each other as outsiders and adopted an us-versus-them mentality.** When the East-Is-Red Corps kidnapped some Red Rebels, the Red Rebels discovered that one of their members was a spy and beat her up. This upset Jianhua because it went against the group’s theoretically non-violent ideals. But when the East-Is-Red accidentally killed one of the Red Rebels, Jianhua agreed with the group’s new value that responding violently was appropriate.
> 
> **This kind of factioning and chaos was happening all over the country and Mao handled it by choosing sides in each local conflict.** Mao deemed the East-Is-Red more revolutionary and the Red Rebels became officially the enemy. Jianhua and other Red Rebels were tortured, humiliated, and forced to do menial labor.
> 
> Jianhua went home for summer vacation. When he returned to YMS in September, **after having a few months of both physical and mental distance in which to recollect his individuality and rationality, he realized that that group behavior had been incredibly destructive.** Buildings were destroyed, all the teachers were gone, and classmates were dead.
