## Part 2: SpaceX

Following the success of PayPal, Musk set his sights on a new industry for his next venture: space exploration, which was an industry he believed had become stagnant. Vance explains that Musk was disappointed that NASA no longer seemed driven to get to Mars or other planets. Vance explains that Musk wanted to reinvigorate America’s interest in space exploration by advancing current technologies and showing the public that space travel was still evolving, particularly since he believes space colonization is imperative to human survival.

(Shortform note: Like Musk, Stephen Hawking believes [space exploration is crucial for human survival](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/brief-answers-to-the-big-questions#the-future-of-human-expansion), presenting two reasons for why we should colonize space: First, **our species is quickly running out of space and natural resources on earth**. Hawking believes that even if we conserve natural resources, in the long term we’re going to need more room for humanity to expand. Second, **colonizing space mitigates the risk of extinction.** Hawking warns that there is a significant probability that humans could go extinct on earth in the next millennium. But if we’ve colonized other planets by then, at least that won’t be the end of our species.)

### Starting a Commercial Space Venture

In April 2002, after discussing the possibility of space travel with scientists, Musk decided to start a commercial space venture. Vance explains that he wanted to spend between $20 million and $30 million on the venture to space. One expert estimated that it would actually take $200 million.

Musk decided to build a rocket from scratch rather than trying to buy a refurbished one. The experts he’d recruited for the project thought the idea was impossible given his budget. But Musk had made a detailed plan, and after looking over the data, Musk’s team agreed it was viable. They aimed to launch a rocket into orbit in a year and a half.

(Shortform note: In _[Think Like a Rocket Scientist](https://shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist)_, the author discusses why Musk’s decision to build the rocket from scratch was so successful. Musk used [first-principles thinking by questioning his goal](https://shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist#how-rocket-scientists-use-first-principles-thinking) and realizing that what he really needed wasn’t a rocket: It was a way to get to space. By taking this approach, he was able to evaluate the problem from a different perspective and find a creative solution that addressed his true goal.)

The next month, Musk started Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, putting $100 million into the company. He assembled an initial team of scientists and engineers to work on the rocket, and they hired more employees almost every week.

Vance notes that because of Musk’s ambitious deadlines and high expectations, this team worked 12-hour days, six days a week to create the rocket (the Falcon 1) and the engine (Merlin), spending long periods of time at the test facility in Texas and away from their families. Unlike other aerospace companies, Musk focused on making the rocket cheaper and faster, which required improving existing technologies.

> **The Billionaire Space Race**
> 
> Musk isn’t the only person making a commercial space venture a reality. Some experts credit American entrepreneur [Peter Diamandis for laying the groundwork for the billionaire space race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire_space_race) in the 1990s by creating the X Prize to spur interest in space ventures. In addition to Musk’s SpaceX, several companies emerged as competitors:
> 
> **[Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin)**: Founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin also aims to make space travel cheap and reliable through reusable rocket technology. SpaceX and Blue Origin are longstanding rivals, as are their founders Musk and Bezos. But Blue Origin doesn’t seem to have any intention of going to Mars since [Bezos thinks it’s a “dumb” idea](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1464374/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-mars-space-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-spt).
> 
> **[Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic)**: Founded in 2004 by Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic focuses more on space tourism than exploration. In February 2022, Virgin Galactic announced that passenger tickets were available for purchase for $450,000.
> 
> While private investors seem interested in funding these ventures, [not everyone is impressed by these wealthy efforts to travel in space](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/12/21/billionaire-space-race-turns-into-a-publicity-disaster/?sh=2cff607c5e4d). A study found that over three quarters of the people in the UK believe these [billionaires](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22911159/new-space-age-billionaires-culture)—who are worth over $400 billion—[should focus on solving problems like world hunger and climate change](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22911159/new-space-age-billionaires-culture), not space exploration that can only be afforded by the very wealthy.

### Test Launches in Kwaj

In May 2005, SpaceX completed a test where the rocket successfully burned for five seconds on a launchpad. Vance explains that the team was encouraged by this progress, so they shipped equipment to the Pacific island of Kwajalein (Kwaj) to continue tests ahead of their launch. In preparation for the launch, the team faced engineering challenges, worked 12-hour days, slept in the small offices, and endured high heat and humidity.

(Shortform note: In _[Liftoff](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/liftoff-eric-berger?variant=32126620205090)_, Eric Berger interviewed SpaceX engineers who worked on the rocket in preparation for the Kwaj test launches. According to those interviews, the process of working on the Falcon 1 rocket was grueling, with one employee saying he felt like a slave. Berger also reveals that the [engineers staged a strike over a lack of food](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-rocket-engineers-island-without-food-mutiny-liftoff-book-2021-3), forcing Musk to send a helicopter with chicken wings and cigarettes for the employees. By 2007, the team had their own kitchen on the island to prevent any further issues.)

But over the course of the next (almost) three years, the SpaceX team tried and failed three times to launch the rocket from Kwaj. The reasons for the failed launches varied—a faulty valve or a fire above the engine—and each time, the team worked to quickly address each issue.

By 2008, Musk was under pressure—he only had money for one more launch, and he was also juggling problems with Tesla and in his marriage (we’ll discuss this more later). Vance explains that Musk put on a good front and boosted the morale of the SpaceX team in anticipation of the fourth launch.

Then, on September 28, 2008, the rocket launched successfully. After six years, Musk finally met his goal of getting a rocket into space. Although this was longer than Musk originally planned, SpaceX built a successful rocket faster than anyone in the industry expected.

(Shortform note: While the SpaceX team eventually succeeded with its Falcon 1 launch, it went through several failed launches first—but they eventually succeeded because they learned from their mistakes. In _[Think Like a Rocket Scientist](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist)_, Ozan Varol explains that [rocket scientists have a complicated relationship with failure](https://shortform.com/app/book/think-like-a-rocket-scientist/1-page-summary#how-rocket-scientists-learn-from-failure). Some missions (particularly those with human lives at stake) have very little room for failure. However, in every other scenario, failure is a normal part of life as a rocket scientist taking scientific risks. Therefore, scientists value “intelligent failure”: the kind of failure that can be learned from. Varol argues that good scientists approach their failures with genuine, disinterested curiosity.)

### Finances and NASA

Vance explains that while the launch marked a turning point for SpaceX, the company still had financial problems to address. Musk heard about a $1 billion contract from NASA to resupply the International Space Station, and he advocated for SpaceX and its ability to fulfill the contract. In December 2008, NASA awarded the contract to SpaceX, securing the company’s financial survival.

(Shortform note: In 2021, [NASA awarded SpaceX two more contracts](https://www.nasa.gov/office/procurement/latest-contract-releases). One is to provide launch services for the [Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-U (GOES-U) mission](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goes), which uses stationary satellites to monitor atmospheric indicators of severe weather conditions. The other is a [$2.89 billion contract to develop spacecraft to take astronauts to the moon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/).)

Following this achievement, SpaceX continued to advance their technology and build a capsule for their NASA mission. The efforts paid off: On May 22, 2012, SpaceX sent up a capsule to resupply the International Space Station, making it the first private company to do so.

(Shortform note: As of 2021, [Northrop Grumman and SpaceX are the only two commercial space companies to resupply the International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/launch/overview.html). Even after almost a decade, most other private space ventures haven’t caught up with SpaceX’s progress.)

Vance notes that SpaceX is now a leader in the aerospace industry. By 2015, it had a net worth of about $12 billion and had a 3,000-person workforce.

(Shortform note: As of October 2021, [SpaceX is now worth over $100 billion](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/elon-musk-spacex-100-billion-valuation/?utm_campaign=1146546&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=2&utm_medium=rss). Experts also predict SpaceX will make Musk a trillionaire.)

SpaceX is now known for its intense work environment and 90-hour workweeks. But this hard work pays off: The company launches a rocket about once a month and has the cheapest launches in the world. They’ve turned their attention to developing a reusable rocket, which would further reduce launch costs.

(Shortform note: Musk claims that reusable rockets are the only way to achieve cheap space flight. Since the publication of the book, SpaceX made major advancements toward this goal by [successfully reusing the rocket booster](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/space-force-clears-spacex-to-reuse-rockets-for-military-missions-.html)—the largest and most expensive part of the rocket—in its launches.)
