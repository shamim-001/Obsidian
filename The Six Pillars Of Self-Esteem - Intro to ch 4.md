# The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Part 1 | Introduction-Chapter 4: The Importance of Self-Esteem

In the modern world, most of us believe that self-esteem is essential to our psychological health. But what, exactly, is self-esteem? Why does it matter? How do you develop it, and how do others affect it?

In _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_, psychotherapist Nathaniel Branden answers these questions. He argues that **self-esteem is a reflection of how you view yourself** and that _low_ self-esteem contributes to most psychological issues, while _high_ self-esteem leads to greater achievement and happiness. Branden also contends that your self-esteem depends both on what you _and_ others—like your parents—do.

Because of Branden’s pioneering work in the field of self-esteem and multiple best-selling books on the topic, he’s often called the “father of the self-esteem movement.” His first book, _[The Psychology of Self-Esteem](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Psychology+of+Self+Esteem%3A+A+Revolutionary+Approach+to+Self+Understanding+that+Launched+a+New+Era+in+Modern+Psychology-p-9780787945268)_, is credited with introducing self-esteem to the masses in 1969. He wrote _Six Pillars_ in 1994 in response to how interpretations of self-esteem had changed since he first popularized the concept: By the 1990s, people tended to believe that self-esteem depended mostly on _external_ factors, while Branden also emphasized _internal_ factors.

This concerned Branden because you can’t develop effective methods for improving something unless you can define it. If you believe that self-esteem depends mostly on external factors, you won’t change your behavior—but Branden thought that **changing your behavior is essential to improving self-esteem.** Branden also worried that popular but ineffective methods for raising self-esteem would damage the reputations of both the concept of self-esteem and the broader field of psychology.

> work.
> 
> Notably, researchers have generally found that self-esteem has a _correlational_ relationship to various psychological and social issues and benefits, but not a causal relationship. In fact, as one critic notes, a 2003 review of the scientific literature on self-esteem found that [“self-esteem is not a major predictor of almost anything](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Levy-24/publication/332817129_The_Self-Esteem_Enigma_A_Critical_Analysis/links/5ccaff3b4585156cd7c3e5fa/The-Self-Esteem-Enigma-A-Critical-Analysis.pdf).”
> 
> **Critics also point out a persistent lack of consensus on what exactly constitutes self-esteem**. Most scientific studies today—including those referenced in our commentary throughout this guide—still describe self-esteem as a general sense of self-worth and do not focus on behaviors that either improve or lower your self-esteem. One 2019 journal article suggests that [lack of consensus on self-esteem may partly be attributable to linguistic bias](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Levy-24/publication/332817129_The_Self-Esteem_Enigma_A_Critical_Analysis/links/5ccaff3b4585156cd7c3e5fa/The-Self-Esteem-Enigma-A-Critical-Analysis.pdf): For example, the same behavior may be perceived by Person A as assertive, indicating high self-esteem, and by Person B as narcissistic. Since everybody defines various values slightly differently, it’s difficult to reach a consensus on exactly what self-esteem—or even the behaviors that Branden contends support self-esteem—entails.
> 
> Finally, Branden neglects to mention an issue that plagues both the self-esteem movement and his own work: How exactly do you measure self-esteem? [Psychologists tend to use self-reported scales](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Levy-24/publication/332817129_The_Self-Esteem_Enigma_A_Critical_Analysis/links/5ccaff3b4585156cd7c3e5fa/The-Self-Esteem-Enigma-A-Critical-Analysis.pdf), like the [Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale](https://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Self-Esteem_ROSENBERG_SELF-ESTEEM.pdf), but if you don’t know what self-esteem is exactly, it’s hard to measure. Since Branden argues that your self-esteem depends on your behavior, an accurate measure of your self-esteem would likely depend on how often you behave like you have self-esteem. But Branden doesn’t suggest a scientifically valid way to measure people’s self-esteem, which makes proving or disproving his ideas more difficult.

So how, exactly, can you improve your self-esteem and achieve your full potential? In _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem,_ Branden presents a roadmap for doing so.

- In Part 1, you’ll learn how Branden defines self-esteem and why it matters.
- In Part 2, you’ll learn how you can improve your own self-esteem by practicing six pillars, or categories of behaviors.
- In Part 3, you’ll learn how external factors influence your self-esteem.
- Finally, in Part 4, you’ll learn how you can nurture self-esteem in others.

### What Is Self-Esteem?

To understand why self-esteem matters and how to improve it, we must first understand what it is. In this section, you’ll learn about the two essential elements of self-esteem, and how your choices affect your self-esteem.

Branden argues that **self-esteem is the tendency to believe that you’re capable of handling the fundamental necessities of life and that you deserve happiness.** Branden calls this confidence in your own capability “self-efficacy,” and your belief that you deserve happiness “self-respect.” **_Both_** are essential ingredients of self-esteem: You cannot have healthy self-esteem if you lack either.

(Shortform note: Branden’s definition of self-esteem is unique: Most psychologists define [self-esteem as your sense of global self-worth](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code/chapter-1#related-qualities), or how much value you believe you have—which encompasses self-respect but not self-efficacy. Moreover, some psychologists define self-efficacy differently from Branden: They argue that [self-efficacy refers to your confidence to succeed in a specific task](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code/chapter-1#related-qualities), and your general confidence in your capability is simply “confidence.”)

Branden explains that the first element, self-efficacy or _capability_, is **when you trust your own mind** **and judgment**—so you feel like you control your life. You’re confident that you’re _generally_ capable: You believe that you can learn the skills you need to succeed, even if you lack those skills in a specific area. You’re also confident that you can handle the fundamental necessities of life, namely to earn a living, have healthy relationships, and recover when you face difficulties.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that being confident in your capability may be more important than how capable you actually are, at least when it comes to how others perceive you. In _[The Confidence Code](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code)_, Katty Kay and Claire Shipman note that [](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code#why-confidence-matters)people who think they’re capable (even if they’re objectively not) [exude nonverbal cues that make them seem confident](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code#why-confidence-matters) and inspire respect from others.)

The second element, self-respect or _worthiness_, entails **believing you deserve happiness because you are generally good and inherently valuable**. You believe that you’re worth making happy and that you _deserve_ to enjoy the fruits of your labor. As such, you treat yourself well and expect similar respect from others. (Shortform note: In _[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/)_, researcher Brené Brown also emphasizes the importance of worthiness, or believing that you are good enough as you are and deserve to be loved. One key to feeling worthy is to [abandon the idea that you need to fit societal expectations](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-1#defining-worthiness): You are worthy as you are.)

Crucially, Branden contends, **your self-esteem both _drives_ and _depends on_ your behavior in a never-ending cycle:** Your actions align with your expectations of yourself, which are reinforced by the consequences of those actions. (Shortform note: In _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/)_, life coach Tony Robbins contends that your [identity works similarly](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-15#know-that-your-identity-defines-not-em-who-you-are-em-but-em-what-you-do-em): Your identity is a set of beliefs about yourself, and since you strive to be consistent with your beliefs, you act in ways that reinforce your existing identity. However, Robbins attributes this striving for consistency to external societal pressure: Society says changing your beliefs is wishy-washy, so you avoid it.)

Since you have total control over your behavior, **your choices inevitably affect your self-esteem**: You can’t avoid feeling _some_ way about how you _choose_ to behave, and those feelings affect your opinion of yourself. As such, self-esteem can’t be divorced from your behavior; it’s trust in your own capability and worthiness _because_ you act in ways that support these ideas.

That said, **self-esteem depends on the pattern of choices you tend to make**—not a single choice. As such, self-esteem isn’t something you achieve once; you work on it throughout your life as it fluctuates.

(Shortform note: One study found that [middle-aged people tend to have high self-esteem that gradually declines after they reach retirement age](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-98-4-645.pdf) (around 60). Researchers posit that your self-esteem may drop as you age because of the change to your life roles—for example, you may no longer feel needed once your kids leave the nest. Branden might argue that a change in your life role necessarily encompasses a change in your behavior—and it’s this change in your _behavior_ that reduces your self-esteem.)

### Why Self-Esteem Matters

We’ve now learned what self-esteem is—but _why_ does it matter? Branden shares several reasons.

First, Branden argues, **self-esteem affects you no matter what**. You can ignore your opinion of yourself, but you cannot refrain from having one.

(Shortform note: It’s possible that the lower your self-esteem, the harder it is to ignore your opinion of yourself. In _[The Happiness Hypothesis](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/)_, psychologist Jonathan Haidt explains that humans have a [negativity bias that wires us to dislike and fear bad things](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/chapter-2#negativity-bias) more than we like good things. This may lead us to pay greater attention to negative than to positive thoughts.)

Second, Branden argues, **self-esteem promotes your well-being**, which depends on your ability to think of and select the most appropriate behavior. You’re capable of knowing the right thing to do and _choosing not to do it_—in other words, you have the free will to think and act in self-destructive ways—but high self-esteem leads you to bypass such self-destructive options in favor of choices that support your capability and worthiness.

(Shortform note: In reality, most of us _don’t_ make the best choice available, regardless of our self-esteem levels. In _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow)_, psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains that humans are subject to several cognitive biases that lead us to illogical choices—like the [availability bias](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow#cognitive-biases-and-heuristics), our tendency to overweight and recall strong emotions over less emotional but more important issues.)

As a result, **self-esteem creates self-fulfilling prophecies.** For example, people with high self-esteem keep trying when they face challenges, which makes them more likely to succeed—which raises their self-esteem. But people with low self-esteem don’t try as hard, so they’re more likely to fail, which lowers their self-esteem.

(Shortform note: While studies have found that the [higher your self-esteem, the greater you keep trying after you fail](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/1529-1006.01431), most studies have failed to find that self-esteem _causes_ success—only that the two are correlated.)

Third, Branden asserts that **self-esteem protects us from the worst life has to offer**—he calls it the “immune system of consciousness.” When you have high self-esteem, you’re able to deal with and quickly recover from life’s inevitable challenges. With low self-esteem, you lack this ability, which inhibits your success. Of course, you can technically survive without self-esteem, and self-esteem doesn’t _guarantee_ a fulfilled life, but without it, you _definitely won’t_ have the most fulfilling life possible.

(Shortform note: In fact, one study of homeless youth found that [having higher self-esteem buffered against some of the damaging effects of living on the streets](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227808829_Resilience_in_Homeless_Youth_The_Key_Role_of_Self-Esteem), like loneliness and suicidal thoughts.)

Finally, Branden argues that **self-esteem is more important than ever because you need it to survive the modern world**, which requires you to make more choices than ever before: Not only do you have total freedom over your beliefs, jobs, and spouses, but modern knowledge worker jobs also require you to take initiative and make choices in a way that factory jobs didn’t. Branden contends that the more choices you need to make, the more you need self-esteem—you must trust your own judgment, decide what matters, and act accordingly. Without self-esteem, you’ll grow afraid of these choices and escape to places that don’t require choice but are dangerous in other ways—like a cult.

> **Dealing With Decision Overload**
> 
> Even the most mentally robust people occasionally struggle with the amount of choices they must make every day: Research shows that [the decisions you make throughout the day may drain your mental energy](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html), making it more likely you’ll give into unhealthy impulses as the day goes on.
> 
> Psychologists also contend that [some mental health conditions that correlate with low self-esteem—like depression—may exacerbate this energy drain](http://realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/decision-fatigue). However, they don’t recommend improving your self-esteem to make better choices. Rather, they suggest developing routines: By reducing the number of small decisions you make each day, you conserve your mental energy for big decisions that matter.

### The Benefits of High Self-Esteem

You’ve now learned why self-esteem matters—but how, exactly, does it improve your life? In this section, you’ll learn the major benefits of self-esteem. Then, you’ll learn how self-esteem correlates positively with several traits that improve happiness.

Branden first argues that **healthy self-esteem benefits every area of your life and makes you generally happier.** This is partly due to self-fulfilling prophecies: High self-esteem drives you to take positive actions, which creates positive results, which leads to even more positive actions. For example, when you have good self-esteem, you go after and are more likely to achieve more meaningful goals.

(Shortform note: Branden’s argument that self-esteem creates self-fulfilling prophecies may be an example of [circular reasoning— a common problem with self-esteem research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Levy-24/publication/332817129_The_Self-Esteem_Enigma_A_Critical_Analysis/links/5ccaff3b4585156cd7c3e5fa/The-Self-Esteem-Enigma-A-Critical-Analysis.pdf), according to one critic. For example: Why did this person go after meaningful goals? He had high self-esteem. How do you know he had high self-esteem? Well, he went after meaningful goals.)

Branden also suggests that self-esteem correlates positively with several traits that affect your ability to succeed and be happy, including:

#### Rationality

When you’re rational, you respect evidence, and you understand that two contradictory statements cannot simultaneously be true in the same way. As such, you change your thoughts when they’re proven wrong instead of clinging to them. High self-esteem correlates with greater rationality because, as we’ll learn in Pillar #1, self-esteem requires that you look for and respond appropriately to evidence. (Shortform note: In actuality, [most of us don’t change our minds because we rarely believe we’ve been proven wrong](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds). This is due to confirmation bias, which Kahneman describes in _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/)_: We tend to [find and interpret information in ways that confirm our existing beliefs](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/part-1-5#confirmation-bias) and undervalue information that contradicts them.)

#### Intuitiveness and Creativity

Both intuitiveness and creativity require trust in your own mind. Your intuitions stem from subconscious thoughts that you can’t explain logically, so you must trust your mind enough to believe and act on such thoughts. (Shortform note: One study adds that [your unconscious assessment of your own self-esteem levels is an act of intuition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5775302_Intuition_and_the_Correspondence_Between_Implicit_and_Explicit_Self-Esteem) in and of itself.) Similarly, you only act on your creative insights if you believe that you’re _capable_ of good ones. As such, high self-esteem correlates with both intuitiveness and creativity. (Shortform note: However, research suggests a caveat: One study found that [people who have high self-esteem in a specific area are more creative in that area](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326398351_Creativity_and_Self-esteem_in_Adolescence_A_Study_of_Their_Domain-Specific_Multivariate_Relationships).)

#### Independence

When you’re confident in your own capability, you take ownership of your decisions and trust your ability to make them without others’ input—so high self-esteem correlates with higher independence. (Shortform note: This may be especially true when your self-image is questioned: One study found that [someone whose ego is threatened becomes more independent if they have high self-esteem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11597111_Self-Esteem_and_Threats_to_Self_Implications_for_Self-Construals_and_Interpersonal_Perceptions), but more reliant on others if they have low self-esteem.)

### The Consequences of Low Self-Esteem

Just as healthy self-esteem benefits you, poor self-esteem harms you. In this section, you’ll learn how having low self-esteem causes you to behave in ways that further erode your self-esteem, diminish your happiness, and create problems in your relationships and work. We’ll also discuss how low self-esteem can be concealed by a false sense of self-esteem that may ultimately cause greater harm.

Branden warns that **poor self-esteem encourages fear—and thus obstructs your ability to raise your self-esteem**. He contends that to increase your self-esteem, you must believe that you’re capable and worthy of facing reality—about yourself, others, the circumstances of your life, and the consequences of your actions. But if you suspect you’re _not_ capable or worthy, you don’t look for answers because you fear that they might prove you right: In other words, low self-esteem makes you _afraid_ of facing reality. So you instead find comfort in the idea that you behave how you do because it’s _who you are_. Your behavior aligns with this image—which, as we’ve seen, lowers your self-esteem even further, creating a vicious cycle.

For example, if you have low self-esteem, you might fear that you’re incapable of sending out a strong job application—and then grow so paralyzed by this fear that you never bother to create one. You then create an image of yourself that you’re the kind of person who can’t find a job, and then you continue behavior that prevents you from finding a job—like not filling in the application.

(Shortform note: While people with low self-esteem are afraid of their _own_ perceptions of reality, they tend to trust _external_ validation. One study suggests that [people with low self-esteem are more receptive to positive feedback from others](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5331665_Self-Esteem_Maintenance_Processes_Why_Low_Self-Esteem_may_be_Resistant_to_Change) than from themselves because they see others as more reliable. So if you’re afraid to fill out a job application, you could ask a friend to do it with you.)

Branden adds that **if you have low self-esteem, you’re more likely to struggle in your romantic relationships.** When you don’t love yourself, you’re unable to _give_ love to others. So you instead look for others to give you the approval you can’t give yourself. This isn’t really love, Branden posits, but rather a search for validation. Worse, if you _do_ receive love, you can’t accept it. When reality clashes with your narrative that you’re unlovable, you grow anxious. But you never consider that your _narrative_ is wrong. Instead, you resolve your anxiety by making reality match what you believe and taking self-sabotaging actions that prove you’re unlovable—like being cruel to partners who treat you well until they get fed up with your mistreatment and leave.

(Shortform note: One study suggests a different way people with low self-esteem sabotage their relationship: To avoid being rejected outright when they ask their partners for help, [they seek support in indirect ways—like sulking](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329138192_Low_Self-Esteem_Predicts_Indirect_Support_Seeking_and_Its_Relationship_Consequences_in_Intimate_Relationships). However, this technique backfires: The partners tend to respond negatively, and the people with low self-esteem end up without the support they wanted.)

Moreover, **low self-esteem damages your ability to succeed at work, too.** Notably, you may feel threatened by others’ success. Since you’re unconfident in your own abilities, you judge others’ accomplishments not by their own merits but by how they reflect on you: When they succeed, you feel jealous and worry that their achievement will show the world how little you’re accomplishing. This may lead you to engage in destructive behavior, like being unnecessarily rude to your successful colleague.

(Shortform note: To diminish your jealousy over others’ accomplishments, one founder recommends saying to yourself: “[Wow, I’m looking forward to reaching that milestone. What can I learn from how they got there?](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/growth-envy) Viewing their accomplishment as an achievable goal will put it in a positive light and motivate you to work on your own ventures, too.)

Finally, **some people with low self-esteem develop a false sense of self-esteem**, or “pseudo self-esteem_”_—which, Branden warns, is dangerous. They don’t want to admit that they feel incapable and unworthy, so they find external sources of validation—like friends or lovers or possessions. For example, you may derive your self-worth from the attractiveness of your spouse. But this isn’t true self-esteem, Branden contends. Self-esteem ultimately comes from how _you_—not others—view yourself. So self-esteem that comes primarily from others lacks the benefits of true self-esteem. Moreover, Branden warns, it risks making you dependent on how others view you—which would lower your self-esteem even more.

(Shortform note: [Social media has turned over-reliance on external validation into an epidemic](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addiction-and-recovery/201907/stop-seeking-validation-others), leading to low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety in many users. As it becomes easier to validate others and receive validation, people crave it in every aspect of their life—and they’ve grown so attached to other people’s reactions that they can’t recognize how they feel about themselves. To break this cycle, use self-reflection to recognize when you’re seeking validation through social media, and consider taking a break or even deleting your social media accounts in order to learn to rely on your own judgment of yourself.)
