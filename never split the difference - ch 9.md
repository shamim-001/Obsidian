## Chapter 9: How to Bargain

To effectively employ Voss’s techniques, **you need to accurately size up your counterpart so that you can anticipate how they’ll approach you and how you can best respond.**

In this chapter, Voss tells you how to take a comprehensive assessment of the person across the table from you by:

- Exploring the three main types of negotiators
- Teaching you how to plan your negotiating moves and countermoves based on which negotiating style your counterpart uses
- Explaining the Ackerman Model, a strategy for use in monetary negotiations

### The Three Types of Negotiator

Voss identifies three main types of negotiator:

- Givers
- Calculators
- Aggressives

Voss does not say that any one type is better or more effective than any other. They all can work in different situations. But he does say that whatever you are, you shouldn’t project your style of negotiation onto your counterpart—for example, if you’re an Aggressive, you have to adjust your behavior when you’re dealing with a Giver. Voss sees this as another extension of the empathy that’s at the heart of his approach to negotiation—**treat others as they wish to be treated.**

> **Don’t Be a Pushover**
> 
> Some other writers on negotiation do caution that it’s possible to go too far in being accommodating to someone else by meeting their style.
> 
> In _[Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/give-and-take)_ (2014), Adam Grant writes that the biggest risk of being a giver is giving too much of yourself, at your own expense—letting others seize opportunities that should be yours.
> 
> When negotiating, givers often feel empathy for the counterparty, which makes them afraid of being too off-putting—and as a result, they dial down their self-interest. However, Grant does concur with Voss in that the best negotiating strategy is to understand the other person’s objective perspective and interests. By getting a handle on what they really want, Grant argues you can work with your counterpart to find mutually beneficial solutions.

#### Type # 1: Givers

The first type of negotiators identified by Voss are Givers. These are people-pleasers. Voss writes that they value the time spent building a relationship with their counterpart. **Givers tend to be highly sociable and agreeable—but also poor time managers.**

When dealing with a Giver, Voss advises you to focus your open-ended questions on implementation. This is because **they’ll often agree to things that they can’t actually follow through on**, since they’re so eager to make you happy.

Conversely if _you’re_ a Giver, Voss advises 1) don’t sacrifice your reasonable objections because you’re afraid of conflict. Remember, most good decisions are borne of conflict and discomfort. Lean into it and avoid negotiating with yourself. Also, 2) avoid excess chitchat, especially if you’re face-to-face with someone who’s not a Giver. As you’ll see below, Calculators will want to get straight down to the facts, while Aggressives want to be the ones doing all the talking instead of listening to you.

> **Fear of Conflict**
> 
> Voss’s belief that most good decisions are the product of some level of conflict and discomfort has been backed up by other writers. In _[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/1-page-summary)_, Patrick Lencioni writes that fear of conflict is a major reason why working teams fail to implement decisions.
> 
> Lencioni writes that functional teams engage in what he calls “ideological conflict”—passionate disagreements about issues and ideas that do not devolve into personal rivalries and discord. Because they trust each other, members of functional teams feel comfortable expressing their true opinions and publicly disagreeing over important issues. With trust, they know that feedback isn’t meant to damage a person, but rather to improve their performance.
> 
> When there is a fear of conflict, however, these productive disagreements never happen—and as a result, the team is unable to resolve critical issues. Teams that fear conflict don’t tap into the full expertise and experience of their members. When this happens, they’re in danger of making mediocre decisions because they haven’t accounted for all possible angles and viewpoints. Even worse, a team that doesn’t openly discuss disagreements may end up channeling their unspoken conflicts into personal attacks—so that a team of Givers might, by trying too hard to accommodate each other, ironically end up at odds with each other.

#### Type #2: Calculators

Voss describes Calculators as methodological and diligent people. **They want to assess all the facts before committing to a decision.** As a result, they’re fairly unconcerned with time and less likely to be pressured by deadlines.

He warns that Calculators can be uncomfortably distant and cold, because they’re focused more on the results of a negotiation than on forging a human connection with their counterpart. They see _you_ and the negotiation _with you_ as completely separate entities.

When dealing with a Calculator, Voss recommends using clear, unambiguous data to back up your assertions. Don’t ad-lib, and avoid giving them any surprises. Also, don’t ask too many questions—even open-ended questions. Calculators will tend to not answer them until they have all the information they feel they need to respond. Instead, they’ll just treat your questions as just more data to analyze, which will take up a lot of your time.

On the other hand, **if _you’re_ a Calculator, be sure not to cut off your most valuable source of info—your counterpart.** You’ll learn more from creating some empathy and connection with them than you can from all of your external research and number-crunching. Be sure to smile when you speak to put your counterpart at ease and get them to be more forthcoming.

> **How Analysis Paralysis Might SInk Negotiations**
> 
> In _[The Four Tendencies](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-four-tendencies)_, Gretchen Rubin writes that people with highly analytical minds—those committed to logic, information, and efficiency, and intolerant of arbitrary, inefficient, or illogical expectations—often find themselves needing more and more information to answer basic questions, even when they recognize that such excessive information gathering is counterproductive.
> 
> Rubin terms this type of dysfunction “analysis paralysis,” in which someone becomes incapable of making a decision because they keep researching or the research doesn’t clearly point in one direction. Rubin warns that this can have detrimental consequences for someone’s career. If a Calculator easily falls into analysis-paralysis, they won’t be able to make the big decisions necessary to do their job. They’ll also be more likely to do poorly in work environments where people view their excessive probing as challenges to authority or insubordination.

#### Type #3: Aggressives

Voss characterizes Aggressives as being highly achievement-oriented. They want to get things _done_. **They hate wasted time and care a _lot_ about meeting—and beating—deadlines.** They also tend to have a forceful personal style, are more comfortable making threats and issuing demands, and can’t listen to you until they feel _they’ve_ been heard. In short, they’re the classic hard-bargainer, the sharks, the type of adversary that many rookie negotiators fear going up against.

But, according to Voss, you can also use their domineering personalities and need for tangible accomplishments against them. **Aggressives can be especially vulnerable to time pressures, since the biggest defeat to them is making no deal at all**. If you can back them into a corner where they’re facing a deadline, you’ll be in a great position to dictate the terms.

Fundamentally, writes Voss, you need to put an Aggressive at ease and get them feeling in control. He recommends using a mix of labels, reflecting back, and open-ended questions to prompt a “That’s right” from them. This shows them that you see and understand their worldview and gives you credibility in their eyes (without them feeling like they’ve conceded something to you, which can be an unbearable blow to the ego of an Aggressive).

Reflecting back is also particularly effective with Aggressives, writes Voss. They love hearing themselves talk, so hearing _you_ echo what they’re saying will boost their ego and convince them that you’re listening.

Meanwhile, **if _you’re_ an Aggressive, watch your tone and use open-ended questions to make yourself more approachable**. Remember, browbeating your counterpart into concessions can backfire: they might give you a false “Yes” just because they’re intimidated by your forward style and want you to get off their back. As Voss has demonstrated, these kinds of false agreements aren’t worth much, because your counterpart has no intention or desire to actually implement the terms.

> **Use Threats Strategically**
> 
> Voss writes that Aggressives are more prone to using hardball tactics, including threats. Harvard’s Program on Negotiation blog suggests that, while threats can sometimes be counterproductive and only serve to alienate your counterpart, they can also be an effective negotiation tactic if you deploy them strategically.
> 
> In order to determine whether your threat is just empty bluster or something that can actually advance your goals in the negotiation, they recommend [taking the following factors into account](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/how-to-make-wise-threats/):
> 
> - Your emotional state: If you’re issuing threats out of sheer anger or frustration, it’s unlikely to help you make headway in the negotiation. When you’re angry or flustered, your ability to assess information and calculate costs and benefits is highly compromised. You don’t have to be a robot, but don’t let your emotions run the show.
>     
> - The potential for tit-for-tat: Is your threat going to result in a counter-threat by your counterpart, leading to a damaging cycle of mutual escalation? If so, you might want to think twice before issuing it.
>     
> - How you frame your threat: If you present your threat as a purely retaliatory, punitive measure, it’s unlikely to be useful. Strategic threats are about advancing your interests, not simply punishing your counterpart or preventing her from fulfilling her interests. Be sure to frame your threat to make it clear that they will get what they want if you get what you want. For example, if you’re making a threat to walk away from a deal, you can say something like, “If we reach an impasse and I’m left with no choice but to terminate this negotiation, we both lose out on a potentially lucrative deal for both of us. Let’s turn this around and focus on making sure we _both_ get what we want.”
>     

### Know Your Moves (And Your Counterpart’s)

Voss cautions that you need to be prepared before you head into a negotiation—regardless of which type of negotiator you’re dealing with. That means you need to think about your open-ended questions, how you’re going to reflect back, and your labels before you go in. **You may not need a script—but you _do_ need a plan.**

But Voss warns that it’s not enough to just have your _own_ moves thought out in advance. Like a general, you also need to be quick on your feet, anticipate your _counterpart’s_ moves, and formulate in-the-moment tactics for fighting back and countering. At the same time, you have to avoid being too hemmed in and tunnel-visioned by your own plan. If the negotiation is unfolding in a way that your plan didn’t precisely account for, you need to have the mental agility to adapt it on the fly with the changing circumstances.

Below, Voss highlights some specific dodge-and-counterpunch tactics you can use when you’re facing down a tough negotiator.

> **Plot Your Negotiation Roadmap**
> 
> Harvard University’s Program on Negotiation blog [recommends running through a pre-negotiation checklist before you sit down at the table](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/negotiation-preparation-checklist/). While Voss’s preparation guidance tends to focus on scripting specific tactical moves, Harvard’s checklist focuses on more overarching, strategic concerns, including:
> 
> - Knowing clearly what you want to achieve from the negotiation—both long-term and short-term goals.
>     
> - Understanding your greatest strengths and weaknesses.
>     
> - Understanding what your counterpart wants and how you can give it to them (which is why they’re negotiating with you in the first place).
>     
> - Mapping out your priorities: Some of your goals may be secondary or tangential to your main objective. It’s important to know what your highest priorities are, because that will help you figure out what you might be willing to sacrifice and what you absolutely must have.
>     
> - Assessing your BATNA, or best alternative to a negotiated settlement: In other words, what does a no-deal situation look like to you? Is that something you can live with, or must you strike a deal at all costs?
>     

#### Move #1: Dodging Tactics

Dodging tactics (where you’re skillfully deflecting the “punches” of your counterpart) can be best explained with an example. Let’s say you’re looking to sell your house and you think you can get around $250,000 for it. If a prospective buyer comes along and throws you an obvious lowball offer of $175,000, how do you respond?

**Open-ended questions are a great way to say “no” without actually using the word**. In this context, you would say, “The listed price is $250,000. I’m willing to negotiate, but you’re offering less than I paid for it; I’d be losing money. How can you expect me to do that?”

If the first offer is monetary, as in this case, Voss recommends **pivoting to non-monetary terms**. Ask questions like, “Let’s put price aside for now. What _else_ can you offer for this house that would make this a good deal for me?”

(Shortform note: There are always parts of a negotiation that fall outside of direct price haggling that can be used as a sweetener. For example, in _[Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat](https://store.biggerpockets.com/products/buy-rehab-rent-refinance-repeat)_, David Mason Greene writes that offering to pay cash for a house (instead of getting a mortgage loan from a bank) is often enough of a benefit to the seller that they’ll be willing to accept a lower price. When you make a cash offer, it’s much easier and quicker to close the deal than it is when you have to secure financing from a bank or other financial institution (that will inevitably insist on appraisals, inspections, and other time-consuming loan contingencies). If a homeowner is in a rush to sell their house (perhaps because they lost their job or need to move because they got a new job somewhere else in the country), this time-saving can be incredibly valuable and worth the lower price you’re offering. In this way, you can “dodge” some of the seller’s possible objections.)

#### Move #2: Go on the Counterattack

Voss argues that you also need to be prepared to hit back—_without_ getting angry. Remember, even if you’re able to browbeat your counterpart into making big concessions, these will likely end up being hollow victories for you. Like a confession under pain of torture, a concession being under emotional distress is likely to be false and of little strategic value.

Instead, Voss urges the use of a technique psychologists call _strategic umbrage_. This means being genuinely angry (not faking it), but in control of your emotions. **The key to strategic umbrage is getting angry at the _offer_ being made—not the person making it**. If you get an unworkable or frankly insulting offer, you can respond by saying “I see. I’m afraid there are no circumstances that would make what you just proposed work for me” in a displeased—but measured—tone is a good way to leverage a little bit of anger to your advantage.

“I” and “me” statements are also effective, according to Voss, because they put the other side’s focus on _you_ as a person, which triggers their empathy. “I’m sorry, but I can’t do that,” is a great way to hit the pause button on a bad dynamic.

> **The Right Way to Get Mad**
> 
> Many psychologists argue that [anger itself is not a “positive” or “negative” emotion](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_right_way_to_get_angry). When used appropriately, anger can power professional success and fuel personal creativity. Indeed, one study out of the University of Michigan shows that [people who suppress their anger have worse health outcomes](https://news.umich.edu/a-good-fight-may-keep-you-and-your-marriage-healthy/) than those who are able to find healthy outlets to express it. Suppressors had higher instances of bronchitis, heart attacks, and tended to die younger.
> 
> The key is not to suppress or get rid of all anger. Instead, we should strive to harness that anger to serve useful purposes. Much of this comes down to applying your anger to situations where it can actually make a difference.
> 
> If, for example, you’re stuck in traffic, that’s a situation that’s completely beyond your control. Anger is useless in this scenario because it won’t do anything to change the outcome, so in this case, you should work through your anger and dissipate it. But let’s say a coworker took credit for your idea at work and got a commendation from the boss that you feel you really deserved instead. In this situation, some level of anger is rational, and it might actually result in a correction of the situation. Like Voss, psychologists advocating for some expression of anger recommend using a measured, calm tone to express your displeasure, while taking care not to degrade the other person. This would allow you to harness strategic umbrage by being angry but still in control.

#### Know When to Walk

Lastly, you need to be willing to walk. Voss writes that **“no deal” is better than a bad deal**. If you suspect that your counterpart is lying, he says you should terminate the discussion right away. There’s no point in negotiating if you can’t get accurate information from your counterpart or if they’re acting in bad faith.

Even if they’re not lying _per se_, Voss advises you should walk if your counterpart has no _ability_ to follow through on the deal (despite what might be their best intentions). This comes back to implementation: if your counterpart can’t actually pull the trigger because outside forces won’t allow them to act, you have nothing to gain by speaking with them.

However, you should always maintain collaboration with your counterpart: you might need to work with them on some future deal. Avoid emotional escalation if you need to shut down the negotiation and **never look at your counterpart as an enemy.**

(Shortform note: In _[Getting to Yes](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-to-yes/1-page-summary)_, Fisher and Ury argue that the decision to walk away from a negotiation is more about the power imbalance between two parties than it is the unreliability of one of them. While wealth and connections enhance negotiating power, the power of each side also depends on negotiating skill and the strength of their alternative. If one party has a stronger alternative— for instance, the ability to get a better price elsewhere—they have the ability to walk away from an agreement, which gives them leverage. The stronger your BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement), the greater your power. Other power enhancers include a good working relationship, listening skills, and ability to identify the other side’s interests and create mutually satisfying options.)

### Use the Ackerman Model for Negotiation

Voss recommends what he calls the _Ackerman Model_ as a good alternative to traditional, old-school negotiating. Created by ex-CIA operative Mike Ackerman (who later founded a company advising law enforcement on kidnapping situations), this model improves on the traditional offer-counter system because it doesn’t end with you “meeting in the middle.”

(Shortform note: The book presents this in the context of bargaining for a _lower_ price when you’re the buyer. If you’re bargaining for a _higher_ price, as the seller, then invert the process.)

The Ackerman Model follows these six steps:

1. Choose a target price.
2. Offer 65% of your target price.
3. Offer three raises, at 85%, 95%, and finally, 100% of your target price.
4. Say “no” without saying “no” outright.
5. Offer a precise number, strange number.
6. Offer a non-monetary item as well.

#### 1. Choose a Target Price

This should be ambitious, but reasonable. You don’t want to negotiate with yourself and set your target price too high (if you’re the buyer), but you also don’t want to set it so low that your counterpart would never agree to it. Doing some research beforehand will help you set your goal.

(Shortform note: Rather than setting a precise target price as Voss does, [some negotiation experts recommend setting a target price range](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/price-anchoring-101/). This makes you appear more flexible, reasonable, and open to counteroffers, but also helps establish an ambitious opening bid on your terms. If a house is listed in your market for $250,000 you might want to offer a price range from $220,000 to $240,000—less than the seller is asking, but possibly within the zone of acceptability.)

#### 2. Offer 65% of Your Target Price.

Thus, if you’re aiming to pay $100,000, your opening bid should be $65,000. This is a starting bid designed to catch your counterpart off guard. Voss writes that an extreme starting bid like this can also trigger your _own_ sense of loss aversion in a constructive way. By starting with a low offer, you’ll start thinking of anything higher than that as a “loss,” which you’ll work hard to avoid. In reality of course, you’re still well below your target price at this point, so even if you move off your opening bid it’s still a “win” for you. In addition, says Voss, your bid can force your counterpart to reveal their _own_ price limit. If they balk and say something like, “I couldn’t possibly sell for anything less than $75,000,” that means you’ve just forced them to reveal their price floor.

(Shortform note: The Ackerman Model that Voss presents says to simply offer 65% of your asking price if you’re the buyer. The Harvard negotiation blog has a bit more nuanced approach to making first offers. They write that, when making your first offer, [you need to find your reservation point](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/price-anchoring-101/), the point at which the proposed deal on the table holds equal value to the next best alternative—which might be simply walking away. You also need to figure out what this point is for your counterpart as well. Knowing these limits for yourself and your counterpart will help you identify what negotiation experts call the zone of possible agreement—the spectrum of mutually acceptable options for your negotiation.)

#### 3. Make Your Counterparts Negotiate Against Themselves

When they throw you an unacceptable counteroffer, use an open-ended question like “We’ve talked over my fixed costs already. Given that, how can I pay the price you’re asking for this?” Get them to think about how they can solve _your_ problems.

(Shortform note: Much of Voss’s advice with regard to the Ackerman model seems to focus on you making the first offer and driving the subsequent counteroffers in order to put yourself in the driver’s seat and force your counterpart to negotiate against themselves and generally play the game on your terms. Some observers see things a bit differently, however. Other negotiators argue that [making the first offer is a classic example of negotiating against yourself](https://www.inc.com/ken-sterling/avoid-these-2-rookie-negotiation-mistakes-at-all-c.html). While it’s true that Voss says you need to do your research first, making an opening bid without knowing what the offer person really wants often amounts to you voluntarily taking money out of your own pocket. If someone is selling something and you don’t know their asking price, any offer you make could be tantamount to shortchanging yourself before you even start bargaining—like offering $20 for something that the seller would have happily accepted $5 for.)

#### 4. Plan Your Counteroffers

When planning your counteroffers, **use three increases—but each time, you _reduce_ the size of the increase.** For example, Voss recommends countering at first with a number that’s 85% of your target price (a 20 percentage-point jump). Then, you increase it to 95% of your target price (only a 10 percentage-point jump this time). If they’re _still_ not accepting this, then finally you meet them at your full target price (which by this point is a modest 5 percentage-point jump). All of this activates your counterpart’s inclination toward reciprocity. They’ll be inclined to match your raises with concessions of their own.

There’s also great power in the decreasing increments of your offer increases. They **fool your counterpart into thinking that they’re squeezing you for every last penny.** This makes them feel like they’re in control and that they’re earning hard-won concessions from you. Of course, you know that you’re still well _below_ your target price.

(Shortform note: At the Harvard negotiation blog, they write that [offering a rationale for your counteroffers can be an effective tactic](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/dealmaking-daily/how-to-counteroffer-in-business-negotiation/). They identify two kinds of rationales—constraint and disparagement. Constraint rationales usually center around why you can’t afford what your counterpart is offering: “That’s completely outside of my budget.” Disparagement rationales question the legitimacy or fairness of the counterpart’s offer. If you were buying a car, you might say, “This is a used car with 100,000 miles on it and is no longer serviced by the manufacturer. I’m really surprised you’re asking this much for it.” Research from Columbia University showed that [negotiation counterparts were more receptive to constraint rationales](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/researcharchive/articles/25668) and tended to work harder to find common ground with people who used them.)

#### 5. Use a Precise, Non-Round Figure for Your Final Number

This gives it added weight and credibility, as Voss mentioned during the analysis of framing effects. Something like $99,321.94 sounds like a much firmer, more non-negotiable number than $100,000. This will signal to your counterpart that this number is the product of a great deal of calculation and analysis on your part and that, therefore, it can’t be negotiated.

(Shortform note: A paper from Harvard Business School analyzed the effects of round-number offers vs. more “precise” offers in the world of mergers and acquisitions. They found that [offers made at round levels—i.e., $5-per-share—tended to perform worse than offers rounded to the half dollar or quarter](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/16-058_27d73983-3441-4628-906c-10ce5fb7ac47.pdf)—i.e., $4.75- or $4.50-per-share. Specifically, they found that bidders who made round-dollar offers 1) tended to end up paying a higher purchase price, 2) were less likely to complete a deal, and 3) realized lower returns even when they did complete a deal.

#### 6. Throw in a Non-Monetary Item

**Include a non-monetary item along with your final offer to signal that you’re truly at your limit.** By pivoting to something other than money, you’re sending a message to your counterpart that the monetary portion of the negotiation is over and done with and you’re ready to move on to other items.

(Shortform note: Other negotiation writers suggest that you can also experiment with non-monetary items as part of the normal offer-and-counteroffer cycle _before_ you make your final offer. [Doing this gives you valuable room to maneuver and can help you hone in on what your counterpart really values](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/dealmaking-daily/how-to-counteroffer-in-business-negotiation/). If you’re negotiating a renewal on your apartment lease with your landlord, for example, you can make multiple offers to her that vary with regard to the monthly rent and the term of the lease. Seeing how she reacts will tell you a lot about whether she values a) getting the maximum amount of money each month or b) securing reliable tenants.)

(Shortform note: _[Counterterrorism Strategies for Corporations: The Ackerman Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Counterterrorism-Strategies-Corporations-Ackerman-Principles/dp/1591026547)_ offers a more in-depth exploration of Mike Ackerman’s theory of negotiation and how to apply them in the world of international business. Drawing on his decades of CIA experience, Ackerman’s book specifically looks at how CEOs, CFOs, and other officers of global corporations can minimize the threat to their employees from terrorism and organized crime, exploring tactics to prevent and effectively respond to kidnapping, extortion, and hostage-taking.)

#### Negotiating School Tuition: An Ackerman Model Walkthrough

In this example, we will use a parent (Dana) trying to negotiate a lower annual tuition for her daughter’s private high school with the school’s headmaster.

- Dana was paying $25,000 in annual tuition for her daughter to attend a nearby private school. She was dismayed to learn that tuition would be rising to $28,000. Dana loved the school and knew that her daughter was thriving there, but the tuition hike was simply a non-starter.
- So, how did she respond? First, she did her research on tuition for comparable private high schools in the area. Armed with this information, she set a target price for next year’s tuition at $23,500—_less_ than she was already paying!
- When Dana met with the headmaster, she made a point of emphasizing how much her daughter loved the school, how involved she was in extracurricular activities, how devoted the whole family was to the school community, and how much they wished to continue sending their daughter there. However, Dana also drove home the point that there were comparable schools in the area that offered lower tuition rates. **She asked her first open-ended question: “How am I supposed to pay an extra $3,000 in annual tuition?”**
- The headmaster, however, didn’t budge and pointed out that the school was highly regarded by families in the area, and could in fact be charging even _more_ than they were asking Dana.
- Hearing this, Dana responded with her first offer: “I understand that you have a great reputation and could be charging a premium for tuition, but it’s simply outside my price range. **Would $15,275 be reasonable?”**
- The headmaster rejected this figure out of hand, which Dana fully expected. But she wisely avoided getting pulled into a tit-for-tat. Instead, she asked another open-ended question: **“How much does it cost in recruitment expenses to fill a last-minute vacancy when a student’s family pulls out?”**
- The headmaster responded that their average acquisition costs were about $5000 per student, and that sometimes it took time to fill those vacancies. Dana knew she had an opening—she pointedly observed that _not_ reaching an agreement with her meant that the school could potentially be looking at unplanned acquisition costs and foregone tuition for a few months until they found a replacement for her daughter’s spot. Now, **the headmaster was thinking in terms of loss aversion**.
- The headmaster then came back with an offer of $26,000. This time, Dana used a label to say “no” without actually saying it, by telling him, “That offer is very generous, but I still can’t make that work. **It seems like you’d prefer to roll the dice and risk leaving a vacant spot in the program next year than work this out with me.”**
- The headmaster gave Dana the “no” she was looking for by saying, **“No, that’s not the case at all,** we want very much to keep your daughter in our program, but we just can’t offer below market-rate tuition.”
- At last, Dana pulled out her final, non-round number. She told the headmaster, “All right, I see you’re being reasonable and working hard to address my concerns. **The most I can do is $23,237.**”
- The headmaster was impressed with the number. **“You seem very precise about that figure,”** he observed. **“I think we can make that number work.”**
