# Antifragile

## Chapters 23-25: Ethics and Stakes

Chapters 23 and 24 are about ethics and its connection to fragility. Specifically, they discuss modern situations where people are able to split benefit and harm—in other words, fragility and antifragility. Wealthy bankers and business executives, for instance, are often able to rake in great profits for themselves while shunting costs to the less fortunate.

Chapter 25 is the conclusion of this long essay. It starts by restating the thesis: Everything is either helped or harmed by random events and damage. It then goes on to briefly show how every point that we’ve discussed grows out of that original concept.

### Asymmetry in Society

We’ve talked a lot about benefit and harm and how many situations have some of each. The trick, as we’ve said before, is to get yourself into situations where you’re likely to be benefited more than harmed.

Unfortunately, modern society especially makes it possible to give the benefits to one person or group, and the harm to another. The problem is imbalanced agency; some people have the power to make decisions that affect many others, and the others have no choice but to accept the outcomes of those decisions. Taken to the extreme, this imbalanced agency is how we end up with countries that have a handful of billionaires and millions of people in poverty.

When we say _agency_, what we really mean is optionality. The people who have the power are the ones who have all the options and therefore, all the antifragility. They can shunt the fragility onto those who are less powerful, generally the poor and the marginalized.

#### Something to Lose

**The best way to correct this imbalance is by making sure that everyone has something to lose—some kind of fragility that they need to defend against.** Rather than enforcing this principle with complex rules and massive enforcement agencies (remember, size and rigid controls make systems fragile), it could be addressed with simple laws. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi found an ideal solution almost four millennia ago.

One tenet in the Code stated that any injuries or deaths caused from the collapse of a house would also be inflicted on the one who built that house. If the owner of the house died, the builder would be executed; if the owner’s son died, the builder’s son would be executed, and so on.

It might sound brutal to our modern-day sensibilities, but the punishment wasn’t the point. **The point was to give the builder a stake in what he was building.** A craftsman knows his craft better than any government-sponsored team of safety inspectors, so this is the simplest and most effective way to make sure that what he makes is safe and of good quality.

Fat Tony has a more modern take on this issue, seen in his two rules of thumb about flying:

1. Don’t get on a plane until the pilot’s onboard.
2. Make sure there’s a copilot.

The first rule is about avoiding the transfer of fragility—in simpler terms, making sure the pilot has something to lose before getting on the plane yourself. The second rule goes back to redundancy—making sure there’s a backup plan in case something goes wrong anyway.

### Talk Is Cheap

One major source of fragility in our society is that we give a free pass to the talkers: the people who spread ideas but do nothing with them personally. Even if the ideas turn out to be harmful, only the people who act on those ideas face consequences—in other words, they take on the fragility of the situation. **This effect is especially pronounced in the Information Age, where ideas can spread to millions of people almost instantly.**

One extreme example of this transfer of fragility from the talkers to the doers can be seen in the work of New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman. His op-eds about terrorism contributed a bit to the start of the Iraq war in 2003. However, it was other people who faced the consequences of Friedman’s ideas. Friedman himself got to sit safely behind his computer and continue writing.

Many of our systems operate on punishment. For example, someone who drives drunk could face heavy penalties like fines and jail time. If the charges are severe enough, that person might never be allowed to drive again. However, for some reason, the Thomas Friedmans of the world don’t face any consequences at all.

The talkers have another advantage as well: They get the benefit of hindsight. While prediction is a notoriously unreliable art, _post_diction (talking after an event has happened) makes one look infallible. It gives the chance to cherry-pick events or outright lie about them.

Given the chance, an armchair expert will tell you that he saw it coming (whatever _it_ was). Furthermore, he’ll say that given his great track record, you’d be foolish not to listen to everything he has to say in the future. Of course, any future predictions he makes will cause the usual fragility.

Our modern preoccupation with knowledge plays into this source of societal fragility. Knowledge means talk; academics, journalists, and everyday people can just _talk_ about their ideas and their predictions, and there’s little (if any) need to back up their statements with evidence. **Winning a debate nowadays isn’t about being correct, it’s about being charismatic.** The weight of an argument is measured in Facebook likes.

Like the builder in Hammurabi’s time, everyone should have a stake in what they put into the world, whether that’s concrete goods or words on paper. For example, if you write an article calling for war, you should be the first one volunteering to fight it.

### The Fragility of the Stock Market

We’ve talked about journalists and talkers transferring fragility onto those who put their ideas into practice. **However, there’s no single greater transferer of fragility than the stock market.** The U.S. stock market in particular gives all the benefit to corporate executives and managers, while shunting all the harm to the taxpayers.

The problem is that the corporate types have no stakes. This seems counterintuitive, since they work for and represent the companies in question, but we’ve seen time and again how major corporations get bailed out (with taxpayer money) anytime the market takes a serious hit.

As a result, the corporations—and especially their high-ranking executives—become highly antifragile. They benefit directly from random events and shocks to the market. Even if something so significant happens that the company lets an executive go, you can be sure she’ll get a hefty severance package. **They get all of the upside and none of the downside.**

That’s because the downside falls to the ordinary folk, the ones who don’t have so many options available. The U.S. stock market has cost retirees trillions of dollars, while corporate managers have gotten richer by hundreds of billions over the same time period. The banks are even worse—they’ve lost more money than they’ve ever made, but the cost falls to the taxpayer while the CEOs rake in enormous bonuses.

The reason for all this is that the largest corporations and banks have disproportionate control over the government through their lobbyists. With the state more or less in their pockets, they have free reign to take our money with their products and then take it again when the stock market falls.

**Clearly, something needs to change to give bankers and executives some stakes in their own companies.** Back in the 1300s, Catalonia had a tradition of beheading bankers whose banks failed; however, modern people may find that distasteful. Still, in some countries like Brazil, bankers are held personally liable for any losses up to the value of their own assets. If U.S. bankers were held to similar standards, perhaps the market wouldn’t crash so often.

#### Legality vs. Ethics

As it stands, the problem is that these transfers of fragility from executives and bankers to the common people are perfectly legal (though certainly not ethical). Insiders can take advantage of the system’s enormous size and complexity to exploit weaknesses and loopholes—remember, size and complexity increase fragility.

For example, a previous vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank—now employed by a private bank—came up with a way to get around the usual limits on investment insurance by breaking up a large investment into numerous different accounts. This would benefit his clients, and therefore himself, while putting the risk on taxpayers who might have to bail out the bank again.

It was legal within the rules of the system, but by no means ethical. To make matters worse, this same person used the prestige of his former position to argue _against_ the government increasing the insurance limit on individuals.

Again, these ethical issues arise because of stakes. In this case, it’s actually worse than the thinkers who have no stake in their ideas. This former vice chairman had an inverse stake: He had nothing to lose but a lot to gain.

**However, you’ll often see justifications after the fact about why these actions were ethical.** With the options available through hindsight and cherry-picking, it’s easy to fit selfish actions to a narrative about the common good, or what have you. This is simply applying the benefits of optionality to ethics.

We see this commonly from American gun lobbyists, for example, who claim that widespread ownership of guns improves public safety and benefits the country (despite all evidence to the contrary). More generally, people often fit their beliefs to their actions rather than their actions to their beliefs.

**Another legal-but-unethical argument that comes up a lot is “everyone’s doing it.”** This is especially common in academia: Teachers have to teach based on the textbooks and the curriculum, even if they know what they’re teaching isn’t accurate.

Then students take that incorrect knowledge into their professional lives, where companies expect them to use the same theories and rules that everyone else uses—again, even when those ideas are wrong and dangerous. That happens a lot in economics, with many of the results we’ve previously discussed in this section.

**In short: Legal doesn’t mean ethical, and people often put their ethics aside when they have something to gain.** However, those people might use the options granted by arguing after the fact to make their actions _seem_ ethical. One of the most common after-the-fact arguments is that it’s natural to want to make money, as if that somehow excuses the harm done to others in the pursuit of wealth.

**As in many other areas, we should progress by negation.** If we removed these sources of fragility—that is, the huge and complex organizations managed by people with nothing to lose and a lot to gain—we’d create a much better system.

### Conclusion

**Everything that exists is either helped or harmed by randomness and uncertainty.** Every idea and example in the preceding essay is derived from that one precept. If there are cases that don’t seem to flow from it, that’s only because nature often operates at a level that baffles our limited understanding—incidentally, the same reason why our predictions and models fail so often.

Systems that are large, rigidly controlled, and grounded in theories and predictions are fragile. They break easily under stress, and often cause harm to the people who rely on them. Large corporations, governments, and the stock market are all fragile.

Systems that grow and evolve naturally—systems that are alive, whether literally or metaphorically—are antifragile. Rather than breaking, they’re strengthened by random shocks that eliminate the weak parts and allow the strong parts to grow.

Antifragile systems tend to be smaller, like the loose collection of cantons that make up the government of Switzerland. While they may cause some apparent instability on a small scale, on a large scale they’re much more stable and less prone to collapse than large systems with top-down controls.

Perhaps the best way to seek antifragility is progress through negation; rather than trying to seek out new, antifragile ideas and practices, we can start by simply eliminating the fragile ones.

Modern society has attempted to take the risk out of life and, in doing so, has accidentally introduced a great deal more. We should remember the barbell model—a combination of protection and risk-taking in our endeavors—and reject our modern ideas of perfect efficiency and prediction.

**Risk and variation are the essence of life.** Food only tastes good because of hunger; joy is meaningless without sadness; results are worthless without effort. Finally, ethics only exist when there’s some personal risk to holding them. The best way to check whether you’re still alive is to ask yourself if you like variety—are you made stronger by random events, or do they break you?
