## Introduction

In _Quiet_, author Susan Cain argues that **whether you’re an introvert or extrovert affects every aspect of your life**. Your temperament influences your choice of partner, friends, career, and lifestyle, as well as how those choices play out—for instance, how you advance in your career or handle differences in relationships. It even plays a role in daily activities, such as exercise and sleep, as well as your pursuit of passions, challenges, and downtime.

Scientists and writers dating back to the Romans, Greeks, and the Bible have studied introversion and extroversion extensively. They’ve even found that some animals can be identified as introverts or extroverts. The two personality types working together can create effective partnerships like, for instance, that of Martin Luther King Jr. (an extrovert) and Rosa Parks (an introvert). Her quiet defiance in refusing to give up her bus seat made her an appealing symbol King could use to rally others to the cause of integration.

**A third to a half of Americans are introverts, according to studies**. They tend to be quiet and thoughtful and prefer less stimulation. There’s a good chance that you’re an introvert yourself—or you live, work, or are friends with an introvert. You may not realize when you’re associating with introverts, however, because many of them act like extroverts when necessary, either consciously or unconsciously. Some people don’t realize they’re actually introverts until a change in their lives, such as a divorce or layoff, allows them to live in a way that aligns with their true nature.

### A Nation of Extroverts

The U.S. is one of the most extroverted nations, according to studies, and our society is skewed toward favoring extroverts. **Our culture, including schools, social institutions, and workplaces, celebrates and is shaped around an “extrovert ideal”**—a belief that the ideal personality type is someone who is highly sociable, self-assured, and enjoys the spotlight.

We typically think of an extrovert as a person of action, who takes risks and readily makes decisions. He or she is gregarious and flourishes as part of a team or as its leader. While we claim to value independence and individuality (qualities of introverts), the only independent type we seem to celebrate is the loner who comes up with technological innovations and gets rich. Anyone else with introvert tendencies is suspect.

**Society often views introversion, which can encompass sensitivity and shyness, as an undesirable personality trait that should be suppressed or changed**. Because extroversion has become the norm to which everyone must conform, introverts are left feeling devalued because of an innate quality.

**Research shows we rate people more positively when they have qualities we associate with extroverts**. For instance, talkative people are considered more intelligent, attractive, interesting, and likely to make better friends. People who talk faster are rated as more capable than those who talk slower. In groups, those who talk the most are seen as smarter than those who are quiet.

### A Society Built for Extroverts

**In the U.S., we’ve built our society and values almost entirely around extroversion**. In school systems, for example, this is reflected in the way classrooms are organized and taught: Desks are arranged to facilitate group projects and high levels of interaction and activity. Most teachers believe students should be extroverts.

Television programs aimed at children feature extroverted rock-star personalities who relish the spotlight—for instance, Hannah Montana, Carly Shay of _iCarly_, and Sid the Science Kid, a program aimed at preschoolers. They’re a big departure from the quieter Cindy Bradys and Opie Taylors of the past, who were unremarkable kids doing ordinary things.

In the workplace, teamwork, open offices, and “people skills” are prized. **We’re expected to engage in relentless self-promotion to develop and promote our personal “brand.”** To advance in many careers, extroversion usually is essential. Even in professions often seen as hospitable to introverts, being an extrovert still helps you get ahead. For example, the scientists who are the most self-confident and brash often get the most funding.

**Introverts, as both children and adults, are constantly pushed to be more outgoing**.

Parents and teachers urge children to “come out of their shell” and be more sociable and to participate more in class. Adults are chided for being “in their head” too much, or they’re seen as disengaged at work when they want to think rather than react off the cuff.

### Unappreciated Strengths

Yet introverts have many underappreciated strengths, including empathy, a strong social conscience, persistence, concentration, creativity, and solving complex problems. A more balanced approach that takes advantage of the strengths of both personality types and offsets each one’s weaknesses would serve society better.

Quiet thinkers are responsible for many discoveries and artistic achievements, including:

- The theories of gravity and relativity of Einstein
- _Nocturne_ by Chopin
- _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ and _Animal Farm_ by George Orwell
- _The Cat in the Hat_ by Dr. Seuss
- Charlie Brown by Charles M. Schulz
- _Harry Potter_ by J.K. Rowling

Other introverts notable for their achievements include Eleanor Roosevelt, Al Gore, Warren Buffett, Gandhi, and Rosa Parks.

> **Rosa Parks: A Quiet Revolutionary**
> 
> Civil rights icon Rosa Parks was an introvert who abhorred the spotlight. Yet her quiet, one-word response to being told to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and a national movement against racial segregation in public facilities.
> 
> On December 1, 1955, after a long day of ironing in the basement of the Montgomery Fair department store, Parks boarded a bus for home and sat down in the first row of the Colored section. When the driver ordered her to give up her seat, she simply said, “No.”
> 
> The driver threatened to have her arrested, and she replied, “You may do that.” A police officer arrived and asked her why she wouldn’t move and she asked him in turn, “Why do you all push us around?” “I don’t know,” he said, “but the law is the law …” and he arrested her.
> 
> The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. recognized that Parks’s quiet, unassuming nature plus her integrity and character made her a sympathetic and credible plaintiff for the lawsuit that ended bus segregation by order of the Supreme Court a year later. While King spoke for and promoted her, she remained humble and shunned the limelight. Yet she had taken considerable risk—she was fired from her job and received death threats for years.
> 
> News coverage of the Supreme Court order didn’t even mention Parks—the newspapers praised King and carried photos of boycott leaders standing in front of buses. Meanwhile, Parks was at home, caring for her mother.
> 
> In her brief autobiography _Quiet Strength_, published in 2010, she again resisted the opportunity to claim any credit, instead citing the many who died in the civil rights struggle.

**Introverts’ unique strengths, like Rosa Parks’s quiet determination, can be advantages in many situations**. But, steeped in the extrovert ideal, they may not recognize their own capabilities. For instance, author Susan Cain, an introvert and former Wall Street lawyer, recounts an instance early in her legal career, in which she was called upon to renegotiate the terms of a loan for an important client. While she was nervous initially, her low-key introvert approach of refusing to be adversarial, asking questions, listening, and focusing on solutions helped both sides reach an agreement. She was so successful that she received an offer of more work from her client and a job offer from her opponent.

### What Is Introversion?

What differentiates introverts from extroverts? The definition is still not completely agreed upon, and has changed over the years.

Psychologist Carl Jung’s 1921 book _Personality Types_ popularized the terms as key to one’s personality. **He described introverts as internally focused on thoughts and feelings and extroverts as externally focused on people and activities**. Introverts focus on analyzing events while extroverts want to be part of events. Introverts draw energy from being alone while extroverts are energized by interacting with others.

The Myers-Briggs personality test used by many organizations is based on Jung’s theories of introversion and extroversion. But today there’s no universally accepted definition based on objective criteria.

Some personality psychologists belong to the “Big Five” school, believing that personality consists of five core traits: extroversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. They define introversion by qualities introverts _lack_—assertiveness, sociability—rather than by their attributes.

Some think Jung’s ideas are outdated, while others still tout them. But many psychological researchers agree on several key points:

- **Introverts and extroverts require different levels of external stimulation** to function effectively. Introverts need less outside stimulation—for instance, they prefer to work alone, spend free time alone, or visit with just one or two friends. Extroverts need a lot of stimulation, typically from social activities and busy environments.
- **Introverts and extroverts have different work styles**. Introverts focus on one task at a time, work methodically, and have a great ability to concentrate. They’re not motivated by external rewards. Extroverts jump into jobs quickly, multitask, take risks, and make quick decisions. They may be motivated by factors such as competition and status.
- **They have different styles of interaction**. Introverts can be sociable but soon tire of being in large groups or parties. They listen, think before speaking, and may express themselves better in writing. They dislike conflict and small talk. Extroverts are gregarious, assertive, dominant, and comfortable with conflict. They don’t like to be alone.

**Introverts are stereotyped as recluses or loners who dislike people**. This may be true of some introverts, but most are as friendly as anyone. **Another stereotype is that introverts are shy**. Although some introverts may be shy, like T.S. Eliot, there are key differences between introversion and shyness. Shy people dislike social situations because they’re afraid of embarrassment, while introverts dislike social situations because they’re too stimulating.

It’s actually possible to be a shy extrovert, like Barbra Streisand, who has stage fright, or an introvert who’s not shy, like Bill Gates. To further complicate things, an introvert who’s not speaking because she’s overstimulated and an extrovert who’s not speaking due to shyness can both come across as shy.

**Introverts also may be “highly sensitive,” which is a psychological term meaning more apt to respond with strong feelings** to something—for instance, to be moved by music or a sad story or be upset by violence. Researchers don’t know how many introverts are highly sensitive, but they’ve determined that 70% of highly sensitive people are introverts.

### Are You an Introvert?

If you’re not sure whether you’re an introvert, you can get an idea by considering the extent to which the following traits, which many introverts share, apply to you (this isn’t a scientifically valid personality assessment):

- You prefer one-to-one conversations.
- You enjoy time alone.
- You don’t like small talk but enjoy in-depth conversations about topics that interest you.
- You prefer to work alone on one thing at a time, and dislike interruptions.
- You’re a good listener.
- You prefer to think first rather than speaking off the cuff.
- You’re bothered by conflict.
- You’re exhausted by interacting with a lot of people.

The more items you agree with, the more introverted you may be. However, people usually fall on a spectrum between introverted and extroverted and no one is introverted or extroverted in all circumstances. Your introversion or extroversion also is affected by your personal experiences and other personality traits, such as sensitivity.

If you’re an introvert, some aspects of this book will apply to you while others won’t. Rather than establishing strict definitions, this book explores broad questions, such as whether introverts can be leaders, whether they should ever act like extroverts, and whether introversion/extroversion is biologically or socially determined.

What the author hopes you’ll gain from the book is a sense of entitlement to be yourself, which can be life-changing.
