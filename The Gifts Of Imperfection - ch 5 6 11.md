## Chapters 5-6, 11: Develop Inner Strength

In this chapter, we’ll explore three more of Brown’s strategies for living Wholeheartedly. These strategies all involve **developing inner strength:** in other words, developing the fortitude necessary to fight unhealthy mental and emotional processes and adopt healthy ones instead. The strategies are:

- Combating perfectionism
- Building resilience
- Practicing stillness and calm

### Combat Perfectionism

Brown’s first strategy for developing inner strength is **fighting perfectionism**. Brown notes that people often frame perfectionism as a positive thing: for instance, “trying to be the best version of yourself.” However, she believes that perfectionism is actually a damaging process that’s about **trying to control people’s perceptions of you.** It’s an attempt to gain approval and acceptance from others—and, crucially, **avoid being shamed or judged by them**—by hiding your flaws and projecting the image of being perfect.

> **The Psychological Definition of Perfectionism**
> 
> In the world of psychological research, the definition of perfectionism is somewhat complex. The widely supported work of Gordon Flett and Paul Hewitt—two prominent perfectionism researchers—contends that [there are actually three different types of perfectionism](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.1494&rep=rep1&type=pdf):
> 
> - Perfectionism directed at the self (putting pressure on yourself to be perfect)
>     
> - Perfectionism directed at others (putting pressure on others to be perfect)
>     
> - Perfectionism borne of social pressure (others putting pressure on you to be perfect—or even you just _thinking_ that others expect you to be perfect)
>     
> 
> Flett and Hewitt’s work has also found that **perfectionism in any of its forms can be dangerous to mental and emotional wellbeing—**an idea we’ll discuss next.

#### The Dangers of Perfectionism

**Brown argues that perfectionism is dangerous to our well-being and sense of worth because it’s founded on completely unrealistic expectations.** No matter how hard you try, you’re never going to be perfect or even successfully _appear_ to be perfect: As Brown notes, none of us can hide our mistakes and imperfections all of the time.

However, according to Brown, the perfectionist mindset won’t concede that it sets unrealistic standards. Instead, it makes you believe that you didn’t manage to project perfection because _you weren’t good enough to meet its standards_—for instance, you didn’t hide your flaws well enough. This attitude causes you to blame, shame, and judge yourself. As Brown points out, **you end up experiencing the painful thoughts and emotions that you thought perfectionism would repel.**

> **Other Negative Effects of Perfectionism**
> 
> As well as causing you to shame, blame, and judge yourself, perfectionism can have various other negative effects. Research has linked it to [increased vulnerability to depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169326/) and [eating disorders](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.8328&rep=rep1&type=pdf), among other mental health conditions. Perfectionism may even be linked to suicide risk: Research conducted in Alaska found that [almost 60% of suicide victims were perfectionists](http://dhss.alaska.gov/SuicidePrevention/Documents/pdfs_sspc/sspcfollowback2-07.pdf) (according to people who knew them).
> 
> **Perfectionism can create specific difficulties for people in leadership roles.** According to Robert Greene in _[The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-laws-of-human-nature)_, [perfectionist leaders struggle because they want to control everything (and everyone)](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-laws-of-human-nature/law-13) that’s within their sphere of influence (presumably so that they can ensure all work meets their standard of “perfection”). They refuse to delegate, create bottlenecks (since everything must be checked over by them), and feel unable to depend on their colleagues. Ultimately, they burn out, and they usually fail in their role.

#### How to Fight Perfectionism

It’s clear that perfectionism is highly damaging—so, **how can we fight it?** Brown outlines various strategies for overcoming perfectionism, some of which are developed further than others. Overall, we can synthesize her ideas into two practices:

**1) Be kind to yourself.** According to Brown, showing yourself compassion can help you to embrace your imperfections, rather than punish yourself for them or work desperately to hide them. She also claims that engaging in positive self-talk—talk that is encouraging and kind about yourself and your flaws, rather than critical and judgmental—can be instrumental in staving off perfectionism.

(Shortform note: Engaging in compassionate self-talk can do more than just help you fight perfectionism. According to Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves in their book _[Emotional Intelligence 2.0](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence-2-0)_, positive self-talk can also [help you to overcome challenging times and keep your mood positive day-to-day.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence-2-0/chapter-6))

**2) Alter your perception of shame and judgment.** First, accept that you, like everyone else in the world, will always be vulnerable to these negative emotions. Brown doesn’t fully explain why accepting this fact will help to combat perfection, but she implies that doing so takes away perfectionism’s power. After all, perfectionism is rooted in the idea that you can avoid these emotions. Once you realize that you can’t, it becomes pointless.

Second, focus on developing your shame resilience. Brown argues that having strong shame resilience will help you to _accept_ your alleged “imperfections” rather than hide them because you won’t feel ashamed of them anymore.

> **Another Way to Combat Perfectionism: Group Treatment**
> 
> On top of Brown’s recommendations, research has identified another successful approach to overcoming perfectionism: **engaging in group psychological treatment.** One study of perfectionist university students found that [engaging in group counseling based around fighting perfectionism significantly reduced participating students’ harmful perfectionism](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10942-007-0064-3), as well as their levels of anxiety and depression. Another study of adults also found that group therapy [reduced perfectionism, anxiety, depression, and stress](https://espace.curtin.edu.au/bitstream/handle/20.500.11937/27696/189613_73240_Egan_S__Steele_A___etal._Group_CBT_for_perfectionism_2013.pdf?sequence=2), with the positive results of the therapy still persisting three months after treatment concluded.
> 
> Even group therapy that isn’t solely focused on addressing perfectionism may be beneficial for perfectionists. One study found that group treatment for social phobia not only reduced participants’ social anxiety, but [also had the side effect of reducing some types of perfectionism.](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/40219163/Changes_in_perfectionism_following_cogni20151120-10264-t6rvxp.pdf?1448052111=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DChanges_in_perfectionism_following_cogni.pdf&Expires=1617274187&Signature=TnX47IsljYYko8OoYW4flSQpiwmZrdMP12EBY5-4nckszyuYLP0n-Tr~gMj3RcUpcxYzO9jXv4JWk5gSbakTyxs9sQSOsiiMn48K4V2Sspqtjygfc7b3i7bauI8mY4OEnGDZskpfBShkW247kgvcJSm15Q6HI6lcGeOT7ImjDO-o4ybhwyCEu4cYx6N0Fo0tVLo-l3WCnDGQIOxeY2VVEVzBWfi5H5WV560Wez016CG3AzmPN8GNs59SsZmgzq1Y-5D9-E0mA4byXJ4iq2lpqAOktsunmiXzs8N22hNdj-dubMozAFqLQ683q2dtMAoS0OkswqkYaa3Mw-gXSNPc4Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)

### Build Resilience

Brown’s next strategy for living Wholeheartedly is **building resilience**. Brown’s research found that people who lived Wholeheartedly _all_ had some resilience: They’d experienced struggles but had found a way to work through them.

(Shortform note: Brown’s discussion of resilience suggests that **if you lack resilience, living Wholeheartedly may be more difficult.** You may be more vulnerable to threats to your worthiness. Any trauma or struggle can negatively impact how you feel about yourself. If you can't learn from and rise above those struggles, you're in danger of feeling that you're not worthy of a different, happier life.)

In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown presents four strategies for generating resilience. While she presents the first three strategies as being sub-strategies of, or at least linked to, the fourth, most important strategy—embracing spirituality—it’s at times unclear how each practice connects to the theme of spirituality. For this reason, we’re going to discuss all four strategies separately:

#### Strategy #1: Develop Hope

You might think that hope is an emotion: the feeling of wanting something to happen. However, Brown, citing the research of the late psychologist C. R. Snyder, argues that this isn’t true. She supports Snyder’s assertion that **hope is actually a way of thinking.** According to Snyder, [hope is a powerful combination of self-belief, goal-setting, and motivation](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/growplus/files/2020/02/Hope-Synder-paper.pdf)—in other words, deciding what you want to achieve, believing you can achieve it, and having the grit to keep trying to achieve it, even in the face of challenges.

According to Brown, if we don’t cultivate hope, we run the risk of feeling powerless: like we can’t achieve our dreams or improve our lives. **It’s hard to be resilient if you feel that you can’t change your life for the better.**

> **The Other Benefits of Hope**
> 
> Developing a hopeful mindset won’t just help you to build resilience: **Studies have shown that hopefulness can have various health benefits, too.** For instance, being hopeful may help you to live a healthier lifestyle. One study found that college students with high levels of hope were more likely to [limit their fat intake and exercise regularly](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2011/00000035/00000004/art00003). Another study found that [hopeful people are more likely to adopt positive weight management behaviors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jhn.12057), such as meal planning and being mindful of meal portion size.
> 
> Furthermore, a review of the literature into hope and physical health notes that [hope may be linked to](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=W3s7DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT271&dq=hope+and+physical+health+rasmussen&ots=fgckhjN2As&sig=DAiefWRDylKr2-ExHMh7Q6BhH6s#v=onepage&q=hope%20and%20physical%20health%20rasmussen&f=false):
> 
> - Having a higher pain tolerance
>     
> - Being able to emotionally cope with a cancer diagnosis
>     
> - Accepting and coping with injury or disability
>     
> 
> Just as having hope can benefit physical health, research suggests that **hopelessness can present a severe risk to health.** One study found that in men, high hopelessness was linked to negative health outcomes such as [cancer, heart attacks, and violent death](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/51446/Everson%20SA%2C%20Hopelessness%20and%20risk%20of%20mortality%2C%201996.pdf?sequence=1). Furthermore, research has linked hopelessness in college students to [over-consumption of alcohol and smoking](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2011/00000035/00000004/art00003).

#### Strategy #2: Critically Analyze Societal Messages That Harm Resilience

As Brown notes, we constantly encounter messages in the media about what we “should” do—for example, how we should look and the products we should buy. These messages aren’t necessarily valid or realistic. For instance, a common societal message, often projected by the beauty industry, is that to be attractive, you _must_ have clear skin and perfectly-styled hair—but this isn’t true.

However, Brown argues that **if you encounter these societal expectations often enough, you may start believing that they _are_ valid.** Furthermore, you might start to judge and shame yourself for not meeting them—which will harm your resilience.

To avoid this damage to your resilience, Brown suggests **practicing critical awareness. This means evaluating the media you consume and the expectations that it communicates:** Are those expectations _really_ valid or realistic? Would following them _actually_ make your life better? Questioning the expectations will help you to realize that they’re unreasonable and that you shouldn’t try to live up to them. By keeping this in mind, you can protect your worthiness—and, consequently, your resilience.

> **Which Media Gives Messages That We Should Critically Analyze?**
> 
> In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown highlights television commercials as a major source of harmful societal messages that we must critically analyze. For example, many commercials feature extremely slim people who are held up as models of beauty, perpetuating the expectation that to be thin, you must be beautiful—a message that warrants analysis, since it’s arguably neither valid nor realistic.
> 
> However, commercials aren’t the only source of these harmful messages. In recent years, **[social media has also become a leading source of damaging societal expectations](https://childmind.org/article/social-media-and-self-doubt/) that we must view critically.** For instance, there are concerns that content on Instagram—a platform that [hit 1 billion monthly users in 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/instagram-1-billion-users/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJD2LxHXcCRgBXFd2Q0LX8UUr1e12cMIicEQiVljC4C-IHZKXL81N_8TOEezN_lHDRpKMPzEYBOkZMcoUHMrx1PXTDt9Akm4kVqGny6NGcybCQ3GwVJ8QzHNZ63ml28YHMC11Zwn2AeoYYNb3HOx8utzBwPMlORy_7wWMp0LbLGq)—promotes various standards of living that are highly unrealistic, but that users feel they must adhere to. These include unrealistic beauty standards.
> 
> On Instagram, [users regularly “filter” and otherwise edit their photos](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a33264141/face-filters-mental-health-effect/) to make themselves look slimmer, change the size of their facial features, and remove skin blemishes. These edited posts are often held up as a standard of beauty, despite the fact that they don’t reflect reality. In fact, these standards are so unrealistic that [many women would need to have plastic surgery (or at least continue to heavily edit their photos) to achieve them](http://networkconference.netstudies.org/2020Curtin/2020/05/14/faking-faces-instagrams-role-in-propagating-unrealistic-beauty-standards/). Such unrealistic and invalid standards are a prime target for critical analysis: Should we _really_ be holding ourselves to standards that no person could naturally achieve?

#### Strategy #3: Refuse to Numb Negative Emotions

According to Brown, numbing is a common response to uncomfortable negative emotions. We’re afraid of feeling these emotions, so we try to “take the edge off” them—for instance, by consuming alcohol. The problem with this approach is that **numbing leads to _positive_ emotions being dulled as well as negative ones—and being unable to feel positive emotions can harm your resilience.** As Brown notes, one thing that helps us to get through tough times is recalling happier times. If you’re unable to fully experience positive emotions, you won't have as much positivity to draw on when you’re struggling.

Instead of giving in to the temptation of numbing, Brown suggests forcing yourself to feel and address your negative emotions. For example, if you’re feeling sad, allow yourself to cry and fully explore the root of your sadness: where it's come from, and why it’s so powerful.

(Shortform note: While _feeling_ and _understanding_ your negative emotions may help you to process them healthily, some authors believe that _dwelling_ on these emotions—in other words, thinking about and analyzing them for too long—may be counterproductive. For instance, Daniel Goleman argues that [extensively ruminating on difficult emotions like anger and anxiety can actually increase and extend your emotional pain](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2), rather than helping you to manage it. In other words, addressing negative emotions may be a delicate balance: Don’t ignore or numb your feelings, but don’t let them consume you for too long, either.)

#### Strategy #4: Embrace Spirituality

During her research, Brown found that having a deep sense of spirituality is one of the most crucial factors in cultivating resilience. She defines spirituality as **recognizing the existence of a higher power that connects us all**. (The “higher power” in this equation could be a religious power, such a god, but it doesn’t have to be.)

According to Brown, embracing spirituality increases resilience in a number of ways. For instance, she argues that the feeling of connection to others and a higher power that spirituality brings makes overcoming tough times feel easier. Being resilient is less challenging if you feel you’re not alone.

(Shortform note: Embracing spirituality or religion may have more benefits to mental health than just increasing resilience. According to a report by UK charity The Mental Health Foundation, [research links spirituality to decreased levels of depression and anxiety](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/impact-spirituality.pdf). Spiritual beliefs may also aid recovery from trauma. However, the report notes that the picture isn’t clear-cut: Research indicates that some forms of spirituality, such as strict religious observance, can trigger or worsen mental health issues.)

### Practice Stillness and Calm to Fight Anxiety

Brown’s next strategy for developing inner strength and living Wholeheartedly is **fighting anxiety.** According to Brown’s research, people who live Wholeheartedly aren’t necessarily _free_ from anxiety. Instead, they maintain an awareness of their anxiety while simultaneously looking for ways to reduce its impact.

(Shortform note: Learning how to cope with anxiety is arguably becoming increasingly important as more and more people report feeling anxious. A study published in 2020 found that [rates of anxiety increased in the United States between 2008 and 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7441973/), particularly among young people. Another, earlier study also found that [rates of anxiety increased in both young adults and children from the 1950s to the 1990s.](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.79.6.1007))

#### Practicing Stillness and Calm

In Brown’s view (and from her personal experience), an effective way to reduce the impact of anxiety is to practice stillness and calm. Let’s look at each practice individually.

##### Practicing Stillness

**According to Brown, practicing stillness means taking the time to be still and quiet.** This might take the form of praying, meditating, or just having some reflective alone time. Brown emphasizes that being still doesn’t mean clearing your mind of _all_ thoughts—a daunting prospect for many of us. Instead, it’s about creating some quiet “space” in your mind which you can use to reflect and relax.

Brown acknowledges that practicing stillness may be uncomfortable at first. **Many of us actively avoid being still** because having a constant background noise of thoughts in our minds helps to drown out uncomfortable, anxious thoughts—for instance, thoughts about our flaws or things we’re dissatisfied with. However, Brown notes that our anxiety will never recede if we don’t bring these thoughts to the surface and address them—and forcing ourselves to be still is an important part of this process.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that various types of stillness—such as [meditation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0272735885900169), [prayer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20391859/), and [mindfulness practice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0260691714002226)—can reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and even depression. To learn more about mindfulness—an [increasingly popular](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/envy/201811/why-has-mindfulness-become-so-popular) stillness practice—read our guide to _[Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindfulness-in-plain-english)_, which presents mindfulness as [a way to achieve mental peace and tranquility](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindfulness-in-plain-english/chapter-1).)

##### Practicing Calm

Brown conceives practicing calm as a more complex process than being still. In her view, a major aspect of calmness is **stopping yourself from acting on strong, reactionary emotions**, particularly strong negative emotions such as anger or fear—something many of us are prone to doing when we’re in a stressful or unexpected situation. Brown notes that reactionary responses often make things worse, not least because we haven’t thought our response through.

For example, if a colleague unexpectedly criticizes your work, your visceral reaction might be to criticize them right back or challenge them rudely. The results of this reaction will probably be overwhelmingly negative: The colleague is likely to get angry at you, which will create a conflict-ridden, anxiety-inducing situation. Meanwhile, if you curb your instant emotional reaction and respond to your colleague in a measured way—for instance, asking them how they’ve come to this conclusion about your work and what you might do to improve it—you’ll keep the situation calm.

So, how can you stop yourself from being reactionary? Brown suggests taking a moment to breathe before you react. This gives you the time to think before you act and analyze whether acting on your emotions is the right approach.

> **Other Ways to Keep Calm**
> 
> Brown isn’t alone in suggesting that pausing before you react can help you stay calm. Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves, authors of _[Emotional Intelligence 2.0](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence-2-0)_, also recommend this practice, although they conceive it as **[counting to 10 before you react](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence-2-0/chapter-6)**, rather than pausing only briefly.

>

> Here are some other soothing strategies to use during stressful or anxiety-inducing situations:
> 
> - Daniel Goleman, author of _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence)_, recommends [challenging your anxious thoughts](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2) to promote calmness. For instance, if anxiety makes you think, “this situation is a disaster,” you might challenge the thought by asking, “is this situation _really_ that bad? Will I even remember it in a week, a month, or a year? How might this situation actually turn out _well_?”
>     
> - Approaching a loved one and asking for a hug may also help you to keep calm. In _[The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score)_, Bessel van der Kolk argues that [physical touch such as hugging has a soothing effect](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/chapter-8), helping even victims of trauma to feel protected and calm.
>     
> - In _[The Power of Positive Thinking](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking)_, Norman Vincent Peale suggests that [repeating calming words](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking/chapter-2)—such as “serenity” or “tranquility”—can promote inner peace and calmness. (In contrast, repeatedly saying or thinking anxious statements, such as “this is a disaster,” will only make you _more_ anxious.)
