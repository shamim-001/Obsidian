## Law #10: People Are Conflicted, Especially About Authority Figures

In the previous two laws, we learned how to manage human nature when belonging to a group. Now, we’ll learn how to manage human nature when it comes to leaders and authority.

**By nature, humans have conflicted emotions about almost everything.** However, people tend not to admit these conflicts to themselves, or even notice them in others, because they’re confusing and require extensive self-reflection to untangle. This is for three reasons:

1. Right from childhood, we experienced the conflicting desires of independence from and dependence on our parents.
2. Pure, unmixed emotions are so powerful they can be overwhelming and frightening. We have to dilute them with other emotions to feel in control.
3. Our goals and directions are constantly shifting because we’re a painful mix of changing moods, masks, and contradictory traits.

**We especially have conflicted feelings about authority figures because they remind us of the conflicting feelings we experienced toward our parents.** Like our parents, we depend on authority figures—without them, we don’t have people to learn from, we fall victim to short-term thinking (more on this in Law #12: People Are Bad at Long-Term Thinking), and there’s nothing to rebel against, so we don’t learn to think outside the box. Additionally, in leaderless groups, everyone’s individual needs pull the group in so many different directions that the group doesn’t have purpose and never makes progress.

We also, however, crave independence from authority figures. **We want to disassociate from leaders because they make us feel inferior and envious, or because we fear they might manipulate their power** to achieve their own ends, rather than what’s best for the group.

**These conflicted feelings cause us to act fickle towards authority figures.** For example, in older times, if something went wrong under a king’s rule, he could be executed, and people would celebrate at these events. Today’s leaders are “executed” via losing elections or public shaming. Additionally, when it comes to established leaders, this fickleness can come from a fear of corruption—the longer someone’s in power, the greater chance they have of being corrupted.

In this law, we’ll learn how to manage toxic types and make people like us.

### Manage Toxic Types: Leaders and Authority Figures

Authority and leadership aren’t synonymous. **Authority comes from striving for a higher purpose, which is a fundamental human need.** People need purpose to help them guide their behavior for two reasons:

- Unlike animals, we don’t have instincts that tell us what to do. We have consciousness and a lot of choices.
- We’re aware of our insignificance in the larger world and we want to feel connected to something.

Leadership, on the other hand, is just holding a position of power.

**It’s possible for someone with little authority to end up in a leadership position,** especially today, because many people, even those in charge, associate negative connotations with authority and avoid using it.

- For example, some parents strive to be their children’s older friends rather than someone who tells them what to do.

Therefore, **it’s important to assess leaders before choosing to join their groups or follow them.** Otherwise, we might decide to follow someone who doesn’t actually have a vision, regurgitates a groups’ desires, or is susceptible to the collective emotions of the group.

To learn to recognize and measure authority, think about your parents, teachers, mentors, bosses, and leaders in society and reflect on how much of an effect they’ve had on you, others, and the groups they lead. Try to figure out where they get (or don’t get) their authority from in specific moments.

- For example, people who have to use force to get others to follow them don’t have that much genuine authority.

#### Become Your Own Authority

If you can’t find a leader you want to follow, **you can also meet or partly meet your need for guidance by developing personal authority. This involves finding your purpose** and using it, instead of or in an addition to an outside authority figure, to guide your actions. (Note that purposes aren’t the same as ego.)

In general, **our purpose is to find our own niche in the ecosystem of humanity so that we contribute to the world’s diversity.** The world we live in today was created by others fulfilling their purposes in the past. (For example, the physics equations we learn in school were developed by ancient astronomers.) All of us have the responsibility to contribute something to society.

Our more specific purposes are determined by our unique talents and interests. **All purposes are fine as long as they’re personal and internal.**

- (Shortform example: If you’re good at music, your specific purpose might be to create compositions that people will enjoy, which will fill your general purpose of contributing to society.)

Once we find our purpose, we’ll know how to behave when confronted with decisions and opportunities and reap the following benefits:

- Our choices are unified, so they’re more powerful.
- We’re using our inherent talents and character, so we feel energetic and are more effective. (Purpose might initially seem like it will lead to a life of constant work and tedious practice, but it’s actually lack of purpose that turns our lives gray because feeling like we’ve wasted our time and lives is unpleasant.)
- We can focus and overcome adversity.

Additionally, when following our purposes, some of our negative, conflicting emotions will be changed into something productive or disappear entirely:

**Boredom.** If we aren’t doing something that matches our interest and engages us, we become chronically bored. We might try to distract ourselves with vacations or new hobbies, but nothing holds our interest for long due to the law of diminishing returns. Once we have a purpose, however, practicing skills is motivating because we know they’ll lead us somewhere concrete.

- For example, if your purpose is to play the piano, you’ll have to practice a lot. This practice might get boring for someone who wasn’t actually interested in piano, but because you like it, it’s fun and easy to focus. Even in low moments, you can carry on because you know practicing will lead you somewhere in particular; it’s not aimless like practicing something you’ll never use.

**Insecurity.** If we don’t feel like we’re working towards anything, we don’t have goals and can’t accomplish anything of value. We become sensitive to criticism, which makes it even harder to learn and improve. Once we have purpose, however, we know that we’re realizing our potential and have accomplishments to demonstrate we’re on the right path. Our doubts are about our work, not ourselves, and we’re able to tell the difference between helpful and unhelpful criticism.

**Anxiety and stress.** Lacking purpose, we were never forced to achieve a goal and spent most of our time avoiding pain. When we encounter unavoidable, stressful situations we don’t know how to cope with stress and suffer. However, once we have purpose, we regularly experience anxiety and stress in small doses as we achieve smaller goals that are related to our larger purpose. We learn to manage pressure and can channel it into motivation.

**Depression.** Without purpose, we don’t have any sense that our life has meaning, and we feel empty. However, once we have purpose, we’re happier because we know we’re living up to our potential and contributing to the good of humanity. We’ll still have low moments, but armed with purpose, these moments can be used for reflection.

##### Finding Your Purpose

**Most people’s purposes don’t come to them naturally.** While a few people might successfully identify them in childhood or have a eureka moment later in life, **most people have to spend a fair amount of time reflecting to discover them.**

There are four strategies for finding your purpose. The goal of all of them is to look beyond the influences of the people you know and society to find out what you uniquely are interested in.

**Strategy #1: Identify your brain’s favorite type of intelligence.** According to psychologist Howard Gardner, everyone’s brain has an affinity for a different type of intelligence, such as intelligence in math, music, or physical activity. When you’re doing one of these activities and it feels natural, that’s your intelligence type.

**Strategy #2: Listen to your body.** When you stray from your purpose or take a wrong turn, you’ll feel uncomfortable. The path is broad and there’s room for exploring, but it’s always headed in the same general direction. (The path can also include many facets—for example, some people find their purpose in combining fields of study. Leonardo da Vinci mastered both art and science.)

**Strategy #3: Identify your natural abilities.** Reflect on what activities feel easy and natural for you and what activities you’re happy to practice for long periods. You also probably won’t be overly bothered by criticism when doing these activities.

**Strategy #4: Identify your primal inclinations,** which are things you’re attracted to. Think back to what interested and fascinated you when you were a child. You probably won’t know why you were drawn to this activity (if you were pushed towards something by your parents, then it's not primal). Often, you’ll have been drawn to something after watching someone else do it.

- For example, when chemist Marie Curie was four, she walked into her father's office, saw lab equipment, and felt drawn to it.

If you’re just starting your career, explore your inclinations widely. For example, if you’re called to science, try biology, chemistry, physics, and so on. If you have experience already, don’t make a drastic career change. Instead, find a way to direct the skills you already have towards your purpose.

##### Pursuing Your Purpose

Once you’re determined your purpose, you can use the following strategies to pursue it:

**Strategy #1: Transform pain and negativity into motivators.** To be successful, you need skills, but skill acquisition can be painful because it requires many hours of practice, honest assessment of your abilities, criticism, and overcoming obstacles.

- For example, Thomas Edison didn’t like being ridiculed, so to encourage fast skill development, he’d talk to journalists about his upcoming inventions to give himself a deadline—if his invention didn’t come out shortly after being announced, he’d be mocked.

**Strategy #2: Spend time with purposeful people and avoid purposeless ones.** Because humans mirror the emotions of others, physically surround yourself with people who know their purpose so that their drive will wear off on you. These people are easy to recognize: The young ones seem fated for success, and the older ones have a resume of accomplishments. Additionally, purposeful people might be able to offer advice.

**Strategy #3: Break projects into smaller steps.** A purpose is by nature a long-term, overarching goal, but it can seem so large and far away that it’s overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. Create smaller, shorter goals that work towards the overall goal to avoid being overwhelmed. Think about the overall goal every once in a while to recalibrate your path and inspire you.

**Strategy #4: Create peak experiences**, which are experiences during which you transcend the everyday and become aware that you have greater potential than you realize. To do this:

- **Eliminate distractions.** It’s hard to have a peak experience when you’re interrupted, so create lots of time in which to think.
- **Create ideal conditions.** Start projects and develop skills so that your mind will be open to ideas.
- **Focus on your work itself, not the reward associated with it.** If you’re thinking about the fame you’ll attract from your work, you’ll never be able to connect to the work itself.

For example, to create peak experiences, when actor Ingrid Bergman got a new role, she’d obsess over it. She didn’t think about how much money was making. Instead, she spoke to the crew about the writing and dialogue, isolated herself so she could connect with the role and forget about everything else in her life.

##### Avoiding False Purposes

These days, finding purpose is harder than it used to be. In the past, people didn’t have so many choices—there weren’t that many jobs and roles. If they didn’t know what direction to take, there were mentors and advisors who could help.

Today, however, the amount of choices is overwhelming. A lot of traditional support systems, such as religion or, are disappearing and as a result, guidance on behavior, such as conventions or taboos, is also disappearing. As a result, some people:

- **Don’t find their purpose.** There are plenty of things that can get in the way of finding purpose: others encouraging us to do other things or criticizing our choices, frustration with work, anxiety, or burnout. This failure to find purpose often happens in two ways:
    - **Embracing the freedom of choice.** People with this attitude try a variety of things, don’t make commitments, and don’t take advice from authority. As a result, they never become experts at anything and don’t learn to focus or compromise.
    - **Creating stability.** People with this attitude quickly choose a career that’s practical and relationships that are safe. After years of this, people tend to feel bored by their existing situation and want to start embracing the freedom of choice in midlife.
- **Pursue a false purpose.** False purposes are external purposes that don’t help us find our place in the world. They’re easier to achieve than real purposes but ultimately lead downward. For example, joining a cult is a false purpose.

If we can avoid the most common false purposes, we’ll be steered toward real purposes instead. Here are the common ones:

**False purpose #1: Finding pleasure**. When we choose some form of pleasure as our purpose (eating, videogames, and so on), it won’t ultimately satisfy us. We experience diminishing returns and can become addicted.

**False purpose #2: Microcauses and groups.** These movements and cults typically don’t have any concrete strategies to reach their goals, which are vague and tend to revolve around venting and getting rid of something rather than achieving something. For example, a group might want to get rid of a different group they envy or hate.

**False purpose #3: Income and status.** Often, the desire for income or status is related to wanting to feel superior. Superiority isn’t a concrete benchmark, so no matter how successful we are, we’re never satisfied and keep searching, which can make us depressed. (The best way to get lasting income and status is actually to follow your purpose because this will attract success.)

**False purpose #4: Fame.** Fame, like income and status, is a way of feeling superior to others. Due to the rise in social media, there’s a lot of competition for attention and it’s hard to maintain. (The best way to get lasting success, as with income and status, is to follow your purpose.)

**False purpose #5: Skepticism.** Skepticism is the feeling that life has _no_ purpose and includes ideas like all politicians are corrupt and no matter what we do, the world is doomed, so we may as well do nothing. Skepticism is a way of hiding fear of failure and is a form of laziness.

### Make People Like You: Establish Authority as a Leader

There are several strategies for gaining authority, and they’re effective regardless of where you are in your life—if you’re not yet in a leadership position, the strategies will make you seem destined for one. If you’re already a leader, they’ll help you strengthen your position.

**Strategy #1: Develop goals.** Understand that your responsibility as a leader is to guide the group towards goals that are in everyone’s best interests. If you don’t do this, your followers will feel disconnected and the group’s unity will fracture. People will work slower, form factions, become passive-aggressive, or lose respect. This slows down the group’s progress towards the vision.

**Strategy #2: Plan for the long-term.** Most people can only think about the short term (see Law #13 for more information), so if you can elevate your thoughts and think further ahead, you’ll be able to predict the future and people will trust you. Once you have a vision, create a path to get there. Don’t waver if people doubt you, but be prepared to adapt the path as necessary.

- For example, when 10,000 Greek mercenaries became trapped in Persia, writer Xenophon came up with a plan that would take years to execute but that would eventually get them out.

**Strategy #3: Prioritize the group.** When people realize you’re working towards the greater good of the group, they’ll be more likely to give you attention and follow you.

**Strategy #4: Lead by example.** Work harder than anyone else, meet the highest standards, make sacrifices, and be accountable. This will encourage others to do the same. Start leading by example as early as possible—if you try to do it too late, it will look like a ploy.

**Strategy #5: Set a precedent for toughness during your first impression.** When people break rules or slack off, punish them. You can show your other sides later, but if you show too much softness up front, people will think you’re weak.

**Strategy #6: Be authentic.** Everyone’s authority style is different because everyone has different strengths and characters, but there are some authority archetypes that everyone fits into. If you can act in accordance with whichever archetype you most identify with, followers will see you as a natural, fated for the job rather than someone who just wants power. Here are the archetypes:

- Saviors hate injustice and want to save people from it.
- Creators like to start new things and progress.
- Visionaries subvert the conventions of their fields.
- Bloodhounds hate lies and want to find the truth.
- Fixers want to fix problems.
- Helpers want to help people find fulfillment and connection.
- Instructors encourage people to do things and help them learn from the results.

**Strategy #7: Develop empathy.** We need to use empathy to connect with individuals and get them to feel what we’re feeling (reciprocal respect, for example), or alert ourselves to their feelings.

**Strategy #8: Don’t be entitled.** Entitlement makes us lazy, self-absorbed, and delusional. Instead of being entitled, leaders have to _earn_ their followers’ support. (Leaders are especially susceptible to entitlement because followers regularly hide their true emotions so the leader will like them. This masking makes it harder for leaders to notice ambivalence or even secret resentments that could lead to a coup.)

**Strategy #9: Make yourself appear mysterious and complex.** You might do this by sending mixed signals, being strategic with your presence and absence, using silence strategically, and being accountable without over apologizing. This will create an aura of mystery and people will be drawn to you. (For more on this, see Law #15: People Want What They Don’t Have). Don’t be too contradictory, though, or people will think you’re unstable.

**Strategy #10: Never take anything away from people.** Prioritize maintaining resources so you never have to take them from anyone. If the group needs to give something up, such as money or privileges, to achieve its ends, give it up yourself first, and try to make the shortage temporary.

**Strategy #11: Don’t break your promises.** If you promise people something new and don’t deliver it, people will feel like you’re taking it from them even though they've never had it before.

**Strategy #12: Remember that people hide their emotions.** If you’re in charge of people, they likely won’t feel comfortable showing their true emotions, so assess their actions instead.

**Strategy #13: Weed out bad apples.** There are some inherently negative people who will only ever take away from, rather than augment, the group. Identify them as soon as possible, and either kick them out of the group, or put them in a position where they can’t corrupt anyone else.

**Strategy #14: Adapt with time.** The longer you’re in a leadership position, the more danger there is that you’ll start to feel entitled to the position and become more conservative. Maintain your empathy and keep doing all of the above strategies as younger people challenge you.

In addition to these strategies, you may occasionally have to employ a motivational speech, force or punishment, or reward.

No matter how good your vision or empathy, people will always be fickle towards leaders. But if you do a good job of applying these strategies and people trust you, **when you make mistakes, you’ll be forgiven more quickly because people don’t want you to step down, or they'll be lost.**

#### Create a Healthy Group Dynamic

Establishing your authority is only the first step to becoming a likable enough leader to get things done. Your next job is to **create a healthy group dynamic that pushes all members towards cooperation, open-mindedness, and achievement.** Groups with these healthy dynamics improve society.

There are six strategies for creating a healthy group dynamic. (They’re harder to implement with older groups that are more set in their ways, but it can be done. Be patient and make sure you don’t get overpowered by the existing culture.)

**Strategy #1: Clarify the group’s purpose.** When a group doesn’t have an overall direction, members get confused about what they should be feeling and working towards, and start to prioritize their individual needs rather than the group’s. Therefore, it’s important to clearly define purpose.

- For example, money and success are byproducts, not purposes, so define the real purpose (anything positive that strives for excellence) that will garner money and success.

It’s also important to keep reminding the group of the purpose—they tend to forget over time, especially when they have success.

**Strategy #2: Create a strong leadership team.** As the overall leader, you need to save your mental energy and focus for the big picture. If you micromanage, you’ll confuse the purpose. Put together a team of trustworthy, good-spirited leaders to whom you can delegate tasks. When choosing team members, prioritize their characters and competence. Pick people who are good at the things you're not, and pick a diverse group.

**Strategy #3: Never isolate yourself.** Don’t ask (or allow) your leadership team to filter information. While you do have a lot to keep track of as a leader and can’t get bogged down in details, you need to have a realistic idea of reality because you’ll make better decisions when you know the whole picture. Make it clear that anyone can talk to anyone in the hierarchy and that talking about failure isn’t off-limits. Don’t appear to prefer a certain source of information or idea. Bring in outside experts. Finally, make sure to explain decisions to your group.

- For example, to keep in the loop, Napoleon Bonaparte had people throughout the chain of command send him short reports. This let him get information from foot soldiers as well as field marshals, which gave him diverse perspectives.

**Strategy #4: Be fair.** Treat all members the same. If someone isn’t pulling their weight, kick them out of the group. If something needs to be done, you do it too. This will help avoid envy.

**Strategy #5: Spark the contagious emotion.** Since people in groups are susceptible to feeling the emotions of others, especially the leader’s, feel whatever you want the group to feel and this will spread. Resolution and openness are always good options. Confidence can be productive _if_ it comes from demonstrated accomplishments; otherwise, it can turn into grandiosity.

- For example, basketball coach Phil Jackson wanted his players to be calm so that they could focus on their strategies and recover quickly from mistakes, so before games, he always acted calm himself.

**Strategy #6: Test the group.** You need to know how much you can ask of your group, so to find this limit, apply pressure, such as giving them an unusually short deadline or difficult project. See who can handle the pressure and who can’t. It’s fine to have a few people—but only a few—who can’t manage pressure, if they have redeeming qualities.

After each challenge, the group will be stronger and should be able to handle new crises and obstacles.

> **Extended Example: Elizabeth I**
> 
> Elizabeth I was very aware that people feel conflicting emotions and from her first public appearance, she used the above strategies to gain authority and make people like her.
> 
> When Elizabeth I was crowned as a young woman, she had no political experience, and her country was in debt and embroiled in religious conflict. She did have the throne, but **instead of feeling entitled to power, she worked to earn her subjects’ respect.** During her coronation procession, she showed different, authentic sides of herself, such as her ability to listen, affection for her subjects, and down-to-earth way of speaking. This helped her and the public connect.
> 
> She also worked hard to earn her councilors’ respect. On her first day as ruler, she held a meeting with all her councilors and showed that she was an expert in the country’s finances—in fact, she knew more than they did—and that her goal was to make England prosper. **She regularly worked past midnight, which impressed her ministers.**
> 
> One of her ministers, Sir William Cecil, admired her intelligence but didn’t think she was fit to rule because she was a woman. He planned to convince her to marry someone who could rule in her place. Elizabeth knew this would be bad for the country. If she married a foreign prince, he’d put his own country’s interests first. **Instead of giving in, she prioritized the group’s (England’s) best interests** and outmaneuvered Cecil by strategically starting marriage negotiations with leaders of other countries—if the Spanish got aggressive, she’d go speak to the French, and fearing an English-French alliance, Spain would retreat. By the time Cecil realized what was happening, he had to admit that she’d proved she would be a better ruler than anyone she could marry.
> 
> **When Elizabeth I made her one mistake**—not immediately executing the traitor Mary, Queen of Scots—**the country forgave her because she had such a good track record.**
