## Part 1: People Have Unrealistic Self-Images | Intro: What Is Self-Image?

**Attention is a fundamental human need that motivates almost all human behavior.** For example, some people who don’t get enough attention turn to the spotlight of crime. However, **while everyone wants constant attention, it’s a limited resource**—everyone has to spread their attention among all the people they know and interact with. We need attention in two ways:

- **Physical.** We need eye contact and for people to look at us to confirm that we exist.
- **Psychological.** We need high-quality attention to maintain our self-worth.

While we can’t always control how much physical attention we get, we have come up with a way to cope with a psychological attention deficit—we create (usually unconsciously) **a self-image or self-opinion, which is an internal conception of ourselves that we can use to give ourselves our _own_ attention.** When we need more attention, have low self-esteem, or feel bad about ourselves, we can turn inward and admire our vision of ourselves.

Understanding, assessing, and validating people’s self-images is a large part of applying the laws in Part 1.

### What Do Self-Images Look Like?

**Self-images are rose-tinted versions of what we’re like in reality—we tend to boost our positive qualities and minimize our negative ones.** The earliest versions of our self-images, developed between the ages of two and five, tend to have the qualities we admire in our parents. For example, if our mother is loving, our self-image tends to be loving too.

**However, we can only edit our self-images to a certain extent—if our self-image is too different from what we’re really like, other people will notice and tell us, and then we’ll be full of self-doubt.**

Almost everyone’s self-image includes the following traits:

**1. They believe they have free will.** Whenever people do something, they believe they’ve chosen to do it. In reality, they might have been manipulated into action—for example, by peer pressure—but they so prefer to believe in their autonomy that they fool themselves. In cases where they can’t deny that they’ve been coerced—such as following orders—they either resent the coercion or decide they’re _choosing_ to do the action they’re being forced to do.

**2. They believe they’re smart.** Almost everyone believes they’re intelligent in some way. They might admit that they’re not a genius like Einstein, but they’re proud of their street smarts, common sense, manual skills, and so on. No one wants to believe they’re stupid or gullible.

**3. They believe they’re good.** People like to think that they treat others well, support causes, and act collaboratively, and if they clash with others, they think of it as “tough love.”

- For example, many people who donate money want their names publicly displayed on a sponsor list so everyone can see how good they are.

**People additionally have self-opinions about their specific insecurities, which usually come from childhood.** Most of these self-opinions include superiority. For example, if someone thinks of herself as independent, she’ll tend to think that being independent is a positive trait and that her independence levels are superior to others’.

### Low Self-Opinion or No Self-Opinion

**A few people have low self-opinion because their childhood insecurity is related to being successful or good.** A low self-opinion is just as strong as a positive one—people who think they’re mean or unworthy are relieved when this opinion is confirmed by a bad thing happening to them.

There are also **people who never properly develop a self-image. These people usually had parents who didn’t encourage them to be independent or unique,** and without this encouragement, it’s difficult to create a self-image that feels realistic. Parents can stall the development of self-image by being:

- **Self-absorbed.** The parents don’t pay enough attention to the child’s attempts at independence.
- **Enmeshing.** The parents pay too much attention to their child—they’re so involved in her life she can’t establish a sense of self.
    - For example, enmeshing parents might not allow their children to play with others and develop identities separate from the parents.

### The Importance of Self-Opinion

Our self-opinion is enormously important to our personalities. **It affects our thinking and values to the point where we reinterpret the truth so that it doesn’t clash with our sense of self.**

- For example, if you see yourself as tough and you’re Christian, you’ll look for stories in the Bible that confirm toughness is valuable.
