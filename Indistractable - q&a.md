## Shortform Exclusive: Q&A With Nir Eyal

We recently chatted with Nir Eyal, author of _[Hooked](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/hooked)_ and _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable)_, to discuss his work, becoming indistractable, and how to better manage our changing and increasingly distracting world.

### Part 1: The Book

**Shortform: Many reader reviews of this book note that a few years ago, you wrote _Hooked_—which discusses creating a product that people come back to—and then followed up with _Indistractable._ Some of these reviewers suggest that _Indistractable_ is a sort of “antidote” to _Hooked_. What are your thoughts on that?**

**Nir Eyal:** I’ve heard this trope a lot, and I can’t say I didn’t court it, because I made the books look very similar. However, I didn’t title _Indistractable_ as “_Unhooked”_—even though my publisher wanted to—because I didn’t want to negate anything in _Hooked._

Why? Because _Hooked_ is about how to build good habits in customers’ lives. It’s not written for social media companies. There are no case studies of social media companies. The only case study in the entire book is of the Bible app. What I wanted to show with _Hooked_ is that we can steal the secrets of the social media companies to make education products, fitness products, or connecting with Scripture habit-forming—that we can use these techniques for _good_.

But, we also have all sorts of bad habits that aren’t associated with technology: not exercising when we say we will, not eating right, all kinds of distractions. So, _Indistractable_ is about how we break _bad_ habits, and _Hooked_ is about how we build _good_ habits—they’re not about the same habits. We can have our cake and eat it too: We can have good tech habits, using apps that help us exercise and meditate and live better lives, _and_ break the bad habits we don’t want.

**Shortform: One idea from the book that’s surprising is how much of distraction is _internal._ It’s not really about technology—if you’re feeling discomfort, you’ll reach for whatever is nearby. If technology isn’t nearby, procrastination might manifest as flipping through books.**

**Nir Eyal:** And it always has, right? The Facebook and Twitter and Instagram of a generation ago was television and radio and the novel. Exactly what we’re saying today about technology is the same thing people were saying about novels, and the bicycle, and all of these technologies. We always think they’re leading to terrible behavior and mind control and addiction—and of course, in the course of time, we laugh at those assertions.

**Shortform: The chapter that discussed the way the _printing press_ was seen as something evil and leading people astray was so interesting—it’s hard to believe people were worried about it, but 50 years from now we might be saying the same thing about Facebook.**

**Nir Eyal:** Right, and it’s not that there aren’t negative consequences, of course. There’s that Paul Virilio quote: “When you invent the ship, you invent the shipwreck.” So clearly, there are negative implications. Not everything that happens on social media is good. What I want to do is give us the good parts while fixing the bad parts. So that’s what _Indistractable_ is all about—why would we wait for the tech companies to fix this problem for us, when there’s so much we can do right now for ourselves?

**Shortform: And the tech companies aren’t motivated to stop the problem—they’re getting money from it. And that brings up my next question: Tech use as a distraction is so pervasive and, as you discuss in the book, so normalized. So there are probably many people who think the way they use tech is perfectly fine, but don’t realize they’re missing small, important moments. You had this moment with your daughter—she asked you a question and you didn’t hear her because you were distracted by your phone. This caused a sort of “aha moment” where you realized what you were missing and set out on your indistractable journey. Not everybody has had that moment to reveal their need for indistractability—is there any way that someone can “test” themselves and become more aware of how distracted they really are?**

**Nir Eyal:** As you mentioned earlier, distraction is not just in our technologies…we just haven’t had much time to adapt to the downsides of [technology]. I think the question is: Are you as honest with yourself as you are with other people? I think, by and large, most people are pretty honest. They wouldn’t tell a bald-faced lie to their loved ones. We know being called a liar is a terrible put-down. We would never want to be accused of lying to someone. And yet, most of us, me more than anyone, lie to ourselves every day. I wouldn’t lie to my child or my good friend, but I would lie to myself. So really what the book is about is _personal integrity_. When nobody’s looking, do you keep your commitment to yourself? If you say you’re going to exercise or work on this project at work or be fully present with the people around you, do you do it? Or, do you do something else?

That’s what it’s all about: the difference between traction and _dis_traction. It’s not about using or not using technology, per se—it’s about doing what you want to do with your time. If what you want to do with your time is play video games all day, no problem. I’m not going to tell you not to if that’s what _you_ want to do with your time.

> "Really what the book is about is personal integrity. When nobody's looking, do you keep your commitment to yourself?"

**Shortform: So how could someone stop lying to themselves? Do you think tracking what they do all day could spark one of these aha moments like the one you had? Or is it just not possible to _create_ a similar moment of realization?**

**Nir Eyal:** I don’t think there’s any way to become indistractable _without deciding what you want to do with your time_. One of the most important mantras of the book is that you can't call something a distraction unless you know what it’s distracting you _from_.

I talk to so many people who tell me, “The world is so distracting! Here’s why can’t focus or do this or that” and give every excuse in the book—distracted, underprivileged, their boss, their kids, their this, their that. But when you look at their calendar, you say, “What did you get distracted _from_, exactly? What was it that you intended to do that you didn’t do?” Their calendar is blank.

So you _have_ to decide in advance how you want to spend your time. **The difference between traction and distraction is _intent,_ forethought.** If you [try to decide] in the moment, you’ll lose because you’ll rationalize: “Sure, I meant to do that, it was kind of important.” No! That's a distraction because it’s not what you planned to do with your time in advance.

> "You have to decide in advance how you want to spend your time. The difference between traction and distraction is intent, forethought."

**Shortform: So when you decide what you want to do and then try to do it, there are going to be slip-ups—you’re going to get distracted, you’re not going to do what you said you were going to do. And here, you discuss the key aspect of self-compassion: forgiving yourself and trying again, because beating yourself up will only create discomfort that causes further distraction. This makes sense to me with short-term slip-ups, but I think there’s currently a lot of underlying—and hard to pinpoint—anxiety and discomfort—that’s _repeatedly_ pushing people into distracted behaviors. How do you suggest continuing self-compassion in times like this, when people are repeatedly getting off-track but can’t necessarily pinpoint the reasons why?**

**Nir Eyal:** Self-compassion is not the _solution_—self-compassion is an overarching _attitude_. So self-compassion will not make you indistractable...What will make you indistractable is learning from what happened, what got you distracted, and doing something today to prevent it from happening again in the future.

This is the difference between someone who’s distractable and someone who’s indistractable. Being indistractable doesn’t mean you _never_ get distracted. That’s impossible. Everyone gets distracted from time to time. Even I get distracted from time to time. The difference is, I don’t let myself _keep_ getting distracted again and again. Paolo Cohelo has a wonderful quote—he says, “A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.” How many times can we keep getting distracted by the same shit? Facebook, again? Email, again? The news, again? How many times do we keep getting distracted before we say, “Wait a minute, I'm noticing this is happening more than once.” This is not a problem of, “people just can’t stop.” Of course, they can stop if they pause for a moment to think and say, “What is the _problem_?”

Every distraction only has three potential causes: It’s an internal trigger, an external trigger, or a planning problem. That’s it. Every single time. Use the principles in the book: “Okay, I got distracted once. Shame on you, distraction, for tricking me. What am I going to do _now_ to make sure it doesn’t happen again?”

- **Was it a feeling?** 90% of the time it’s those pesky internal triggers: boredom, uncertainty, fatigue, loneliness, anxiety, stress. 90% of the time it’s an uncomfortable feeling...and the inability to deal with discomfort. But if we _know that_, we can say, “Okay, next time I feel stress or anxiety or loneliness, I’ve got an arrow in my quiver that’s going to be ready for me to pull out as soon as I feel that discomfort.” The 10-minute rule, reimagining the task, reimagining the trigger, reimagining your temperament—all these techniques in that most important, critical chapter around mastering internal triggers need to be ready at our side.
- **Was it an external trigger?** That's super easy. An external trigger is if your phone buzzed or beeped or booped. Why does it keep doing that? At some point, it’s time to just turn [the triggers] off. Is Zuckerberg going to reach into your phone and turn notifications back on? No! Again, how many times can we keep getting distracted by the same shit? Turn it off!
- **Was it a planning problem?** This is when you plan your time and say, “I needed an hour and a half, but I only allotted an hour.” Okay, next time allocate an hour and a half. Or, “I planned this amount of time for traffic, but it took more time than that.” No problem—next time, budget your time differently. That’s how we fix the planning problem.

So there is no distraction we can’t overcome if we plan ahead...the most important mantra in the book is that the antidote to impulsiveness is forethought. Distraction is a problem of impulse control. At the end of the day, that’s all it is. In the moment, we do something that later we’re going to regret because of an impulse. If it happens once, shame on distraction. If it happens more than once, shame on me because I didn’t do something to prevent it.

**Shortform: Right, and there’s so much _internal_ discomfort so it makes sense that people are getting off track—but your self-compassion is about saying, “_That’s fine, but…_” There are a lot of tools for reducing the discomfort. There’s no way to get rid of the anxiety swirling around right now, but there are plenty of ways to plan for it...**

**Nir Eyal:** And deal with it. The goal shouldn’t be to squash those emotions. One of the things I rally against is this idea that feeling bad is bad. We know that the research literature tells us that trying to _escape_ discomfort and thinking that you _shouldn’t_ feel these feelings actually makes it worse. It makes us enter into a rumination loop.

Of course, the self-help industry tells people, “You’re supposed to be happy all the time. You’re not supposed to feel bad, ever.” That’s ridiculous. What we have to do is _use_ that discomfort as rocket fuel to make us better. So when we feel stress we can either say: “I need to stop feeling stressed, let me go watch Netflix, or go take a drink, or just scroll Facebook for a minute,” which are acts of distraction or escape from discomfort. Or, we can say: “This stress must signal to me that this is really important to me. This is my body rising to the challenge.”

It’s about changing the conversation to stop buying into this myth that feeling bad is bad. Feeling bad is _not_ bad. Feelings are signals that we can interpret however we want and respond to in a way that serves us, as opposed to us serving them.

> "The self-help industry tells people, 'You're supposed to be happy all the time. You're not supposed to feel bad, ever.' That's ridiculous. What we have to do is use that discomfort as rocket fuel to make us better...we can say: 'This stress must signal to me that this is really important to me. This is my body rising to the challenge.'"

### Part 2: Eyal’s Personal Experiences

**Shortform: In your experience of becoming indistractable, did you encounter people who were dismissive or who pushed back against your new way of doing things?**

**Nir Eyal:** I guess the biggest objection was something to the effect of, “Well, it’s not always easy to do that.” That was probably the biggest concern. I’m curious actually what you’ve heard?

**Shortform: A common one is in regards to the timeboxed schedule: the response that, “Well, that’s not how the day goes. There are always unexpected things that are going to happen.” Or, “It seems inconvenient for others if your plan of what the day’s going to look like is different from what they want to do.”**

**Nir Eyal:** That is a common one, but I think there’s the misperception that your entire day needs to be what we call “reflective work” rather than “reactive work.” What I advocate for is this: If your job requires you to be reactive—for example, if you’re a call center employee, your job is to sit at a desk and react and answer the phone if it rings—you need to react.

_All_ of our jobs require some sort of reactive work, whether it’s our boss needing something, email, Slack notifications—and that’s fine. The problem is, most people spend their _entire day_ doing reactive work and they allocate no time to reflective work—the kind of work you do that requires you to work without distraction. Creative work, strategizing, planning, thinking—all of these things require you to work without distraction.

Unless you’re a 100% reactive employee, such as if you worked at a call center or were a sous-chef or something, if your job requires you to allocate your time and attention to yourself being a schedule-maker as opposed to a schedule-taker, you need to allocate at least _some_ time in your day to reflective work. I’m not saying you need to spend your entire day in a cave, away from everyone else, concentrating. Some jobs do—I work with a lot of computer programmers, and their job is almost 100% reflective work, because the more interruptions a software team faces, the more bugs in the software.

But all knowledge workers need at least _some_ time—30 minutes, 40 minutes, an hour—in their day. _Some_ sacred part of your day needs to be planned ahead and reserved for that reflective work—_that’s_ what I’m advocating for.

**Shortform: So the day doesn’t always go as planned, but the timeboxed schedule _does_ allow for interruptions—you can schedule time for them.**

**Nir Eyal:** Here’s the beautiful thing about a timeboxed schedule. You might think, “I need to be on call because my boss demands it.” What I propose is the idea of _schedule syncing_: You can go to your boss with your timeboxed schedule and show them that you think you _need_ to be on call all day. Your schedule looks like 30 minutes of reflective work, seven and a half hours of reactive work.

Your boss is going to say, “What do you need to be on call all day for?” and you’ll respond, “Well boss, don’t you _need_ me to be available all day?” You know what the boss is going to say? “No, I want you to do your work! You don’t need to check your email every five minutes.”

People _think_ their bosses want them to be available all the time. No, your boss wants you to finish your work. So sit down with your boss—because timeboxing isn’t enough, it’s also about schedule syncing—and say, “This is how I spend my time. Is this correct? Is this how you _want_ me to spend time?” It’s not about output, but input of time and attention.

**Shortform: And how do you suggest that someone trying to create their schedule _outside_ an office setting—such as a stay-at-home mom, someone who’s going to have interruptions all day and doesn’t have anyone to schedule sync with—goes through this process of building a schedule that allows both what she wants to do and the distractions that naturally come up?**

**Nir Eyal:** So this is where it comes to living life according to your values. If one of your values as a parent is to take care of your kids, take care of your kids. Part of the problem is that we expect ourselves, and other people, to do everything. When we try to do everything, what ends up happening is that we do _nothing_ well.

As a parent, you need to ask yourself, “What are my values? How should I spend my time?” And I’m not going to say that every parent, particularly women, needs to be a homemaker. A woman or man can have a child and say, “I don’t want to spend all day with my child.” That’s fine—if your values are spending time at work on your professional ambitions, no problem. But make those expectations clear because the problem happens when we say, “I want to work and exercise and watch TV and check Facebook and watch my kids, all at the same time.” It’s impossible, even though there’s plenty of time in the day for the average American. For all the whining about there not being enough time in the day, the average American spends _six hours a day_ watching television. Don’t tell me there’s not enough time! There’s tons of time in our day for our kids _and_ our work, as long as we don’t try to do everything all at the same time.

> "Part of the problem is that we expect ourselves, and other people, to do everything. When we try to do everything, what ends up happening is that we do nothing well."

**Shortform: Since writing _Indistractable_, have you adopted any new anti-distraction behaviors, read interesting research, or found useful tools that have been helping you?**

**Nir Eyal:** The book is very autobiographical—I utilize everything. Anything that I talk about in the book, it came through this trial and error process of not only making sure that the techniques are backed by good research, but also that they worked for me in my own life. So yeah, I actually use all that stuff on a daily basis.

Is there anything _different_ that’s come out since the book? There’s been some really interesting studies—and I didn’t know these studies were being done—about how important internal triggers are. I didn’t have this research available when I wrote the book, but there was a study that came out a little while ago that showed that _90% of the time_ you check your phone, you don’t check because of an external trigger as most people think. Actually, 90% of the time we check our phones because of an internal trigger, an emotional state. That was something I had hypothesized around but didn’t actually have the data to show that it had such an impact. I wouldn’t have even guessed it would’ve been _that_ high.

So that was pretty interesting. And there’s actually been many tools that have come out [since the book’s publication], as well. I keep a running list of different tools that help people become indistractable. There was actually a student that read my book and built a [Chrome extension called “Indistractable''](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/indistractable-minimalist/kfgejlnmhacpkjolplkdpjfklphfighf?hl=en-GB) to help people stay focused. There’s been all sorts of new technology that have come out since I wrote the book to help people manage distraction, so that’s pretty cool.

**Shortform: That is cool. What does the Chrome extension do?**

**Nir Eyal:** I think it’s a free app to block certain websites during certain times of the day. So you can say, “Don’t give me access to email, Facebook, Reddit, or whatever when I'm trying to do work.”

**Shortform: That’s a great idea—I know there are lots of apps to block certain apps or websites, but you have to set it yourself when you start working. But, but when you go to block the website, it’s easy to say, “Well, I can just look at it quickly before I block it.” It’s a great idea to have it blocked automatically at certain times [to remove that temptation].**

**Nir Eyal:** It’s just the tip of the iceberg! There are so many interesting technologies, and I’m a huge believer in using technology to _improve_ technology. That’s what technology always does—the downsides of one generation of technology are an _opportunity_ for the next generation [to improve].

### Part 3: Dealing With Current Events

**Shortform: In the book, you talk about how it’s very easy to get distracted by news articles. You suggest “temptation bundling,” which is when you listen to articles in text-to-speech format while you’re doing something else, like exercising.**

**However, it seems that these days, there are a hundred important news stories breaking per hour, and our society really places a lot of value on being up-to-date on information, knowing what’s going on with different social issues, et cetera. There’s just too much information to consume, even with temptation bundling. How do you propose striking a balance here? How can we stay informed about numerous important issues without becoming totally overwhelmed and driving ourselves deeper into the distraction cycle?**

**Nir Eyal:** So, where this is coming from is your _values_. One of your values is to be an informed citizen (at least, that’s what I’m guessing is one of your values). _Why_ is that one of your values? Because you want to make sure you play a responsible role in society to improve the world. I think that’s a great value to have. But you need to realize that there will always be more information in the world, and more suffering in the world, than you will _ever_ have the ability to deal with.

There’s no way, even if you have limitless time, to cover everything that is made every second of the day, the suffering that is out there that you aren’t aware of, let alone your ability to _act_ on that suffering is impossible. So the first step is to admit defeat with the ridiculous ideal of “staying up to date.” You’ll never be able to stay up to date. Once we admit that fact, we then need to ask ourselves, “How much time is _enough_?”

This is where we go back to our timeboxed calendar. We ask ourselves, “How much time does the person _I want to become_ spend on staying up to date?” It can’t be 24 hours of the day, because we have other priorities: We have to take care of ourselves, we have to take care of our relationships, we have jobs. We have all this stuff we need to do other than consuming news all day. So how much time should we spend?

Let alone, as you mentioned earlier, which I think is a really astute point, is that the media companies are not in the business of keeping you informed. That’s not their job. Their job is to keep you on their website as long as you will keep clicking on ads. And I don’t care if it’s The New York Times or Fox News or CNN or BBC—they all have the same business model. They sell ads. You cannot rely upon them to be the editor of your time and attention, because that’s not their incentive.

You have to decide how much time is good for _you_ based on _your_ values. Half an hour a day, an hour a day, two, three hours a day—make that time in your schedule and timebox it like everything else while admitting to yourself, “I’m not ever going to be able to digest all of it. There’s just no way.” Over time, if you have way more news than you have time to consume, you can either make more time in your day if being more well-informed is aligned with your values, or—as you’re probably going to do, and it’s the healthier approach—say, “It’s too much. I’m subscribed to too many newsletters and spending too much time watching news. I need to cut down to only the high-value stuff.”

> "The media companies are not in the business of keeping you informed. That's not their job. Their job is to keep you on their website as long as you will keep clicking on ads. And I don't care if it's The New York Times or Fox News or CNN or BBC—they all have the same business model. They sell ads. You cannot rely upon them to be the editor of your time and attention, because that's not their incentive...You have to decide how much time is good for you based on your values."

**Shortform: This fits into a theme you’ve come back to a few times, which is _honesty_. That is, being honest enough with yourself to admit that you don’t have the ability to do everything. It’s an interesting point that I don’t think I would have connected to this problem of over-information—it can be tackled with honesty and being frank enough with ourselves to admit that it’s just not possible to care about everything we’d like to.**

**Nir Eyal:** I would say not only is it impossible, it’s actually _harmful_. One of your values is to stay informed, and another one of your values is likely to _act_—being informed has to come at the cost of something else. If you’re constantly worrying about other people’s problems instead of actually thinking about what you can _do_ with your time, that’s the cost. _The cost of reading too much is that you act too little._

**Shortform: And that makes the link with values clearer as well. If you find you’re spending too much time reading, you’re forced to narrow your values a bit and ask, “Okay, how much of this is news I truly _want to_ and _can_ act on?” If you’re trying to care about everything all the time, you’re spreading yourself too thin and can’t meaningfully work with the information. It just becomes static.**

**Nir Eyal:** Exactly. And that’s why I recommend people pick something they can _do_ something about. Where is your highest point of agency? You’re not going to be able to fix the environment as well as run town council meetings as well as national elections and so on.

_Pick the thing where you can effect the most change._ I think a good metric for that is _impact_ and _ease_. Ask yourself: Where can I have the biggest impact with the least amount of work? And just do that. Whatever it is, pick your issue. You just cannot do it all.

I think national politics is a great example of that—you know, we all have very little sway in the things people care the most about. How much time do we spend talking about stupid Donald Trump as opposed to something we _can_ do something about, like the local school board? We could actually effect change there, but we worry about stuff we can’t do anything about because it absolves us of responsibility: “Oh, I’m spending all my time reading the news so I’m up to date about the protest and the this and the that.” But what about something you could _actually do something about_? That’s a missed opportunity.

> "The cost of reading too much is that you act too little...Pick the thing where you can effect the most change. I think a good metric for that is impact and ease. Ask yourself: Where can I have the biggest impact with the least amount of work? And just do that. Whatever it is, pick your issue. You just cannot do it all."

**Shortform: I agree that there’s a missing opportunity in thinking only about the incoming information, rather than about narrowing our values to something we can do something about. I wish I’d had this advice before the election! I spent all of election week watching the results, just to be “up to date.” It wasn’t going to make a difference at that point.**

**Nir Eyal:** As long as you're honest about why you’re doing it. Look, I also watched way too much election coverage, but I knew I was doing it for entertainment. It was a soap opera. But I didn’t fool myself into thinking, “I’m an informed citizen. I need to do this.” No, I didn’t—it was a soap opera. That’s all it was! I voted, I gave some money, and that’s all I could do. The point where I have the most leverage in the world to effect positive change is not national politics.

**Shortform: It _was_ a soap opera. I was totally sucked in, watching the map and the constant updates.**

**Nir Eyal:** Well that’s what the media companies want! They make money that way. I mean, they hate that Trump is out of office now because it’s so much less interesting to watch...which is wonderful for our democracy but bad for their bottom line.

**Shortform: My next question brings us further into current events: Children’s school days look very different in the context of the pandemic, and I wanted to get your thoughts here. You mention that many schools are _way_ over-structured for children, and this removes the ability to develop feelings of autonomy and competence that children should be developing. But at the same time, school has traditionally been a place for children to develop critical interpersonal relationship skills and serves as a built-in respite from technology—and there’s recess, a sort of built-in free play.**

**This past year has been tumultuous for many school-age children and many have had to move their entire lives online—for example, school via Zoom and playtime via video games or video chat. It seems like it’s become impossible to maintain a balance between online interaction and face-to-face interactions that are critical for development. How do you think that this lack of balance between online life and real life may be affecting children?**

**Nir Eyal:** I'm not anti-school. I’m anti-bad _school._ School is a technology. People forget that school is a relatively new phenomenon. Public education is 150 years old—pretty darn new. For thousands and thousands of years, children did not go to formalized school and sit at desks and listen to teachers drone on and on. That’s a new invention. It’s not necessarily a _bad_ invention, but what I’m against is this ridiculous “teaching toward the test” and determining teacher pay based on how well their kids perform on some standardized test. I think that has some negative repercussions.

And you mentioned recess—I’m all for recess, but look how much time kids have for recess or physical education. It’s at record lows. It’s ridiculous. I would love for school to have more of what they used to have, which is more time for free play and more time for physical activity. It doesn’t exist like it used to. So, I’m not anti-school—I’m anti-_jail_. I’m against a school that looks like a prison, where all we do is shove facts in kids’ brains and expect them to regurgitate them on a page. That’s humiliating and boring and pointless. So, I'm all for good school and I think we can get to a place where we have quality education that isn’t so dependent on these types of tactics that are frankly, pretty inhumane and definitely breed people who don't lust for education. That’s the real tragedy, that school breeds all the joy of learning out of you.

And to come to the second part of your question—what do we do now that kids are home? First of all, it’s not all bad. We know that rates of childhood depression have gone _down_ during the quarantine, surprisingly enough. It’s fascinating—kids aren’t using technology less. If anything they’re using technology _more._ What’s changed is that they’re getting more sleep. Studies have found that kids are getting more sleep during this period at home because one of the terrible aspects of modern education in the United States is that we force our kids to get up at ungodly hours to catch a bus to drive an hour to get to school. Mental health requires proper rest—when kids don’t have enough time for sleep, a lot of bad things happen. So, it’s actually not the technology that’s causing mental health issues, it’s the lack of sleep.

So I think there are some beneficial aspects of kids learning from home, principally that they don’t have to spend so much time commuting and getting up crazy early. They spend more time with their families, which is probably also affecting their mental health in a positive way. When I was in school, there were all kinds of bad mental health stuff that came from being around bullies—it’s not like 8th grade is a bastion of harmony. It can be pretty awful for a lot of kids...it certainly was for me. It turns out that when kids spend more time with their parents, they have better mental health. There are a lot of upsides to kids _not_ being in formal school, but that doesn’t mean we can’t make school better. It’s just another technology.

> "I'm not anti-school. I'm anti-bad school. School is a technology….There are a lot of upsides to kids not being in formal school, but that doesn't mean we can't make school better. It's just another technology."

**Shortform: So, many kids are doing better by spending a lot of time with their families. On the other hand, do you think that not spending very much face-to-face time with their peers is affecting them? Is there a crucial aspect of development missing for them?**

**Nir Eyal:** What we call “free play” is very, very important. The problem is, what's happened today is that kids whose parents have any kind of money send their kids to hours and hours of after-school programs, whether it’s ballet or test prep or football or basketball—all this stuff to get them college scholarships and prepare them for this far-off, competitive future. This means they have no time to do what kids should be doing, which is _play_. Just being with peers. And I think that’s a huge problem.

**Shortform: During quarantine, kids _couldn’t_ go see their peers and experience free play—they were stuck at home. In these kinds of cases, can parents do anything to replicate the experience for them?**

**Nir Eyal:** I would say, “Where’s the alternative?” Right now, the alternative to being stuck at home playing by yourself online is playing with other people online. My daughter has regular playdates with other kids, some of them all over the world, and I think it’s wonderful. She draws with them, she plays games, she learns with them—there are all sorts of things kids can do. Thank _goodness_ we have this technology. If you want to propose a scenario where life would really be miserable for kids, it would be this quarantine without this technology. I would say for the time being, as long as it’s age-appropriate content, being online in the right way can be wonderful for them...Would I want my kid doing nothing else? No. But a few hours a day playing with a friend online? I think it's fantastic.

**Shortform: This past year has driven adults online for everything, too. We’ve now spent a year realizing that we can do virtually anything from home, such as work, hobbies, starting businesses, and so on. Do you think it’s been a good thing for us to realize how much of our lives we can live online? Or do you think having everything in the same place is going to drive people further into distraction?**

**Nir Eyal:** I’m pretty optimistic. I think that we’re pretty good at figuring out, in the course of time, what things hurt us and what things serve us. This is what human beings have always done: They adapt and they adopt. They adapt their behaviors and they adopt new technologies to fix the last generation of technology. So I’m pretty optimistic that we’re going to be okay.

> "This is what human beings have always done: They adapt and they adopt. They adapt their behaviors and they adopt new technologies to fix the last generation of technology. So I'm pretty optimistic that we're going to be okay."

**Shortform: I think it blurs a lot of boundaries between our lives where boundaries were really clear before: work at work and home things at home. Now, we’re in this place where we have all these external triggers that didn’t exist before, like your washing machine beeping at you during work. And there are a lot of internal triggers [and discomfort] that come with blurred boundaries as well. But from what I’m hearing you say is that while it feels a little tumultuous right now, people will figure it out.**

**Nir Eyal:** I would say that the triggers have changed. I don’t know if they’re better or worse—they’re different. It used to be Bob from accounting stopping by your desk or Jenny coming by to talk about some office gossip. So, working from home doesn’t necessarily mean all the triggers are bad. Some triggers went away—so in that respect, it’s great! There are a lot of things that are actually wonderful about working from home. Hopefully what we’ll do in the course of time is figure out how to keep the good stuff in and the bad stuff out.

**Shortform: At the beginning of this year’s pandemic, a lot of people went into it thinking, “My office could never manage this. I just don’t know how we’re going to do everything from home.” And now, many are liking it and many organizations are thinking about shutting down their offices in favor of a remote setting. So, do you think this will become the norm, now that we’ve started to figure out how to work from home? Or, do you think a lot of people are going to be chomping at the bit to get back into the office instead?**

**Nir Eyal:** Technology doesn't tend to die—it tends to find a niche. It’s kind of like Darwin’s finches: Species don’t go extinct completely, they tend to evolve into specific niches. I think that's what we’re going to find with working from home and the technologies that enable working from home. For some jobs and some niches, working from home is going to be great. For others, it’s not going to be great, and we’re going to go back to the way things used to be.

But a lot of people who otherwise wouldn’t have tried working from home are now trying it, which I think is a net positive. There are lots and lots of benefits to this, like the freedom that it provides for caregivers who now save all this time and are accessible in case of an emergency for their kids, parents, or whomever they might be taking care of.

There are so many benefits, but it really depends on the job. I mean, an airline mechanic can’t do their job from home, but a lot of other types of jobs can. Again, I think this is going to be a net positive when all is said and done. Nobody would have wished it, but now that’s happened, there are definitely silver linings.
