## Chapter 5: The Future Behind Me

I’d spent so much of my training learning to account for patients’ identities in my surgical decisions. Yet, in that familiar hospital room, now as a patient, with Lucy next to me, I could feel my identity, that of physician, slipping away. She and I both knew what my scans showed. Cancer lived inside me, had found a number of cozy corners to nestle into. The life I’d been working toward, the role I was going to play in the world, was disappearing.

I’d counseled a number of patients, guided them through the dark so they could see their new futures. But in that instance, I was no longer the guide. I was aimless, lost and unable to find a new path or even see what that new path should look like. My lung cancer diagnosis didn’t sharpen my view on life. It blinded me to life.

Death, which I had turned from a foe into a sometimes necessary associate, no longer waited at my side with deference. Death now sat across from me, and I didn’t know how to address it anymore. I didn’t know how to find the words with which to negotiate. It was as if I was being introduced to death for the first time, and the code of conduct was still unknown.

Lucy and I met with the doctor who would see me through my illness, Dr. Emma Hayward. She discussed the diagnosis with us, but she wouldn’t discuss a prognosis. She focused on how we should approach treatment so I could return to work. I thought she was out of her mind. Surely, returning to work was not an option. I knew it was an option I couldn’t even consider without knowing where I stood within the threshold I’d met so many patients at.

My network of support went to work, researching oncologists specializing in lung cancer to ensure I had the best care possible. The results of those searches all came back to the same place. Emma was the best and was respected as such within the medical community. She wasn’t just respected for her skills as a physician, however. She was also considered to be the best gatekeeper, the best judge of not just treatment, but of identity, as well. I couldn’t help but see the series of events that had landed me in this hospital and in the care of the best person in the world at the exact time I needed her as more than coincidence.

I was beginning to deteriorate, my body weakening. The identity I’d had, that of pursuer of meaning and overseer of life and death, was being stripped away. The cancer was progressing, and I knew I was inching closer to death each day. That reality took over the responsibility I’d carried in my work. It felt like I’d been driving in search of a rest stop for miles only to lose my bladder the moment one came into sight. The need for me to be strong for my patients was gone. My body no longer needed to be resilient. It was letting go---giving up the fight.

### Determining the Way Forward

Emma informed me of two possible avenues for treatment. There was the standard chemotherapy, attacking the cancer from the outside in. But there were other therapies, new discoveries that attacked the cancer from the inside out. I hadn’t realized how many advancements had been made in the treatment of certain types of cancer, and there was evidence that some of these newer therapies led to unthinkable survival rates for some.

This was the kind of discussion I’d had with so many patients. Explaining the approaches, outcomes, and option considerations. Emma was the kind of doctor I wanted---a doctor like me. For Emma, the considerations surrounded my ability to go back to work. This consideration was less of a priority for me, and I told her so. I could forge a different path if I had to. I wanted the treatment that would work the best, even if it meant losing my ability to operate.

My identity as a neurosurgeon had faded with my diagnosis, but here she was, telling me I could possibly be me again. I started to believe perhaps I could be, and that belief was pacifying.

With this possible regathering of my identity came a remembering of my ideals. I’d accepted that death was a part of life. I’d known it was something we all would experience. That truth was no more true simply because I had cancer. I was always going to die, but that hadn’t stopped me from living. Just because the fact of death appeared before I thought it would didn’t mean I should stop now, either.

### Confronting the Odds

Certain types of lung cancer have a mutation called EGFR, which becomes the target for treatment. This form of lung cancer adds approximately a year to the life-expectancy or the possibility of recovery and survival. A lack of this mutation dramatically reduces the chance of survival to less than two years.

Where once I had used statistics to inform the guidance I provided my patients, I no longer had the same grasp on their meaning. Knowing the numbers didn’t clarify anything about my experience. They weren’t objective tools anymore. They were subjective barriers.

Lucy and I visited a sperm bank, knowing that any form of treatment could hinder my ability to reproduce. We desired children, had assumed we’d have them when life stabilized after our training was over. We didn’t know whether that future still existed, but we didn’t want to lose our chance at it completely. I would freeze my sperm to keep that door open.

The door seemed to open a little more when we found out my cancer included the EGFR mutation. Thus, treatment would involve a pill, Tarceva, rather than chemo. I started treatment, and as the days and weeks passed, I grew stronger. The curtain that had dropped between me and my future started to lift a little at a time. I felt for the first time what I could only assume was hope.

### Becoming a New Version of Me

I was able to eat more and gained some of my weight back. My face broke out, which was representative of the body’s positive reaction to treatment. My ability to do the things I loved---being outdoorsy, active, playful, physically affectionate---were also changing. I was less attractive and less gregarious, but I was alive and feeling better.

I was a different person, a reality I had helped my patients and their families understand. I now understood, as they had come to, that I could only come close to resembling who I was again. But it was better than the alternative.

My meetings with Emma started to surround what my life’s narrative should be. I could follow the path that so many tended to follow---embrace the personal with everything I have left, such as family, friends, and experiences---or I could focus on becoming me again.

I’d always assumed I would work as a doctor and scientist for twenty or so years and transition to writer. Without knowing how much time I had left, I didn’t know which pursuit of the two was the priority or whether either were the right choice. If I had limited time, I would write. If I had a long-term prognosis, I’d continue on in medicine.

I told Emma all of this, but she still wouldn’t provide a number. She said she couldn’t, but I knew enough from my own experience that even when we won’t say how much time is left, we always had a sense of it inside. But there’d been times when I was wrong, when a patient I thought shouldn’t be kept alive recovered and lived a full life. I realized the determination of how I spent the rest of my time shouldn’t be motivated by subjective barriers.

I couldn’t fall back on a prognosis to tell me whether I should work or cherish what I had left. I couldn’t use it to decide whether or not to have a child. As a doctor, the statistics helped me formulate a clear picture for my patients, but for me, the picture was fuzzy. I would have to look death in the eye and determine what was important to me, what gave my life meaning, and find a way to try to live that life in whatever way I could.
