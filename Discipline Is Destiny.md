## 1-Page Summary

In _[Discipline Is Destiny](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/646520/discipline-is-destiny-by-ryan-holiday/)_, Ryan Holiday examines the power of discipline through the lens of the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism. Holiday argues that your ability to practice discipline—one of the four cardinal virtues of Stoicism—determines how successful you are (aka your destiny). This is because it dictates whether you work consistently and avoid the temptations that prevent you from attaining or maintaining success.

Holiday is one of the most well-known modern-day philosophers. He has written and co-written several best-selling books on Stoicism, including _[The Obstacle Is the Way](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-obstacle-is-the-way/1-page-summary)_ and _[Ego Is the Enemy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy)._ Published in 2022, _Discipline Is Destiny_ is the second book in his four-part series highlighting each of the cardinal virtues of Stoicism. (_[Courage Is Calling](https://shortform.com/app/book/courage-is-calling/)_ was the first.)

In this guide, we’ll explain what discipline is and why it matters. Then, we’ll describe how to practice discipline throughout various stages of your life—for instance, by regularly depriving yourself of pleasure. Along the way, we’ll compare Holiday’s ideas with those of other self-help experts.

### What Is Discipline?

Holiday asserts that discipline is the ability to restrain your baser urges in pursuit of what’s best for you. When you’re disciplined, you act with moderation, and you prize your ability to have total control over yourself. Like all humans, you face temptations, but you can resist these temptations when you need to—and if you _do_ choose to indulge in them, you do so with restraint.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/)_, Daniel Walter agrees that [discipline is the ability to fight temptations and instant gratification](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/1-page-summary#what-is-self-discipline-and-why-do-we-struggle-with-it) and ultimately act in your best interests. However, his definition of discipline doesn’t include the ability to indulge in temptations with restraint; it also doesn’t include a sense of self-satisfaction that stems from having self-control. Additionally, Walter suggests that we struggle with discipline due to four biological tendencies: resisting change that makes us uncomfortable, overestimating our abilities, procrastinating, and setting unrealistic expectations.)

Holiday asserts that discipline matters for four reasons. First, **discipline prevents you from taking the four cardinal virtues of Stoicism (courage, wisdom, justice, and temperance or discipline) to extremes** and turning them into flaws. For example, extreme courage might also be characterized as recklessness. Since discipline is predicated on practicing moderation, it prevents you from taking the cardinal virtues too far and thus _not_ living a good life.

(Shortform note: It’s clear how too much courage can harm you, but how can you take being just or wise too far? Holiday doesn’t specify, but other experts explain that the [Stoic virtue of justice involves honesty](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/), so you might be unvirtuous if you’re unnecessarily honest with someone and hurt their feelings for no reason. However, it’s not clear how being too wise can become a flaw.)

Second, **discipline leads to a good life**. Holiday explains that when you’re disciplined, you make better choices with your time: You regularly work to fulfill your purpose (which we’ll discuss in detail later) rather than wasting time with less important endeavors, such as watching Netflix every evening. The more time you spend working on your purpose, the more likely you are to fulfill it—and thus reap the benefits of doing so.

(Shortform note: Unless you develop discipline, you may never achieve your best life. In _The [Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/)_, Walter argues that _not_ making good choices with your time (by wasting it on unimportant endeavors) is not only undisciplined, but it can also [reduce your levels of self-discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/1-page-summary#tendency-3-procrastination) and make you even _less_ likely to spend time on and fulfill your purpose than you already were. He argues that self-discipline is a skill that takes practice to develop. So the more you procrastinate (a form of instant gratification that’s the opposite of self-discipline), the more habitual the procrastination becomes, and the weaker your ability to make productive choices becomes.)

Third, Holiday asserts that **discipline lets you keep your good life** because it stops you from allowing your emotions or baser urges to take control. When you’re disciplined, you take a moment to actively _choose_ how to react to any situation that you face. As a result, even if you feel powerful emotions, they don’t dictate your actions and cause harmful consequences. For example, despite your fury at your boss, you listen quietly to her scolding and choose to look for another job on your own terms rather than exploding at her and getting fired.

(Shortform note: Not everybody agrees that you’re _able_ to choose how to react in any situation. In _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow)_, psychologist Daniel Kahneman argues that automatic (fast) impressions arise from our senses and feelings (he calls this the mind’s “System 1”). Like Holiday, he acknowledges that these impressions can lead us to make poor choices that cause harmful consequences. But he believes it’s not feasible to _always_ check them through our disciplined rational mind (“System 2”) because it’s too slow. He suggests a compromise: Be aware of situations where System 1 thinking might lead to errors, and avoid those errors when the stakes are high by using System 2.)

Lastly, Holiday argues that **discipline makes you self-aware**. You’re able to recognize when you risk overindulging in something potentially harmful and thus stop yourself from doing so. This is true both of physical pursuits, like food or alcohol, and of certain character traits. For example, you may be ambitious, but you don’t take it to the extreme of constantly pursuing power and ignoring other things that matter, like your relationships.

(Shortform note: In _[10% Happier](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier/)_, Dan Harris agrees that being self-aware can make you more thoughtful and intentional in your approach to everyday life. However, he calls this self-awareness “mindfulness” and argues that it comes from regularly practicing meditation—not discipline. [Meditation teaches you to notice and accept your feelings](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier/part-3#how-to-respond-not-react)—like your desire for more food or alcohol or power—and then _choose_ how to respond to them. Harris learned from his mentor that if you try to ignore these feelings, [you just give them more power and influence over your actions](https://shortform.com/app/book/10-happier/part-2#mark-epstein).)

### How to Practice Discipline

Now that you know what discipline is and why it matters, we’ll discuss how to practice it. In this section, we’ll first discuss why identifying your purpose is essential to practicing discipline. Then, we’ll discuss how discipline helps set the stage for tackling your purpose and helps you _actually_ fulfill it. Finally, we’ll discuss how practicing discipline can help you effectively face the hardships you encounter—and maintain any success you achieve.

#### Identify Your Purpose

Holiday argues that to practice discipline effectively, you must first **identify your purpose.** Discipline requires that you work consistently toward a purpose and avoid temptations that distract you from that purpose. This is impossible if you don’t know what your purpose is. Holiday describes purpose as work that is _inherently_ enjoyable and not something you do in pursuit of external rewards. Truly loving your work is what will allow you to keep doing it despite the many challenges you may face—because while doing the work is hard, _not_ doing this work is unimaginable.

(Shortform note: Holiday’s definition of purpose has similarities to the Japanese concept of _ikigai_. In their book _[Ikigai](https://shortform.com/app/book/ikigai)_, authors Héctor García and Francesc Miralles explain that [ikigai is a person’s reason for existing or life purpose](https://shortform.com/app/book/ikigai#ikigai-your-reason-for-being). Your ikigai keeps you going in life, and you [pursue it throughout your whole life](https://shortform.com/app/book/ikigai#becoming-resilient)—not just when you’re getting paid for it—despite any setbacks you may face. However, unlike Holiday’s idea of purpose, you can have more than one ikigai. To find yours, ask yourself [what activities you enjoy so much that they make you forget about everything else](https://shortform.com/app/book/ikigai#finding-flow), including your worries and the passage of time. The answer to this question points toward your ikigai.)

#### Set the Stage

Once you identify your purpose, you must **set the stage** **to tackle it by preparing your body and environment**.

Holiday asserts that **taking care of your body** **ensures you’re healthy enough to pursue your purpose**. So eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and rest adequately. Eating well supports your health and lets you practice resisting temptation. Exercising regularly and pushing through physical challenges fortifies your ability to push through mental challenges. Getting enough rest provides your body with a chance to restore itself; working excessively to the point of ignoring your body’s needs is _not_ discipline and will likely backfire eventually. And sleeping well improves your ability to make hard decisions.

(Shortform note: In _[High Performance Habits](https://shortform.com/app/book/high-performance-habits/)_, Brendon Burchard agrees that maintaining your health is essential to pursuing your purpose. But while Holiday speaks of maintaining your health in _general_, Burchard argues that different habits support different areas of health—physical, mental, and emotional—and thus provide different benefits. Eating well, exercising regularly, and getting adequate rest [improve your physical health](https://shortform.com/app/book/high-performance-habits/habit-2#treat-your-body-better) and as such give you energy and mental clarity, and release brain chemicals that help with emotional management. [Good mental health](https://shortform.com/app/book/high-performance-habits/habit-2#the-benefits-of-health-and-the-risks-of-its-absence) enables you to pace yourself, which helps you stay on-task, while good _emotional_ health helps you relate to others and effectively handle stress.)

Holiday also recommends that you **straighten up** **your workspace and your appearance**—both of which _also_ set the stage for you to tackle your purpose. He argues that organizing your workspace frees up the mental energy you need to focus on your purpose and reduces the feeling of overwhelm from the massive amounts of information you encounter in your daily life—whether in emails or physical clutter. (Shortform note: Having an organized workspace may not improve your ability to work if your problem is not that you’re overwhelmed or tired but that you can’t be creative. Some studies suggest that [being in a messy environment improves creativity](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/is-a-messy-desk-a-sign-of-genius-heres-what-the-science-says).)

Similarly, straightening up your appearance puts you in a better mindset to work than being unkempt. Moreover, your appearance affects how positively _others_ perceive you and whether they want to work with you. While excessively focusing on fashion is undesirable, dressing well may allow you to connect with people who are essential to your work.

(Shortform note: Scientists agree that [your clothing affects your self-perception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103112000200), which changes how you work—a theory known as “enclothed cognition.” Notably, it’s not just what you wear, but how you _perceive_ what you wear that affects how you see yourself and how you work. In the 2012 study that introduced the term enclothed cognition, students were recruited to wear white lab coats. The students who were told that these were “medical doctor’s coats” were more able to sustain their attention than those who were told that they were “artistic painter’s coats.” This indicates that it was the value the students _assigned_ to the lab coats—not the lab coats themselves—that affected the students’ focus.)

#### Fulfill Your Purpose

Practicing discipline doesn’t just help you identify your purpose and prepare you to tackle it; it also helps you _fulfill_ that purpose by leading you to prioritize your purpose and behave appropriately when you’re working toward it.

Holiday explains that **when you’re disciplined, you prioritize your purpose** by regularly refusing potential opportunities that would divert your attention from what matters most. Set clear limits regarding what you’re willing to do and with whom you’re willing to speak, and avoid people who try to cross those limits. But don’t try to do it all yourself: Willingly accept or pay for any help that buys you time to reflect on _whether_ you’re doing what’s most important and to actually _do_ that work.

(Shortform note: Holiday’s approach to prioritizing your purpose aligns with the essentialist philosophy that Greg McKeown discusses in _[Essentialism](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/)_. Essentialists prioritize their purpose by [refusing opportunities that divert their attention from it](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/1-page-summary#learn-to-say-no). Essentialists set clear limits and avoid people who try to cross them; if someone repeatedly distracts them, [they plan how they’ll deflect her](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/part-3#set-boundaries), such as by making a list of the types of requests from her that they’ll refuse. Essentialists also [create space to escape and think](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/part-2#space-to-escape-and-think-get-away-from-the-routine), which helps them determine _what_ their purpose is and _explore_ how to fulfill it. And if they also follow the ideas in McKeown’s _[Effortless](https://shortform.com/app/book/effortless)_, they [embrace anything that makes their lives easier](https://shortform.com/app/book/effortless/1-page-summary#embrace-the-easy-approach) instead of overexerting themselves.)

Prioritizing your purpose also requires that you **design** **your schedule around your purpose.** Wake up early so that you can focus on the most important work. Doing what matters _first_ not only ensures that you’re not distracted by others’ demands (since they’ll still be asleep), it also ensures that you actually _do_ the thing you want to do instead of procrastinating—and potentially never getting around to doing it. Once you set this schedule, stick to it _every_ day—even on the days when it’s difficult to do so. Most people struggle to remain consistent. So if you can master consistency, you’ll steadily improve—and ultimately, grow more than those who don’t do it every day.

(Shortform note: Other authors elaborate on why consistency is important. In _[How to Become a Straight-A Student](https://shortform.com/app/book/how-to-become-a-straight-a-student/)_, Cal Newport explains that being consistent [turns doing this work into a habit](https://shortform.com/app/book/how-to-become-a-straight-a-student/1-page-summary#how-to-study-when-you-say-you-will). Once it becomes a habit, you’ll be less likely to procrastinate on it, and you’ll put in more hours, which means [you’ll get better at it](https://shortform.com/app/book/outliers/1-page-summary#opportunity-1-time-and-timing), as Malcolm Gladwell points out in _[Outliers](https://shortform.com/app/book/outliers/)_.)

> **Work When You Can Focus**
> 
> Waking up early, as Holiday suggests, may not help you focus on the most important work. Even if others are asleep when you awaken, distractions can come from other sources—for example, [if you check your phone in the morning, you may be waylaid](https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/teach-me/why-checking-your-phone-in-the-morning-could-be-sabotaging-your-day) by messages and emails you received overnight.
> 
> Moreover, you may struggle to focus in the early morning because, as _[When](https://shortform.com/app/book/when/)_ author Daniel Pink explains, [we all have different biological clocks](https://shortform.com/app/book/when/1-page-summary#your-chronotype) and so feel energetic at different times. Pink recommends doing your most important work when _you_ feel most energetic—whatever that time may be.

##### How to Work Well

Holiday adds that when you’re disciplined, you **figure out _how_ to do your work** most effectively. Start by mastering the fundamentals. Many people want to tackle the harder stuff first, but not mastering the fundamentals leaves you vulnerable to bigger problems down the line. For example, if you don’t understand factoring (an algebra concept), you’ll struggle to complete calculus problems (which require factoring). So practice these fundamentals until you can do them in your sleep.

(Shortform note: Holiday highlights the necessity of mastering the fundamentals of what you want to learn. But in _[Ultralearning](https://shortform.com/app/book/ultralearning)_, Scott Young proposes an alternate first step: Before starting to learn something, [figure out how you’re going to learn it](https://shortform.com/app/book/ultralearning#principle-1-learn-how-to-learn). Try breaking your topic down into information (what you simply need to memorize), ideas (what you need to understand at a deeper level than facts), and processes (what you need to practice to understand), and list everything relevant to learn in each category. Then, use this information to identify critical areas of focus for your learning.)

As your skills progress, refocus your attention on improving incrementally: You should always see _some_ improvement from the day before. As long as you prioritize improvement, you’ll retain the discipline to continue working—whether you’re performing well or poorly. Don’t get caught up in the idea that you have to do something perfectly, which can prevent you from working at all out of a fear that you’ll never achieve perfection. It’s most important that you _finish_ your projects.

(Shortform note: In _[The Bullet Journal Method](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-bullet-journal-method/)_, Ryder Carroll also recommends [focusing on continual improvement](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-bullet-journal-method/part-5-2#embracing-imperfection) and warns that chasing perfection can lead you to sabotage your potential because you can’t meet your impossibly high standards. To fight this mindset, [track your progress in a journal](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-bullet-journal-method/part-5-2#the-bullet-journal-solution); regularly note what you’ve accomplished and learned, decide how you can improve going forward, then record new goals and tasks based on your reflection.)

Figuring out how to do the work also involves knowing how to behave at each work session. Holiday emphasizes the importance of intense focus: When you’re working, pay attention exclusively to what you’re doing without allowing yourself to get distracted. Always put your best foot forward. As long as you do, you won’t become overly complacent if you do well (because you’ll keep putting your best forward despite external praise) nor devastated by unfavorable outcomes (because you know you gave it your all).

> **What Other Experts Say About Practicing Well**
> 
> Intense focus and always putting your best foot forward are both features of _deliberate practice_, which _[Peak](https://shortform.com/app/book/peak)_ author Anders Ericsson agrees are essential to building your skills. But [deliberate practice also includes other features](https://shortform.com/app/book/peak#deliberate-practice); for example, it involves objective ways to evaluate your performance, and it’s usually done under the tutelage of coaches.
> 
> That said, always putting your best foot forward may not be enough to keep you practicing. In _[Mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset)_, Carol Dweck explains that if you have a [fixed mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset#the-two-mindsets)—and thus believe that your talent is innate—you likely won’t push yourself when you succeed (because you feel superior) and [you’ll be discouraged by defeat](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset#the-mindsets-in-sports) (because you see it as a sign you’re not good enough). To keep working no matter what, you need a growth mindset—a belief that people can change and improve the abilities they’re born with.

Additionally, push yourself to take action and work hard, even when you don’t feel like it, but also learn to recognize when _waiting_ to act is the better option. For example, if you want a promotion at your job, work hard even when you’re not in the mood to do so. But if your company then goes through layoffs, wait to ask for a promotion until your company’s financial situation has improved.

(Shortform note: In _[168 Hours](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/168-hours/)_, Laura Vanderkam agrees that timing is everything when deciding how to act. However, rather than focusing on when you should _wait_ to act, she highlights the necessity of being as prepared as possible so that you’re able to take advantage of any opportunities that _do_ arise. To do so, Vanderkam recommends working for 30 focused hours each week on your purpose and regularly trying new things so you can encounter potential opportunities.)

#### Deal With Hard Times

As you go through life, you’ll inevitably encounter hardship. However, Holiday asserts that practicing discipline can help you deal with three types of hardship: pain, negativity, and failure.

##### Deal With Pain

To deal with pain, Holiday asserts that you must practice discipline by **learning to tolerate pain**. You must fight through your hardships (which are inevitable) if you want to have any chance of success. These hardships may seem impossible to overcome, especially if you’re experiencing significant physical pain or major mental health issues. However, Holiday insists that you must find a way to keep going despite this pain, whether that’s by finding an effective way to deal with it (such as by working through trauma) or by choosing to ignore it so you can work.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to tolerate and fight through pain, consider playing a sport. Although [the research is inconclusive](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1016/j.sjpain.2017.02.007/html), some studies suggest that [regularly experiencing the pain induced by training for and playing a sport may increase your tolerance](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01908/full) for physical and mental pain. Scholars have [different theories](https://healthland.time.com/2012/10/25/why-athletes-can-handle-more-pain/) as to why: Some suggest that it’s because exercise increases endorphins, while others suggest that it’s because athletes instinctively use strategies for coping with pain.)

##### Deal With Negativity

To deal with negativity, Holiday asserts that you must practice discipline by **resisting the urge to fight back.** If someone behaves poorly toward you, you may understandably want to fight against them or defend yourself. But doing so likely won’t improve the situation and may even worsen it. So it’s best to choose _not_ to engage with negativity—even when it seems impossible.

(Shortform note: Ancient Chinese philosophers agree with Holiday that you should avoid fighting. In the _[Tao Te Ching](https://shortform.com/app/book/tao-te-ching/)_, Lao Tzu argues that [peace should always be your top priority](https://shortform.com/app/book/tao-te-ching/section-3#violence-and-aggression) as aggression only pushes people away, and [violence only makes you seem unstable or desperate](https://shortform.com/app/book/tao-te-ching#leadership). But if you _do_ choose to fight back, _[The Art of War’s](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-war/)_ Sun Tzu recommends that you do so [only if you’re absolutely certain that you’re going to win](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-war/chapter-4#defense-vs-offense).)

##### Deal With Failure

Holiday asserts that dealing with failure in a disciplined manner requires that you **learn to handle it with grace**. In general, don’t treat failure as an excuse to stop; remain persistent and pursue your goals _despite_ the failure. Also, show yourself compassion: Instead of bombarding yourself with negative self-talk when you fail, talk to yourself as you would a friend. That said, don’t prioritize persistence above all else. Pushing forward is virtuous, but if you’re _unable_ to admit that you need to stop because you’re not doing well, you’ll keep going even when you shouldn’t—and ultimately encounter an even more agonizing defeat.

> **Other Ways to Handle Failure**
> 
> In _[Dare to Lead](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/)_, Brené Brown names the ability to recover and move on from defeat “[failure resilience](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead#skill-4-develop-failure-resilience),” and she asserts that it’s essential because you’re more likely to take risks and try new ideas if you’re confident that you can recover from any setback. A key component of developing failure resilience is [questioning the story that you’re telling yourself about why you failed](https://shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead#step-2-work-through-your-initial-story). This story is often driven by your own insecurities and so may lead you to beat yourself up unnecessarily or make illogical leaps; questioning that story can help you realize what’s _true_ and what’s an _assumption_.
> 
> Similarly, [asking questions can help you decide when it’s time to quit](https://www.fastcompany.com/40545078/ask-yourself-these-4-questions-before-you-quit-something). Specifically, experts recommend asking yourself why you originally undertook the project (to see if it’s veered from its original purpose), why you want to quit now, whether you’ve tried everything to make this pay off, and what you’ll gain from quitting.

#### Maintain Your Success

Self-discipline isn’t just important in hard times—it’s also essential to maintaining your success in good times. Holiday asserts that practicing discipline can help you with four things that come with success: ego, pleasure, power, and money.

##### Handle Your Ego

Holiday asserts that to practice discipline well, you must first **keep your ego in check**. Your success with self-discipline may make you a role model that other people want to follow, but don’t _expect_ that others will practice discipline just because _you_ are doing so. Instead, focus your energies on your own behavior and let others do what they will. Similarly, don’t let your ego convince you that you no longer need self-discipline. The more successful you become, the greater the temptations you’ll face—but if you want to _maintain_ that success, you need to continue practicing the discipline that made you successful.

Additionally, don’t let your ego tie you to habits that no longer serve you. Holiday warns that you may grow so attached to the habits that made you successful that you stick to them—even when they’re not having the same impact they had before. Prevent this by regularly examining your routines and modifying them if they’re no longer working. Otherwise, you won’t be able to keep up with the world as it changes.

> **Holiday’s Other Views on Ego**
> 
> In _[Ego Is the Enemy](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/)_, Holiday also warns that keeping your ego in check is essential to maintaining success. But rather than focusing on how sticking to certain _habits_ can destroy your success, he focuses on [how certain traits that brought you success can, if left unchecked, rob you of it.](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-2#dont-let-your-success-destroy-itself)
> 
> To avoid this trap, Holiday advises looking out for certain feelings your ego might enhance. First, your confidence may grow into hubris that convinces you that you’re _entitled_ to the things you desire (which, although Holiday doesn’t mention this, may also make you feel as though you deserve to indulge in certain temptations). Second, you might start expecting _everything_ to go your way, as if you _control_ the world—or the people around you. Holiday contends you can avoid this fate by remembering that you don’t have a claim on anything that’s not already yours and by recognizing that you’re not the center of the world.

##### Handle Pleasure

According to Holiday, another way to practice discipline when you’re successful is to **look for opportunities to make your life _less_ pleasant**, such as by immersing yourself in cold water. Regularly experiencing displeasure will make you unafraid of living without the trappings of success, which may be an essential skill if you ever lose your fortune.

(Shortform note: Regularly experiencing displeasure by immersing yourself in cold water may also improve your ability to handle stressors like potentially losing your fortune. This is because, as Wim Hof explains in _[The Wim Hof Method](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-wim-hof-method/)_, the cold causes a physiological response that’s identical to your response to emotional stressors—so by training yourself to handle the cold through repeated exposure, [you train yourself to handle other kinds of stress](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-wim-hof-method/1-page-summary#understanding-cold-exposure), too.)

For example, the Roman philosopher Seneca possessed great wealth, but he regularly went without—for instance, by sleeping on the ground—to remind himself that he could handle being poor and that losing his wealth was not as terrifying as it seemed. This habit came in handy when he fell out of favor with the emperor Nero: Seneca was able to willingly give Nero all his riches in exchange for his life because he was unafraid of losing the trappings of success.

(Shortform note: By highlighting Seneca’s habit of going without, Holiday presents Seneca as a model of Stoic philosophy and Nero as a clear villain. But the two had a complicated relationship: Seneca was famously Nero’s tutor and at times supported Nero’s questionable behavior, such as by [lying to the Roman Senate that Nero’s mother was planning a coup after Nero tried to kill her](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/stoic-2).)

##### Handle Power

Holiday suggests that another way to practice discipline is by **learning how to handle power**. Contrary to popular opinion, gaining power doesn’t give you extra perks; rather, power _is_ the perk. Therefore, you ought to do _more_ than the people below you—not less, as most are wont to do. For example, when former Defense Secretary (and then-Brigadier General) James Mattis encountered a soldier performing guard duty on Christmas Day, he sent the soldier home to enjoy the holiday and worked guard duty himself—instead of deciding that his holiday off was a perk of power.

(Shortform note: Holiday’s perspective on power aligns with that of Simon Sinek. In _[Leaders Eat Last,](https://shortform.com/app/book/leaders-eat-last/)_ Sinek argues that if you’re a leader, your primary responsibility is to [prioritize your subordinates’ needs above your own](https://shortform.com/app/book/leaders-eat-last#why-you-should-prioritize-your-subordinates-needs). By doing so, you prove that you see them as people—not as assets you can use. As a result, your subordinates feel as though you support them, which makes them feel safe and thus more willing to collaborate and take the risks necessary for success. Mattis made his soldiers feel that way both through his actions (like working guard duty on Christmas) and [through his words](https://www.businessinsider.com/general-mattis-stories-2016-12): One soldier praised Mattis for giving a relatable speech during wartime, saying, “Mattis spoke like an enlisted man. He spoke to the enlisted man.”)

Additionally, you must learn to give up power. The most self-disciplined people have control over themselves; as a result, they don’t desire control over others. Moreover, they understand that having too much power often leads to self-destruction—and so they’re willing to give it up. (Shortform note: In _[David and Goliath](https://shortform.com/app/book/david-and-goliath/)_, Malcolm Gladwell proposes that [having too much power leads to destruction](https://shortform.com/app/book/david-and-goliath/chapter-7#the-principle-of-legitimacy): When you have power, you forget that you only have as much power as your subjects are willing to _give_ you. If you take an action that your subjects deem unfair or unpredictable, or that makes them feel voiceless, they view your power as illegitimate and grow defiant—which weakens your power and may lead to your destruction.)

##### Handle Money

Finally, Holiday argues that practicing discipline when you’re successful requires you to **adjust your view of money**. Some people believe that if they make enough money, they’ll be able to do whatever they want. They won’t need self-discipline because they can spend freely and ignore others’ opinions. But while money can make your life easier, it can’t free you from _all_ life’s worries; you’ll still need self-discipline to handle them. So instead of needlessly striving for money that will let you do whatever you want, strive for an amount that allows you to live in accordance with your purpose.

(Shortform note: In _[The Psychology of Money](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-psychology-of-money/)_, Morgan Housel also warns against relentlessly chasing money, explaining that [if you always want more money, you might risk your existing wealth](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-psychology-of-money/part-2#lesson-6-be-happy-with-enough) for additional wealth you don’t even need. To stop striving for more, Housel recommends [accepting that somebody else will always have more money than you do](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-psychology-of-money/part-2#how-to-be-happy-with-enough). Otherwise, you’ll always compare yourself to others and never be satisfied.)
