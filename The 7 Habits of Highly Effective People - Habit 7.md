## Part 4 | Habit 7: Practice Self-Renewal

**Habit Description:**

- Self-renewal maintains your well-being so that you can continue doing the work of Habits 1-6.

### Why It Matters

**You must keep yourself mentally and physically healthy in order to avoid burnout and continue being productive.** Covey returns here to the concept of balancing output and capacity from Part 1. In this case, your good habits and positive behavior are the output, and your physical, mental, and emotional health is the capacity.

Covey says self-renewal not only enables you to continue practicing the other six habits—**it actually improves your efficiency and effectiveness, creating an upward spiral of growth and self-improvement.** Self-renewal nurtures your conscience, the small voice that pushes you toward what’s right and aligned with your principles. As you feed and strengthen your conscience, it helps you stay disciplined and focused on a principle-centered path that fosters growth through the seven habits.

> **Self-Care Buffers Against Stress**
> 
> While Covey focuses on how self-renewal enhances your positive habits, he overlooks the fact that one of the pivotal ways it does this is by [weakening the negative impacts of stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080382/). In other words, the better you manage your stress through self-care, the more you can engage in positive behaviors. This reframes the benefits of self-care: It doesn’t make you feel better by masking or distracting from your issues, but rather by helping you work through them.
> 
> A 2018 survey of hundreds of American medical students—a notoriously stressed-out population—asked them to self-report their levels of self-care, stress, and quality of life. The researchers found that students who engaged in more self-care had a higher quality of life, despite high levels of stress.

### How To

Covey prescribes self-renewal in four dimensions, and he explains how each one connects with the previous six habits:

1. **Physical: Eat well, exercise, and get enough sleep and relaxation.** This requires the initiative-taking honed in Habit 1 (for example, to go to the gym or cook dinner instead of grabbing fast food), and each time you make a healthy choice, you strengthen that discipline.
2. **Spiritual: This can take many forms, such as prayer, meditation, reading, writing, and spending time in nature.** This not only inspires and uplifts you, but it also reconnects you to your center and principles (Habit 2).
3. **Mental: Exercise your mind by reading, writing, and exposing yourself to new information.** You need a sharp mind for the organizing and scheduling practices in Habits 2 and 3, and to effectively communicate with others (Habit 5).
4. **Social/emotional: Covey argues that, since your emotional health is so closely tied with your social interactions, this form of self-renewal actually comes from practicing Habits 4-6.** In order to effectively practice these habits, you need a strong sense of personal security, which is built through living in alignment with your principles and helping others.

> **Focus on What’s Most Important**
> 
> Minimalists have developed similar categories, not for the express purpose of self-renewal, but rather as a way to focus on the most important things in order to eliminate excess and live a simpler life. However, decluttering your life in key areas could also contribute to self-renewal.
> 
> In _[Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life](https://asymmetrical.co/books/minimalism-live-a-meaningful-life/)_, authors and minimalists Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus describe five key values to focus on (some of which overlap Covey’s four dimensions):
> 
> - [Health](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-2)—Eat well and exercise.
>     
> - [Relationships](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-3)—Drop unproductive relationships and invest in meaningful ones.
>     
> - [Passions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-4)—Pursue a mission-driven passion instead of career and status.
>     
> - [Growth](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-5)—Make small, daily changes that contribute to substantial growth over time.
>     
> - [Contributing to others](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-6)—Serve society and help others grow.

### Going Deeper

Beyond benefiting yourself, Covey argues that self-renewal benefits the people around you—which further benefits you, creating a virtuous cycle:

1. Self-renewal helps you attain inner peace and stability.
2. When you’re centered, you react to those around you in a more empowering way, showing them a positive image of themselves that emphasizes their potential.
3. When people see that you see them in a positive light, they live up to that. In other words, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Shortform note: Since Covey believes that the seven habits embody the ideal way of living, he implies that your positive reflection empowers others to be their best selves, which is to live by the tenets of the seven habits.)
4. As people around you rise to your expectations of them, they become more cooperative and collaborative in your interactions.
5. Your improved interdependence with these people then elevates your mastery of the habits and renews this cycle.

> **_Awaken the Giant Within_: Help Yourself to Help Others, and Vice Versa**
> 
> Covey’s description suggests that your self-care _passively_ benefits those around you by making you a calmer, more pleasant person to interact with. By contrast, Tony Robbins urges you to take a more _active_ role by finding ways to give back to others, and he explains that this has a somewhat cyclical relationship with self-care: On one hand, he asserts that giving back to those around you (as well as society and the world, on a larger scale) is an [essential element to living a fulfilling life](https://shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within).
> 
> On the other hand, he emphasizes that you must [nurture your own needs in order to have the capacity to give](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/part-4-chapter-21) to others—analogously, flight attendants instruct passengers to secure their own oxygen masks before helping others put on theirs. Additionally, when you recognize that you don’t have to be a martyr to help others, you’ll be more inclined to take care of yourself _and_ those around you.
