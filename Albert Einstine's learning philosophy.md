Albert Einstein was a self-taught physicist who had a unique approach to learning. He was not a traditional student and did not enjoy attending classes. Instead, he preferred to learn by reading, thinking, and experimenting on his own.

Einstein's philosophy of learning was based on the idea that the best way to understand something is to question it. He believed that we should not accept things at face value, but should always try to find the underlying reasons for them. He also believed that we should not be afraid to make mistakes, as mistakes are often the best way to learn.

Here are some of the specific ways that Einstein learned things:

- He read voraciously. Einstein read everything he could get his hands on, from scientific journals to philosophy books. He believed that the more he read, the more he would learn.
- He thought deeply about the things he read. Einstein was not content to simply read about a concept; he wanted to understand it deeply. He would often spend hours thinking about a problem, trying to find the best way to solve it.
- He experimented. Einstein was a hands-on learner. He believed that the best way to understand something was to experience it for himself. He would often set up experiments in his home to test his theories.
- He was not afraid to make mistakes. Einstein knew that mistakes are often the best way to learn. He would often make mistakes, but he would learn from them and move on.

Einstein's philosophy of learning was unique and unconventional, but it was also very effective. He was able to make significant contributions to physics because he was willing to question the status quo and think for himself.

Here are some of the quotes from Einstein that reflect his philosophy of learning:

- "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."
- "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
- "The only source of knowledge is experience."
- "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
- "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know."

Einstein's philosophy of learning is still relevant today. It is a reminder that the best way to learn is to be curious, to think for yourself, and to be willing to make mistakes.
