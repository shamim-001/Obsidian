## Feedback 1: Start with Praise

The final part of the book deals with giving feedback to people. You don’t begin in an argument like Part 3 teaches, but you notice something that needs improving and need to communicate it.

This advice applies in relationships of all directions - your superiors, equals, and subordinates. Even your bosses appreciate praise for what they do and sympathy for the difficulties of their role!

### Principles

- **It’s always easier to listen to unpleasant things after hearing praise about our good points.** Without praise, it just sounds completely critical without any appreciation of the hard work done.
- This is even more effective when the person knows you are upset with the work and have come to complain - **sincere appreciation is a surprise** and makes the person receptive to your feedback. They feel they have your confidence, and they’re open to improving rather than defending their competency.

### Tactics

- Be sincere with your praise. You have to _actually_ appreciate the work to sound genuine.
- Give specific praise about specific items well done, rather than generalities.
- Avoid being formulaic with the praise. Don’t say something that doesn’t really apply, or can apply to nearly anyone else.

### Examples

- A subcontractor was delaying on parts. A manager from the construction company visited the president. First the manager pointed out that he had a distinctive name, the only one in Brooklyn. Then he commended him on the cleanliness of the factory. On a tour, he complimented the president on specific machines the president had designed. At the end of lunch, the president said he knew why the manager was here and said the parts would be shipped on time, even if they had to delay the other parts.
