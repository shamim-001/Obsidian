#useEffect 

In React's `useEffect` hook, the second argument is an array of dependencies. This array tells React when the effect should be executed. There are two main scenarios:

1. **Empty Dependency Array (`[]`):**
   When you provide an empty dependency array (`[]`), the effect will run only once, immediately after the component mounts. It's similar to the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method in class components. This is often used for actions that only need to be performed when the component first renders, and not on subsequent updates.

   In your code:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const storedSubjects = localStorage.getItem("subjects");
     if (storedSubjects) {
       setSubjects(JSON.parse(storedSubjects));
     }
   }, []);
   ```
   This effect is used to retrieve the stored subjects data from `localStorage` when the component mounts. Since the dependency array is empty, the effect runs only once, right after the initial render.

2. **Dependency Array with Variables (`[subjects]`):**
   When you provide a dependency array with variables (like `[subjects]`), the effect will run whenever any of the variables in the dependency array change. This is similar to the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method in class components.

   In your code:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     localStorage.setItem("subjects", JSON.stringify(subjects));
   }, [subjects]);
   ```
   This effect is used to store the updated subjects data in `localStorage` whenever the `subjects` array changes. Since `[subjects]` is provided in the dependency array, the effect will run each time the `subjects` array is updated.

By utilizing the dependency array, you're telling React when to execute these effects based on changes to specific variables. This helps in controlling the behavior of the effects and optimizing their execution. If you provide an empty dependency array, the effect runs only once after the initial render. If you provide variables in the dependency array, the effect will run whenever those variables change.
