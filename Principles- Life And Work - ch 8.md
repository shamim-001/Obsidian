## Chapter 8: Visualizing Complex Systems as Machines

In addition to total receptivity, extreme honesty and transparency, productive conflict, and letting the best ideas win, Dalio says that viewing complex systems as machines can help you make better decisions.

He explains that laws and forces in the universe interacted and evolved to create galaxies, planets, markets, and humans, and that all these complex machines continue to evolve and interact to create our reality. To him, **understanding the cause-and-effect relationships within each machine and _between_ machines can help you glean predictable patterns.** Seeing the same situations happen again and again over time can then help you determine corresponding repeatable courses of action.

(Shortform note: Dalio believes that everything that happens has already happened before, so it’s possible to predict and manage future events by looking to the past, using a set of principles to weather any kind of storm. In contrast, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that the world is random and unpredictable, and the important thing isn’t to withstand difficult situations, but to actually learn how to [become stronger under stress](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/antifragile). Read more in our [full guide to Antifragility](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/antifragile).)

We’ll explore how Dalio applies this view on the individual level, the market level, and the organizational level.

### The Machine of Your Life

Dalio says that first and foremost, you should think of yourself as a machine: You take in inputs (such as goals, resources, and current skills), and you produce an output (progress toward your goals). **Your aim is to design your machine to produce better outcomes—or in other words, design your life in service of achieving your goals.** Viewing yourself in this way enables you to see your weaknesses objectively.

Dalio reiterates that you should look at your weaknesses as problems to be fixed instead of ignored, because ignoring them can lead to bigger problems. Think of it in terms of a machine: If your car breaks down, you would have it fixed instead of letting it deteriorate.

(Shortform note: Dalio’s suggestion here may seem unusual, as it goes against a common piece of career advice: [Ignore your weakness](https://www.inc.com/yoram-solomon/2-reasons-to-ignore-your-weaknesses-that-will-make-you-great.html) and focus on your strengths. However, [overplaying your strengths also has two downsides](https://hbr.org/2009/02/stop-overdoing-your-strengths): First, your strengths can _turn_ _into_ weaknesses. For example, if being vocal is your strength, you might overdo it and become overbearing. Second, when you focus too much on a specific skill set, you can become a lopsided leader with limited capabilities. Reflect and ask others to help you determine if you’re overdoing your strengths, then recalibrate if necessary.)

#### Address Your Weaknesses, But Be Realistic About Your Limits

Dalio says you’ll never be able to be proficient at all the things necessary to reach your goals because _nobody_ can be proficient at everything. For example, even Albert Einstein, with all his strengths, was incompetent at other things like basketball, while basketball great Michael Jordan isn’t a quantum physics hall-of-famer.

Don’t be upset if you find you’re bad at something—be _happy_ you found out, since this will give you a better idea of what’s holding you back and improve your chances of meeting your goal. Once you find your weakness, Dalio says you have two options:

**1) Improve yourself.** Dalio recommends improving your skills by doing mental exercises like reflecting on your painful mistakes and deliberately practicing things that are uncomfortable for you. For example, you can practice being more talkative or following through on your plans.

(Shortform note: These mental exercises have the added benefit of making you acutely self-aware. This strong sense of self [enables you to accept other people’s opinions](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership/level-2) more openly and to communicate more effectively, writes John C. Maxwell in _[The 5 Levels of Leadership](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership)_.)

**2) Ask others to fill the gaps.** You can try to work on your weaknesses, but some skills are just inconsistent with your nature. For example, some visionaries are bad at execution and details, and they can only change the way they see things so much. In cases like these, it’s probably better to ask those with complementary strengths to step in so that you can focus on your own areas of strength.

(Shortform note: Maxwell writes that to properly fill in your strength gaps, you should [know exactly what skill you’re looking for and recruit specifically for it.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-levels-of-leadership) It’s no use hiring a stellar candidate who doesn’t have the skills you need. For example, if your baseball team is in need of a good pitcher, you’re not going to recruit a star batter, no matter how good he is.)

### The Machine of Economics

The second area that you should look at as a machine is economics. As a financial trader, Dalio learned to see the market as composed of a network of things that had cause-and-effect relationships with each other. For example, how much livestock there was and how much they ate influenced the demand for corn and soybean.

By visualizing the market in this way, Dalio was able to figure out repeatable trading rules. He broke them down into components, understood how each part worked, and proposed solutions based on the cause-and-effect relationships within the machine.

> **Can the Past Really Predict the Future?**
> 
> Dalio believes that every event has happened before, even if it wasn’t during his lifetime, and so it’s possible to determine cause-effect relationships and predict outcomes within the economic machine. However, former options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that **every system has “black swans”**—events that are by their very nature unpredictable and thus cannot be accounted for by any machine.
> 
> In _[The Black Swan](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan)_, Taleb writes that one reason “experts'' often get predictions wrong is that [they base their predictions on the past](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan), which in itself has many unknowable factors. For example, if you see a small pool of liquid on a table, you can ascribe it to a melted ice cube or a spilled drink, but the number of possible causes makes it impossible to know for sure. Read more about black swans and how to prepare for them in our [full guide](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-black-swan).

### The Machine of Your Organization

The third area that you should look at as a machine is your organization.

Dalio says that the two most important components of an organization are its people and its culture. Getting the right mix of people who are aligned with the organization’s culture leads to the best outcomes. If your outcomes aren’t consistent with your goals, then you need to determine what’s wrong with the machine: There may be a flaw in the design of the organization itself or a problem with the people working in it.

(Shortform note: In the same way that you need to scan your “individual” machine for weaknesses to be addressed, you also need to understand and address the weaknesses of your bigger machine—your team. Watch out for the [five dysfunctions of a team](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team) that typically prevent them from succeeding: an absence of trust, a fear of conflict, a lack of commitment, avoiding accountability, and inattention to results. You can read more about these team weaknesses in our [full guide to The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team).)

#### Organization Structure

Visualizing your organization as a machine means coming up with the most efficient structure and giving everyone a clear idea of their roles and responsibilities. Dalio gives these pointers for managing or improving your organizational machine:

**Imagine the ideal organization, and only then choose the right people for it.** Don’t take the people you have and then fit an organization to them. (Shortform note: By [assessing a candidate’s fit](https://hbr.org/2015/07/recruiting-for-cultural-fit) during the recruitment process, you can increase the likelihood that they’ll succeed at the role you put them in and stay longer with the organization.)

**Clarify goals for each department.** Don’t merge two distinct departments into one just because they have similar tasks. Instead, base departmental divisions or merges on _goals_ to prevent misaligned priorities. For example, Marketing and Client Services both have the _task_ of communicating with outside parties, but their _goals_ aren’t the same: Marketing aims to make sales while Client Services takes care of existing clients. (Shortform note: When it’s necessary for departments to collaborate, [it’s generally better for managers to communicate directly](https://hbr.org/2002/03/do-you-have-a-well-designed-organization) with the departments in question, rather than passing messages through top management. In cases when collaboration between departments can lead to conflict—due to differing goals, for example—come up with a detailed coordination system.)

**Minimize the number of layers** in the pyramid and reduce bureaucracy by making departments self-sufficient. (Shortform note: In _[Measure What Matters](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/measure-what-matters)_, venture capitalist John Doerr writes that traditional management systems tend to have a hierarchy, while the objectives and key results system (OKR) tends to have a top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal approach rather than the typical pyramid.)

**Add governance and checks and balances.** Governance is oversight that removes people and processes if they are failing. A company should have a board that determines if the people running the company are capable. This board should have reporting lines independent of the CEO’s reporting line to avoid conflict of interest. Dalio says the board can select CEOs but should not micromanage the firm, and board members must have the courage to hold people accountable. (Shortform note: Some companies have one person as both CEO and Chairman, but [experts say that this setup isn’t ideal](https://hbr.org/2020/03/why-the-ceo-shouldnt-also-be-the-board-chair) for a number of reasons: It prevents neutral governance and proper checks and balances, keeps an organization from the benefits of having two talented leaders with different skill sets, and can lead to more decisions that benefit the organization but harm customers and stakeholders.)

**Make leadership a group effort.** Dalio believes that having a single CEO has some disadvantages, like opening up an organization to more risk and overburdening one individual. Thus, Bridgewater has co-CEOs and co-CIOs to share the load. (Shortform note: While some believe that [two heads are not better than one](https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-ceos-are-out-of-style-why-is-netflix-resurrecting-the-management-model-11594987416) when it comes to running a company, others argue that [two leaders can cover more ground](https://hbr.org/2020/09/is-ceo-a-two-person-job).)

#### The Manager as Engineer

Dalio sees managers as organizational engineers in charge of building, maintaining, and improving the machine. They have the following responsibilities:

**They use metrics to study how well the machine is doing.** They compare the current outcomes with the ideal outcomes, and find ways to close the gap. (Shortform note: To [focus on relevant metrics](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-output-management/chapter-8), former Intel CEO Andrew Grove recommends choosing those that measure output rather than activity, and that are physical and countable.)

**They worry about what can go wrong with the machine.** They constantly survey the landscape to find suspicious signs of problems. They also study what goes wrong in the machine—either it’s a problem with the machine’s design or with the people. (Shortform note: To [be effective problem-solvers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2013/11/04/the-4-most-effective-ways-leaders-solve-problems/?sh=1993c66f4f97), managers should be able to emphasize transparent communication, foster collaboration, and execute well-planned strategies.)

**They can anticipate the results from different inputs of people.** They also expect that people will be imperfect, so they design a machine that produces good results even with mistakes. (Shortform note: Keep in mind that there’s a difference between making sure each individual is great and [making sure the team is great](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-to-build-a-great-team-with-imperfect-people.html). A manager’s role is to ensure that imperfect individuals collectively produce the best outcomes.)

**They can sit back and watch the machine do its work.** Having to micromanage is a sign of improper machine design or the wrong people in the roles. However, you should also take care not to be so distant from the details that you’re not managing at all. (Shortform note: Micromanagers typically have a difficult time with delegation. To [delegate effectively](https://hbr.org/2017/10/to-be-a-great-leader-you-have-to-learn-how-to-delegate-well), you should clarify why something is important to you and what you expect from your team, ask them how much guidance they need, and learn to say no.)

#### Designing the Best Team

Dalio says that, as the designer of your machine, you are tasked with designing the team to best meet your desired outcome. Likewise, you should view yourself and other people around you as part of the machine of your organization. You need to define what roles you need, then put the best people in those roles.

(Shortform note: Designing the best team possible will usually mean promoting your subordinates into higher-level positions in which they can put their skills to the best use. However, be aware that newly promoted members in your team may struggle with their new roles due to the [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle): the idea that people keep getting promoted due to their performance until they reach a level where they’re no longer competent. One way to [increase the chances of success of newly promoted team members](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roddwagner/2018/04/10/new-evidence-the-peter-principle-is-real-and-what-to-do-about-it/?sh=331b6f6c1809) is to make sure they get the training and mentoring they need.)

To design the best team to make sure your organizational machine runs smoothly, Dalio gives the following tips:

##### Build From the Top Down

**First, hire managers who can help build the machine.** Managers should also be good at what they’re managing, so they can intervene in case their reports aren’t doing well. They should have high standards so they can recognize problems.

(Shortform note: Aside from being good at what they’re managing and being good troubleshooters, [managers should also be able to listen to team members](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/smarter-faster-better/chapter-7) and encourage everyone to participate in discussions.

##### Build a Team of People Who Complement Each Other

Some people are visionaries who set big goals, some are designers who create the plan, some are taskmasters who make sure the plan gets implemented. Some can do multiple roles well, but no one can do them all well. Make each person’s responsibilities clear.

(Shortform note: Complementary strengths can make up for weaknesses, but make sure you avoid [confusion and clashes](https://hbr.org/2007/04/the-leadership-team-complementary-strengths-or-conflicting-agendas) (over priorities, for example) by fostering communication and trust.)

##### Have Straight Single Reporting Lines That Don’t Cross

Reporting to two people, especially when across different departments, causes confusion, except when reporting to co-heads of the same department. Dalio says you should forbid asking people from other departments to do tasks for your department unless first approved by their manager.

(Shortform note: Some organizations have [dotted-line reporting](https://hbr.org/2013/05/are-you-considering-a-job-with), meaning one individual reports directly to one boss while also performing tasks for another boss. [If your organization has this structure](https://hbr.org/2013/05/are-you-considering-a-job-with), make sure that dual bosses are aligned and collaborative to minimize confusion for team members.)

##### Limit Manager to Direct Report Ratios

**Dalio says that the ideal** manager to direct report ratio ranges from 1:5 to 1:10.

(Shortform note: Experts say that the [number of direct reports depends on different factors](https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/how-many-direct-reports-should-you-have.html) like how complex the work is, the skill level of employees, and the manager’s experience.)

##### Allow for Escalation

**Allow escalation—or passing tasks on to someone else—when people can’t handle their responsibilities.** Dalio says you shouldn’t treat this as a failure, but rather a responsibility.

(Shortform note: [If a team member is overburdened](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/how-to-manage-a-staff-that%e2%80%99s-overworked.html), you can go through their daily task list with them, then determine which tasks should be prioritized.)

##### Train the Next Generation

Prevent key man risk, or relying on just one or a few individuals, by training the next generation of leaders. Whether it’s on a team level or organizational level, build a machine that can work well without you. Dalio says there are three things you can do: First, have at least one person who can replace each key person, just as you have backup parts for machines. Second, expose the next generation of leaders to the thinking and decision-making of current leaders. Third, have the successors do aspects of their managers’ jobs for a while to get vetted. Beware of people who don’t cultivate their successors—they likely want to hold onto power and want their subordinates to stay dependent.

(Shortform note: If a complementary leader is set to take over another role—for example, a COO who’s being groomed to be the CEO—[make the succession process as smooth as possible](https://hbr.org/2007/04/the-leadership-team-complementary-strengths-or-conflicting-agendas) by gradually transferring responsibilities. Another option is to “role-swap,” or allow the COO to retain their responsibilities under the title of CEO, while having the new COO take over complementary tasks.)
