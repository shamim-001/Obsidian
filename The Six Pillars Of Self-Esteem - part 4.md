# The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Part 4 | Chapters 13-16: How to Nurture Self-Esteem in Others

You’ve now learned about how others influence _your_ self-esteem—but how can _you_ influence _others’_ self-esteem? In Part 4, you’ll first learn the influence parents have on our self-esteem and Branden’s recommendations for helping your children develop healthy self-esteem. Then, we’ll explore the roles that schools, companies, and psychotherapists play in nurturing others’ self-esteem.

### How Parents Can Nurture Self-Esteem

Branden discusses the influence that parents have on their children’s self-esteem. In this section, we’ll first discuss the main goals of parenting with regard to helping children develop self-esteem. Then, we’ll discuss the specific practices parents should implement to help their kids develop self-esteem.

Branden contends that **proper parenting should provide children with the skills and beliefs they need to behave in ways that generate self-esteem.** Newborns are like blank slates who are on a journey to discover themselves—in other words, to reach the final stage of psychological development, when they are autonomous adults with healthy self-esteem. If the parent doesn’t fulfill his duty to provide optimal conditions for this journey, he damages the child’s still-developing self. Unless this damage is rectified, the child grows into an adult who is in an arrested stage of psychological development—and whose self-esteem is unhealthy. Of course, these children can still adopt behavior that nurtures their self-esteem, so parenting doesn’t _determine_ a child’s self-esteem, but it can support or hamper it.

(Shortform note: To encourage self-esteem-supporting behavior in your kids, try promoting [healthy striving](https://shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly/chapter-7#tool-5-the-foundation-for-healthy-striving-habits), which Brené Brown defines in _[Daring Greatly](https://shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly/)_ as the drive to become the best version of yourself based on your own—not others’—standards. Brown warns that since children are so vulnerable, teaching them to judge themselves by others’ standards may [unintentionally shame](https://shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly/chapter-7#how-parents-unintentionally-harm-their-children) them, which traumatizes them and damages their self-esteem.)

One of the main ways to foster children’s self-esteem is to **make the child feel “seen,” or understood—**which is a common theme among the specific parenting behaviors Branden recommends. He explains that, since we can’t know with certainty if our experiences of ourselves are objectively true, we look to others’ reactions to us to determine how accurate they are. Children, who are still developing, do this with their parents: When their parents’ reactions reflect what they experience and believe, they feel understood, which makes them feel that they are special and that they belong. But if the parents’ reaction does not reflect what they believe, they feel misunderstood and “invisible,” which harms their self-esteem.

(Shortform note: Parenting experts add that [making your child feel understood has other benefits](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/the-importance-of-showing-empathy-to-kids-with-learning-and-thinking-differences): A child who feels understood is one who communicates his needs, remains motivated, and is more self-aware.)

Making a child feel seen doesn’t involve agreeing with everything they do. You can still criticize them, but your reaction can’t make the child’s belief seem absurd. For example, don’t provide overblown praise for an objectively mediocre achievement.

(Shortform note: One psychologist notes that [if your child’s action reminds you of a traumatic experience, you may overreact](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/special-matters/201910/parenting-our-childhood-wounds) and criticize them more harshly than warranted. She recommends identifying your triggers, and if your child engages in them, take a moment to collect yourself so that you don’t overreact.)

But what are the _specific_ behaviors parents should perform to help their children generate self-esteem? Branden recommends focusing on the following.

**1. Parents should provide an environment where their child feels safe—**both physically, with proper food and shelter, and emotionally. In part, this involves creating a _predictable_ environment. The rules don’t constantly change and the parents act relatively stably. Growing up in a predictable environment supports the development of self-efficacy: If I can accurately predict what will happen in my home, I learn that my mind is useful and trustworthy—and when I trust my mind, I grow confident in my capability.

**(**Shortform note: In _[Attached](https://shortform.com/app/book/attached/)_, Levine and Heller add that [growing up in a predictable environment also encourages secure attachment](https://shortform.com/app/book/attached/chapter-1#childhood-attachment-versus-adult-attachment), which [studies show correlates positively with self-esteem](https://tpcjournal.nbcc.org/attachment-self-esteem-and-psychological-distress-a-multiple-mediator-model/): If your parents are available and responsive to your needs, you develop an expectation that others will also care about your needs.)

**2. Parents should express love** through their words, behavior, and emotions**.** A child who receives love learns that they are worthy of love; a child who doesn’t receive love learns that they are unworthy of love.

(Shortform note: Try learning your child’s love language, which Gary Chapman defines in _[The 5 Love Languages](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-5-love-languages/)_ as [the types of actions that make him feel the most loved](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-5-love-languages/1-page-summary#how-to-rebuild-love). Chapman’s book focuses on how to speak your partner’s love language, but his advice is applicable to everybody—including your children.)

Expressing love through touch is especially effective. This is partly because touch is preverbal, so you can use it on children who are too young to understand words. Additionally, touch is physical: If you lovingly touch me, I know that you love _me_—not some abstract version of me—because I can feel you doing so. Children who are touch-deprived often don’t feel loved; they think that someone who _really_ loved them would touch them.

(Shortform note: Touch may also be effective because of its physiological effects: [Being touched lowers your heart rate, relaxes you, and encourages dopamine](https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/the-lasting-damage-of-depriving-a-child-of-human-touch.html), a hormone related to pleasure.)

**3. Parents should accept their children** by listening to and recognizing what the child wants, feels, and thinks. Branden explains that children who are accepted learn to accept themselves. In contrast, children whose parents reject them learn to reject themselves: They agree with their parents so as not to lose their love. You don’t have to be enthusiastic about or agree with every desire your child has. For example, you don’t have to love football because your kid wants to play professionally. But you _do_ have to accept that he loves it.

(Shortform note: Modern psychologists emphasize that [recognizing and accepting your child’s needs doesn’t mean always giving in to their desires](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-power-prime/201001/parenting-respect-starts-home)—a parenting strategy that can backfire because it ultimately diminishes the respect your kids have for you.)

**4.** **Parents should respect their children** by treating them politely: Don’t use language to your child that you would never use to an adult—like telling her she’s “dumb” for forgetting something. Branden explains that by treating your child and the people around them with respect, your child learns that it’s standard to treat both themselves and others with respect.

(Shortform note: Modern parenting experts argue that, in an attempt to respect their children, many parents have gone too far in the other direction: [Parents ask children to do things instead of telling them what to do](https://www.macleans.ca/society/the-collapse-of-parenting-why-its-time-for-parents-to-grow-up/). This strategy works for trivial decisions, but not for important decisions like eating healthily. For example, children who are _asked_ to eat healthily learn that they’re in control and only eat what they want, which can lead to long-term health issues.)

**5. Parents should provide their children with reasonable rules and expectations.** You should be able to explain why these rules exist and update them to age-appropriate levels as your child grows. Branden rejects the notion that letting your child run free encourages healthy self-esteem. Instead, he contends that by setting boundaries, you reassure children that they’re safe because someone appropriate is in control. So _boundaries_ encourage self-esteem; a lack of boundaries encourages not self-esteem but insecurity and anxiety.

(Shortform note: In _[12 Rules for Life](https://shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life/)_, Peterson contends that [by not teaching your kids boundaries, you’re effectively outsourcing that training to society](https://shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life/rule-5#parents-who-fail-to-teach-their-kids), which is far less tolerant than you are. For example, if you don’t teach your child how to control her temper, other children may refuse to play with her.)

**6. Parents should praise their children descriptively, or “appreciatively,” instead of judgmentally, or “evaluatively.”** Branden contends that if your praise includes some kind of judgment, you create dependence: The child learns to evaluate their worth by _what others think_. But if you praise a child without expressing judgment, you both encourage behavior that supports self-esteem and teach the child to rely on their _own_ judgment—which encourages self-esteem. To do this **specifically describe the praiseworthy behavior, then let the child draw their own conclusions**. For example, if a picky eater tries broccoli for the first time, say, “You couldn’t touch anything green three weeks ago, but today you ate broccoli.” The child will conclude that they did a good job—and since you’re praising their efforts, they’re more likely to expend effort in the future.

(Shortform note: Similarly, in _[Mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset/)_, psychologist Carol Dweck recommends [praising your children for what they’ve achieved through practice and persistence](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset/chapter-7-part-2#how-to-praise-children), keeping your focus on _how_ they succeeded or improved. Dweck explains that if you praise a child’s intelligence or ability, you imply you’re proud of them for some inherent trait—and [your child may develop resistance to difficult challenges](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset/chapter-7-part-2#messages-about-success-when-praise-hurts) that may expose that trait’s weakness.)

**7. Parents should criticize their children’s _behavior_ instead of judging the child.** To do so, state the behavior, state how you feel about the behavior, then state how he can make amends (if applicable). Don’t globalize a single behavior and use it to judge him. For example, don’t tell him he’s lazy because he overslept. This will make your child feel rejected and thus unloved or unworthy, which will reduce his self-esteem. Moreover, if your child _believes_ your judgment, he’s more likely to act like what you say he is: If you say he’s mean, he’ll believe he’s mean and so act meanly.

(Shortform note: In _[No-Drama Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-drama-discipline/)_, parenting experts Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson recommend approaching parenting mindfully. When your child misbehaves, first [ask yourself why your child did what he did](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-drama-discipline/1-page-summary#preparation-strategy-2-be-mindful) to avoid blowing up at him.)

**8. Parents should encourage a healthy attitude toward mistakes**. When your child errs, accept the error instead of reprimanding them. And don’t try to fix the child’s error, either. Give your children the tools they need to rectify the mistake on their own, like by asking leading questions.

(Shortform note: In _[Mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset)_, Dweck explains that if you have a fixed mindset—a belief that qualities like intelligence are innate and unchangeable—it may be difficult to encourage a healthy attitude toward mistakes because you [struggle with failure](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset#success-and-failure). She recommends [developing a growth mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset#the-two-mindsets)—a belief that you can improve your abilities—by [creating a fixed-mindset persona](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindset#the-two-mindsets) to remind you that this isn’t who you want to be.)

Branden warns that **unhealthy attitudes toward mistakes lead to damaged self-esteem**. Errors are necessary to learning: You must err repeatedly as you practice a skill so you can eventually master it. But if you reject a child whenever he slips up, he may start to reject himself whenever he errs—which reduces his self-esteem. And if you don’t let a child make his own mistakes, he may learn that learning is less important than not failing. This limits his ability to practice several behaviors that generate self-esteem, like self-assertiveness. (As you may recall, one way to be self-assertive is to try to master life’s challenges head-on.)

(Shortform note: In _[The Confidence Code](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code/)_, Kay and Shipman contend that you can improve your child’s comfort with mistakes by [exposing them to risk slowly](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-confidence-code/chapter-6#building-confidence-in-children)—then being intentional and constructive when they inevitably fail. For example, don’t push your child off a boat to teach her how to swim; take her to the pool and let her practice without yelling at her for being a bad swimmer.)

Branden adds that, in addition to the behaviors listed above, **parents should work on their own self-esteem**. This is partly because you can only make your child feel understood if you accurately _see_ what’s happening; this requires you to practice consciousness, which is essential to self-esteem. Additionally, Branden notes, children learn from what their parents _do_—so the best way to teach healthy self-esteem is to _have_ healthy self-esteem. Try implementing the pillars discussed in Part 2 in your interactions with your children. This will help improve both their and your own self-esteem. For example, if you operate with more consciousness towards your children, you’ll help improve their self-esteem by making them feel more seen.

(Shortform note: Working on your self-esteem may be particularly important for new mothers, especially if they have multiple children: A Norwegian study found that [mothers’ self-esteem increased for the first six months of their baby’s life—but then steadily declined](https://osf.io/xv4np/) until their child turned 3. (The study didn’t follow the mothers long-term, so it’s unclear how their self-esteem may fluctuate throughout their children’s life.) Even if your youngest children don’t remember your self-esteem in their earliest years, your older children are more likely to pay attention to and emulate the example you’re setting.)

### How Schools Can Improve Self-Esteem

Branden contends that schools can be an excellent place to promote self-esteem. In this section, you’ll learn _why_ schools are a good place to teach self-esteem—and the three levels on which schools can promote self-esteem.

Branden writes that **schools are ripe with opportunities to promote or harm the self-esteem of their students.** Many parents are emotionally unable to teach their children the skills and beliefs necessary to achieve healthy self-esteem. Schools can rectify this gap and guide their students towards healthy self-esteem—or, if they misstep, they can reinforce the harmful behaviors learned at home and further impair their students’ psychological development.

(Shortform note: In particular, [researchers have highlighted how school-sponsored extracurricular activities can promote self-esteem](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A288428958&v=2.1&it=r&sid=AONE&asid=15404b5d) by giving students opportunities to engage in what Branden would call self-esteem-supporting behaviors, like taking on challenges.)

(Shortform note: Students come to school with varying degrees of self-esteem—so how can educators tell who might have low self-esteem and need extra support? The American Psychological Association suggests that [students with low self-esteem may shy away from anything new, insult themselves, or avoid anything they may struggle with](https://www.apa.org/ed/schools/primer/self-esteem.pdf).)

So how can schools effectively teach their students self-esteem? Branden says that to do so, schools must support self-esteem on three levels.

#### Level 1: The Curricular Level

On the macro level, Branden argues that **educators should make building self-esteem a major educational objective**. Schools are meant to provide their students with the tools necessary for success, and in the modern workforce, you need _self-esteem_ to succeed. For example, many modern jobs require you to make judgment calls—which you can only do if you trust your own mind and thus have self-esteem.

However, schools are designed to teach compliance over self-esteem because that was necessary for success in previous labor markets: Back when most people worked in factories, you succeeded if you followed orders well. But this system doesn’t work anymore.

(Shortform note: The findings of one 2019 McKinsey study suggest that, in the nearly 30 years since _Six Pillars_ was published, schools have _not_ updated their curricula to provide students with these skills. [Over half of companies struggle to hire employees who can solve problems or are adaptable](https://www.forbesindia.com/blog/education/to-cultivate-a-productive-future-workforce-schools-must-teach-socio-emotional-skills/)—both skills that require self-esteem.)

So how, exactly, can schools adjust their curricula to teach self-esteem? Branden suggests three main additions.

**1. Schools should teach children how to feel and accept their emotions without acting on them.** Many children are rejected by their parents when they express emotion—so they learn that certain emotions are bad and should be suppressed or ignored to avoid parental rejection. By teaching children how to properly deal with their feelings, schools can prevent these kids from growing into adults who always suppress or ignore their emotions—in other words, who live in self-rejecting ways that damage their self-esteem.

(Shortform note: In contrast, psychologist Daniel Goleman suggests that _acting_ on negative emotions appropriately is the key to utilizing them effectively. In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence)_, Goleman explains that [some students succeed by using their anxiety as a source of motivation](https://shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-6-4#anxiety-in-the-classroom). In fact, there’s an ideal peak of useful anxiety in which the amount of nervousness propels the worrier toward excellence.)

**2. Schools should teach children how to have healthy relationships** because healthy self-esteem requires confidence in your ability to do so. (Shortform note: Researchers add that [teaching children how to have healthy relationships in school may also reduce domestic violence](https://theconversation.com/healthy-relationships-education-offers-a-real-chance-to-reduce-domestic-violence-96070) among young people.)

**3. Schools should teach children critical thinking skills** because, in a world that depends on knowledge work, students must learn how to use their minds effectively in order to survive. (Shortform note: One technology company adds that [teaching critical thinking to kids can also help them detect and avoid misinformation on the internet](https://learnsafe.com/why-schools-should-teach-critical-thinking-on-the-internet/), which could lead them to avoid dangerous situations like meeting a stranger from the web.)

#### Level 2: The Teacher’s Self-Esteem

At the teacher level, Branden contends that **teachers who want to increase their students’ self-esteem must first improve their own self-esteem** by following the six pillars laid out in Part 2**.** Kids imitate the adults in their lives—so if their teacher has healthy self-esteem, they’re more likely to imitate and learn the behaviors that support it.

Additionally, teachers provide the greatest value to their students by _believing_ in their potential—so much so that the student comes to believe in her own potential, too, even if she didn’t at first. When a student believes in her own potential, she believes that she is _worthy_ and capable of doing more—in other words, she has greater self-esteem. In order for a teacher to believe in someone else that strongly, Branden argues, he must believe in himself first—in other words, he must have self-esteem.

> **How Improving Teachers’ Mental Health Affects Students** Although few modern studies have specifically examined whether a teacher’s level of self-esteem affects his students’ self-esteem levels, one study suggests that [improving teachers’ mental health has multifaceted benefits for students](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-teachers-need-therapy-their-schools-should-pay-for-it/2021/10): When teachers and administrators at one school were given access to free therapy sessions, all of them reported an increase in their own mental health as well as improvements in their students’ mental health and academic success.
> 
> Researchers suggest that the schools’ prioritization of their employees’ mental health also may have promoted teacher retention: The year after this program began, 10% of the teachers quit—12% less than the previous year. This suggests that instead of relying on teachers to improve their self-esteem on their own, schools can benefit from providing programs that support teachers’ self-esteem, too. After all, if a teacher quits, their self-esteem boost no longer benefits students.

#### Level 3: The Classroom Level

In addition to supporting each student’s self-esteem with self-esteem-nurturing curricular changes and teachers, Branden argues that schools can support self-esteem on a micro level. To do so, **each teacher must ensure that their classroom is an environment that supports self-esteem**. Teachers can do so by following five simple rules.

(Shortform note: Supporting self-esteem in your classroom may also improve your students’ grades. Studies suggest that [students with higher self-esteem are more academically engaged,](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.690828/full) which can improve academic performance.)

**1: Treat every student with respect**. Branden contends that many adults treat children with disrespect they would never direct towards adults. So by treating your students with respect, you reinforce their sense of self-worth and support their self-esteem**.** (Shortform note: One simple way to let your students know that they matter is to [use their names whenever you speak to them](https://online.mc.edu/degrees/education/med/leadership/importance-of-positive-regard-in-education/).)

**2: Treat every student the same.** A child who thinks that their teacher will treat every student fairly feels safe and confident in their capability to handle the classroom; a child who thinks their teacher plays favorites doesn’t have this sense of safety or confidence. (Shortform note: As Jennifer Eberhardt notes in _[Biased](https://shortform.com/app/book/biased)_, you may [treat your students differently due to your unconscious racial biases](https://shortform.com/app/book/biased/chapter-8#antiblack-bias-in-schools-is-very-real). To mitigate this bias, attend [empathy-focused training sessions](https://shortform.com/app/book/biased/chapter-8#how-to-reduce-bias-in-schools), during which you listen to students’ stories about experiencing discrimination in schools and learn strategies for prioritizing a healthy, balanced relationship with your students.)

**3: Focus on what your students are good at** to help students gain confidence in their own value. Branden notes that this may involve helping your students _realize_ what their strengths are if they don’t know them yet.

(Shortform note: To determine what your students are good at, some educators recommend [looking for the subjects in which they demonstrate “brilliant behaviors.”](http://possibilitiesforlearning.com/brilliant-behaviors/) For example, they may ask particularly thoughtful questions about a given topic or be unusually focused on it.)

**4: Notice every student.** Branden explains that every child needs to feel like she’s significant. You can send that message by paying attention to _every_ student in your class—especially the smart, shy ones. These kids often don’t receive much attention from adults, so they start to believe they’re insignificant, which damages their self-esteem.

(Shortform note: You can make your students feel significant by tailoring your classroom activities to their interests. To do so, educators recommend [asking your students to fill out questionnaires about themselves](https://www.edutopia.org/article/6-exercises-get-know-your-students-better-and-increase-their-engagement)—like their favorite foods or songs—so you can get to know them better.)

**5: Be careful how you administer authority.** In any classroom, kids will misbehave. As a teacher, you must strike a balance when dealing with these infractions: You can’t insult them as it would damage their self-worth and thus their self-esteem. But you can’t overlook these infractions either—teaching kids that they can get away with anything discourages self-responsibility and likewise damages their self-esteem.

(Shortform note: Branden’s recommendation may have been influenced by the educational climate of the 1990s, when many schools adopted “zero tolerance” policies and severely punished even the smallest infractions. Research suggests that [this imbalanced approach, when it increases expulsion and suspension, doesn’t improve student behavior](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/zero-tolerance-vs-balanced-school-discipline-russ-skiba).)

Branden recommends two ways to strike that balance. First, he urges, **teach your students _why_ specific rules exist.** A child who understands _why_ a rule exists is more likely to follow the rule because she’s contributing to an environment she wants. For example, if she knows that you must raise your hand to speak so that everybody gets a fair chance to speak, she follows the rule because she _wants_ to be in a classroom where everybody can speak. In other words, in following the rule, she’s exercising her own power for a desired outcome—and so she’s practicing self-esteem-supporting behavior. In contrast, if she follows a rule because she’s afraid of being punished, her actions are motivated by fear or avoidance of punishment, which does not contribute to her self-esteem.

(Shortform note: In _[Indistractable](https://shortform.com/app/book/indistractable)_, productivity expert Nir Eyal recommends a similar approach to parents who want to reduce their kids’ screen time. Teach kids that it’s up to _them_ to make smart decisions about their time because the apps are designed by people who don’t have their best interests in mind. Eyal even recommends that [kids determine their own screen time limits](https://shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/application-2#step-4-precommitments)—this way, the child learns to self-regulate and will stick to these limits even if the parents aren’t able to enforce them. This likely further supports the child’s self-esteem because she’s exercising her own power for an outcome she decided on.)

Second, Branden recommends, **instead of punishing kids, let them live out the consequences of their infractions** so that they’re more motivated to follow the rules. For example, if a disruptive student breaks something, make them fix it.

(Shortform note: The same disciplinary action can be viewed as a punishment or a logical consequence, depending on how it’s used. For example, most people assume that a time-out is a punishment. But one resource for teachers contends that [time-outs are logical consequences—not punishments](https://www.weareteachers.com/logical-consequences-in-the-classroom-2/)—because in a time-out, you ask the child to calm down and think about their actions.)

### How Companies Can Improve Self-Esteem

Branden argues that companies should foster the self-esteem of their employees. In this section, we’ll first discuss _why_ self-esteem has grown essential to economic success. Then, we’ll discuss what companies can do to promote self-esteem.

As discussed in Part 1, Branden contends that **self-esteem has become essential to economic success due to the new demands of the knowledge economy.** In the manufacturing economy, companies succeeded by having a few leaders who made impactful decisions and a large workforce that obeyed orders. But this isn’t enough to succeed in a world that values _knowledge_ and _ideas_. In such a world, companies must keep up with constantly changing realities and ever-increasing global competition—which requires employees with high self-esteem.

Branden explains that **employees at every level of the organization must be able to learn quickly and make effective decisions** instead of relying on orders from the top. In order to keep up with constantly changing realities, companies must learn quickly, predict and detect problems, and solve them fast. They need employees who can identify and seize every opportunity they have to come up with new ideas. Similarly, companies can only succeed in a globalized world if their employees are acting _consciously_. They cannot get too comfortable at the top; they must always remain aware of and respond appropriately to new developments. All of these skills, as we’ve seen, are only possible if you have self-esteem.

So what must organizations do to promote self-esteem and ensure their economic success? Branden makes the following recommendations:

**1. Create a culture that fosters innovation and initiative.** To do so, managers should encourage their employees to see problems as opportunities, not challenges. They should also give employees the power and materials they need to do their jobs and to innovate when necessary. Managers must also budget enough money to _implement_ new innovations. Employees whose creativity is never rewarded will eventually grow disheartened and may lose their creativity altogether.

**2. Create a culture that allows people to lack knowledge and to fail.** To do so, managers should set an example: Admit when you don’t know something, and apologize if you fail—but treat it as an opportunity for growth. Branden adds that company policies shouldn’t excessively punish failure: Making the damage of failing greater than the reward of success deters people from taking risks.

**3. Create a rational environment:** An environment that people can make sense of is one that supports people’s trust in their own mind. Companies can support rational environments with policies that prioritize fairness and integrity. Managers can support rational environments by clearly laying out what employees must do, explaining _why_ those rules and expectations exist, and respectfully disciplining those who don’t follow them.

**4. Create a culture that values people** by treating people with respect and acknowledging their contributions. To do so, managers should convey respect and empathy in all interactions. They should also reward good work with promotions, pay raises, and public praise

**5. Create a culture that promotes learning and development.** To do so, managers should assign employees projects that align with their interests and assets—but that sometimes require their employees to grow in order to successfully complete them.

> **The Power of Promoting Self-Esteem: The Policies That Helped Netflix Succeed**
> 
> In _[No Rules Rules](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules)_, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and business professor Erin Meyer describe how Netflix used these recommendations to create a company culture that empowered employees. And, just as Branden contends, Hastings credits this self-esteem-supporting culture with turning the company into a streaming giant that has more than 200 million subscribers across 190 countries, creates award-winning content, and is consistently listed among the best places to work.

Some notable Netflix policies that support self-esteem—which you may consider implementing in your own company—include the following:

**Netflix fosters innovation and initiative** by [letting employees propose and test big ideas](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-6#employees-have-both-autonomy-and-accountability)—even if their bosses disagree. This same policy encourages learning and development: Although employees can pursue projects they’re interested in, they’re expected to learn from their failures to avoid repeating their mistakes.

> **Netflix supports a rational environment** by [asking employees to act in the company’s best interests](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/chapter-8#policy-employees-must-act-in-the-companys-best-interest) instead of having strict travel and expense policies.This prioritizes fairness by allowing people to make wise decisions. For example, an employee who has a big presentation in an unusually expensive location can stay in a decent hotel without worrying about spending limits—and this employee feels fairly compensated instead of griping that he has to have a terrible night’s sleep even though his presentation is _for_ the company. Moreover, managers periodically check their employees’ expenses and correct any employees who’ve gone overboard—which amounts to respectful discipline that works: After a few conversations, employees tighten up their spending.

In addition to the above, Branden argues, **both the leader of the company and individual managers must work on their own self-esteem.** The leader sets the tone for how the entire company behaves. For example, if the leader fears failure, the company will learn to do the same because that’s what the leader has shown she values. As such, a leader who wants to create a company that supports self-esteem must improve her own self-esteem so that she can transmit those values down the chain of command. The same is true of managers, who lack the full influence of the company leader but still influence everybody they interact with.

(Shortform note: Branden’s argument suggests you should avoid working for leaders with low self-esteem—but how do you assess that? One leadership expert presents [four warning signs that your manager has low self-esteem](https://www.d2l.com/blog/4-ways-detect-leaders-low-self-esteem/): 1. She micromanages her employees. 2. She takes all the credit for others’ ideas. 3. She is mean to her employees. 4. She only supports ideas that come from people higher on the corporate ladder than she is.)

### How Psychotherapists Can Help Improve Self-Esteem

In Chapter 16, Branden explains how psychotherapists can help their clients improve their levels of self-esteem. In this section, you’ll first learn why Branden thinks self-esteem should be a main goal of psychotherapy. Then, you’ll learn the ways he recommends psychotherapists modify their practices so that they can improve their clients’ self-esteem.

Branden argues that **psychotherapists should make building self-esteem one of their main goals** for two main reasons. First, he says that many psychological issues stem from unhealthy self-esteem. For example, he writes that shyness comes from a lack of self-assertion—or a lack of self-esteem—while aggression occurs when people try to pretend that they have self-esteem when they don’t. So building self-esteem would help repair these psychological issues. Second, Branden argues that psychotherapy has two main goals: reduce suffering and uncover strengths. Building self-esteem accomplishes both of these goals.

> **How Modern Psychologists Think Self-Esteem Affects Shyness and Aggression**
> 
> Generally speaking, [psychologists agree that low self-esteem contributes to shyness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8744881/), but they’re divided on how aggression relates to self-esteem levels. Some contend that low self-esteem contributes to aggression, while others contend that high self-esteem does so.
> 
> One study revealed that [this difference stems from a lack of consensus on how to define self-esteem](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:37801/FULLTEXT01.pdf). Psychologists who link aggression to low self-esteem equate self-esteem with your general self-opinion. In contrast, psychologists who attribute aggression to high self-esteem define self-esteem as the level of confidence you have in a particular skill set (for example, if you think you’re socially skilled). They contend that this type of high self-esteem may spark aggression if others don’t agree with your self-evaluation, leading you to act out.

(Shortform note: One study suggests that framing the treatment goals as an attempt to live a life that’s more closely aligned with their values [may increase how engaged the clients are](https://societyforpsychotherapy.org/framing-treatment-goals-with-clients/)—even if the psychotherapist doesn’t change the _content_ of her treatment.)

So how, exactly, can psychotherapists help their clients improve their self-esteem? Branden makes several recommendations that we’ve listed below.

**1. Respect the client**, no matter how poorly the client acts. By respecting the client, psychotherapists treat the client as somebody who is fundamentally worthy as a human being. This can encourage the client to _believe_ they are fundamentally worthy—and, as we’ve seen, such a belief is essential to self-esteem.

(Shortform note: Therapists can [show respect to their patients](https://www.counsellingconnection.com/index.php/2009/09/08/respect-for-the-client/) by using appropriate language (for example, not cursing), accepting their clients’ beliefs and values without judgment, not rushing clients to say more than they feel comfortable revealing, and not allowing the relationship to move beyond a professional context.)

**2**. **Help your clients _figure out_** **what they need to learn, instead of _telling_ them what they need to learn.** For example, don’t _tell_ them that nobody’s coming to save them—_lead_ them to that realization. Telling your client what to do may teach the client what they need to learn, which builds self-esteem—but it robs them of the opportunity to reach that insight themselves, which improves self-efficacy and thus self-esteem. Moreover, when telling the client what to do, you risk letting your personal desire for adulation bleed into your profession and subtly judging the client. If you judge the client, you undermine the environment of respect you are trying to create.

(Shortform note: Other professionals add that [telling your clients what they need to learn or do ultimately harms your client](https://acceleratedresolutiontherapy.com/therapists-dont-give-advice-clients/) because it doesn’t empower them to make their own decisions. As a therapist, your job is to help your clients understand why they act the way they do so that they can make better decisions in the future—even if you’re not there.)

**3. Focus on discovering the client’s strengths.** To encourage self-esteem, Branden recommends that you help clients discover their untapped potential so that they can do better in life. This potential may be hidden simply because it has not yet been uncovered or because the client is repressing it for whatever reason. If it’s the latter, psychotherapists can help clients work through this repression by giving them sentence stems like the following.

- The bad thing about admitting my strengths is…
- If I were to bring my strengths to bear on my problems…

(Shortform note: Today, therapy that helps clients discover their strengths is known as [strengths-based therapy, which research shows improves self-esteem](https://www.verywellmind.com/strengths-based-therapy-definition-and-techniques-5211679). While some of these therapists may use sentence-completion work, strengths journaling is more common: The client writes about how their strengths have improved their lives, which leads them to grow more aware of how these qualities are helping them now.)

**4. Teach your clients that they perform negative behaviors because those behaviors provided some immediate benefit when they were first developed—even though they may cause long-term harm.** For example, a child whose parent yells at him for expressing emotion learns to stop expressing emotion. This benefits him in the short term because he avoids parental rejection, but it may cause long-term harm if he grows into an adult who can’t express emotion. A client who understands _why_ he behaves in some unhealthy way is far less likely to berate himself for that behavior—a self-rejecting act that makes it even harder to improve these behaviors. He’s also finally able to see why this unhealthy behavior no longer benefits him—and grows more open to considering alternatives.

(Shortform note: The mere fact that you engage in self-destructive behaviors—which provide immediate benefit but cause long-term harm—may be evidence of a simultaneously negative and positive quality. Research suggests that [people who engage in self-destructive behaviors feel emotions more powerfully than others](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-self-destructive-behavior/201512/understanding-self-destructive-dysregulated-behaviors), but feeling emotions powerfully is also associated with positive qualities like greater empathy and creativity. Understanding these positive effects may reduce how likely you are to berate yourself for self-destructive behavior.)

**5. Teach your clients how to recognize and unite subselves**. Branden contends that everybody has subselves, which are like mini-personalities that we’ve internalized, and that often kick in when we face particular situations. Imagine yourself as a group of friends on a road trip: Your conscious self is the main driver, but each of your subselves occasionally takes over the driving.

Each of these personalities is _specific to you_. For example, Branden discusses the mother-self, which is an internalized version of _your mother_—not a generic mother figure. When you hear your mother’s voice in your head telling you not to do something, that’s your mother-self talking to you. In addition to a mother-self and father-self, you have subselves that represent internalized versions of you as a child, a teenager, and the opposite gender (your feminine side if you’re a man, or your masculine side if you’re a woman).

Branden argues that **we can only accept ourselves—and thus gain self-esteem—if we become aware of and accept all our subselves and learn to unify them with our conscious self.** This can be a difficult task because we may want to reject our subselves. For example, if you hated your mother, you probably dislike the idea that you have a mother-self. Even if you accept that your subself exists, you may hear your mother’s voice in your head and yell at it. But since your mother-self is _part of you_, rejecting that self or behaving in ways that demean it means that you are rejecting _your_self, which damages your self-esteem.

Psychotherapists must help clients face each subself, accept it, and discover what it needs so that their conscious self can meet its needs in their relationship. In this way, you learn to treat each subself with kindness.

> **How Other Psychologists Talk About Subselves**
> 
> Other psychologists have also suggested that we have subselves that we must identify and accept in order to improve our lives, but their explanations of subselves differ from Branden’s in a few ways.
> 
> For example, in _[The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook](https://www.newharbinger.com/9781684034833/the-anxiety-and-phobia-workbook/)_, Edmund Bourne proposes that **there are four subpersonalities that may induce anxiety**: the worrier, the critic, the victim, and the perfectionist. While Branden asserts that subselves are unique to each person, Bourne posits that these four subpersonalities represent archetypes that work the same way in everybody. For example, if Lisa and Tina have different mothers, Branden’s theory dictates that they have different mother-selves. But Lisa and Tina both have the critic, which treats both the same way: It lowers their self-opinions by judging them harshly.
> 
> Additionally, while Bourne recommends identifying and accepting our subselves, he doesn’t argue that you must learn to unify them with your conscious self. Rather, he focuses on ways to _overcome_ these subselves so that they stop distorting your thoughts and inducing unnecessary anxiety. To do so, Bourne recommends that you stop overanalyzing and just do whatever you want. You may also consider [growing mindful of harmful thoughts so that you can objectively analyze and interrupt them if necessary](https://lonerwolf.com/subpersonalities-self-fulfillment/).
