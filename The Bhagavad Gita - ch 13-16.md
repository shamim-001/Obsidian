## Chapters 13-16: The Body Creates Spiritual Obstacles

This section begins by exploring two ideas: the so-called “field,” and the one who knows the field. In the simplest terms, we could think of the field as the body, and the knower as the true self that inhabits that body.

Krishna then returns to the subject of the gunas, this time to discuss how living by each guna affects your next life. While on the topic of reincarnation, he also explains the difference between what he terms “divine” and “demonic” tendencies. People who are driven by divine tendencies show the qualities that he’s been describing all along, like selflessness and spirituality. Those who are driven by demonic tendencies are selfish and atheistic; they don’t believe in God at all, and think that life has no higher purpose than reproduction. As with the gunas, people will be reborn according to their tendencies.

**Understanding the knower of the field—the true self that inhabits the body—is crucial in order to embrace divine tendencies and free oneself from the three gunas.** This is one method of attaining enlightenment.

### The Field and the One Who Knows It

**Krishna compares the temporary body to a farmer’s field, and the true self that lives in it to the farmer—the one who knows and tends the field.** The “field” is made up of a number of different things: the five senses, the five elements (earth, fire, air, water, and akasha), and the five organs of action (the mouth to speak, the feet to move, the hands to work, the anus to excrete, and the sex organs to reproduce).

Beyond physical matter, the field also includes the three components of the mind (_manas_, which experiences and remembers sensory input; _buddhi_, which is intelligence and reason; and _ahamkara_, self-will or sense of self), and the raw energy from which all of those elements were formed. In other words, the field is prakriti. It’s the source of all the temporary sense-objects that pull people from the spiritual path and keep them trapped by karma. However, it’s the Purusha, the soul, which experiences those sense-objects.

Krishna explains that knowing the difference between the field (prakriti) and the knower (Purusha) is crucial to disconnecting oneself from the sense-objects that prakriti creates. He then reiterates that those who understand what the true self is, and that they all come from and are part of Brahman, know that God exists in all of them and that they’re all connected. **Knowing that, they never harm themselves or anyone else.**

Finally, Krishna compares Purusha to the sun rising to illuminate the field. **Even though all sense-objects come from prakriti, the true self is needed in order to animate the body and to experience those things.**

Paradoxically, Krishna is simultaneously the field, the knower, and the supreme force beyond both of them. People who understand that truth have reached the source of all wisdom, and will be able to reach the ultimate goal of freeing themselves from samsara.

### The Gunas and Samsara

Krishna explains that, aside from sense-objects and actions, prakriti is also the source of the three gunas discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. **The gunas are three qualities, or attributes, and every action can be related to one of them.**

As a reminder, the guna of _sattva_ is considered the only positive one. It’s associated with harmony, balance, light, and peace. _Rajas_ is energy, or passion. It fuels desire and drives people to pursue selfish things—although it can also be a powerful motivator. _Tamas_ is associated with darkness, depression, and sloth.

Those who live—and, more importantly, die—experiencing one of the gunas will be reborn according to that guna. Those who die in a state of tamas sink deeper into the cycle and are reborn to an ignorant or unlearned family, likely doomed to continue their downward slide. Those who die consumed by rajas will stay where they are karmically, and be reborn to continue chasing their own desires. Those who die in a state of sattva, of tranquility and harmony, will be reborn among the wise to continue their spiritual journeys.

However, there is a state even better than sattva, and that’s to renounce the gunas entirely. **Those who aren’t driven by any of the three gunas, who have given up all of their personal desires and any attachment to the outcomes of their actions, are able to pass beyond the gunas and rejoin with Vishnu.**

After Krishna finishes this explanation, Arjuna asks what people who have moved beyond the three gunas are like. He wants to know how they behave, and how they managed to break free of the gunas.

Krishna answers that these people are completely unmoved by any of the three gunas. They don’t have any desire to feel sattva’s peace, nor are they driven by rajas’s passion or repulsed by tamas’s indolence. They understand that the gunas are outside forces, not from their true Purusha, and they don’t let any of the three affect their actions.

He then repeats that people who truly understand their Purusha aren’t affected by good or bad times, pleasure or pain. They see the same value in every person and don’t think in terms of friends or enemies. A lump of gold and a plain rock have the same worth to such people. All of this is because they’ve moved beyond the physical concerns of prakriti and dedicate everything to Vishnu and Brahman. He ends by saying that these kinds of people are ready to break out of samsara and be reunited with Brahman.

#### Divine and Demonic Tendencies

**Just like the gunas drive people’s actions, so too do divine and demonic tendencies, and with similar consequences.** Krishna says that what he has been explaining so far—detachment, peace, spirituality, and so on—are divine tendencies. People with these tendencies will be reborn into good families who will nurture their spiritual growth and, eventually, they will stop being reincarnated entirely. Arjuna was born with divine qualities.

However, some people exhibit demonic tendencies instead. These people are driven by lust, anger, and greed. They don’t believe in God, spiritual law, or morality. They think that the only source of life is biological—that is, sex—and that life has no purpose except fulfilling their desires.

Since they don’t believe in any higher power, people with demonic tendencies may come to believe that they themselves are godlike. They’ll see their wealth, their social status, and their material accomplishments as proof that they are better than other people. They may talk about how they’ve proven their power by defeating their rivals, or shown their grace and generosity through offerings and charity. They think that they are destined to get everything they want—however, their desires are insatiable, and they always want more and more.

Krishna says that he casts people who are ruled by their lust, anger, and greed into new lives with families who have the same tendencies. Therefore, they get more and more entrapped by their worst impulses, and never free themselves from karma.

**Krishna urges Arjuna to renounce lust, anger, and greed, and instead to live his life by the scriptures and by Krishna’s teachings.**

#### The Ashvattha Tree and Krishna’s Home

Krishna next talks about the ashvattha tree, a sacred world-tree in Hindu mythology and a way of visualizing all the things that keep people bound to karma. The tree is upside-down, with its roots stretching upward into Brahman and its branches spreading through the universe. Sense-objects grow like buds on the limbs of the ashvattha tree. The tree is fed by the gunas, and it keeps people bound to the outcomes of their actions, tangled in its branches, so that they continue experiencing those gunas.

However, though the tree is strong and its roots are deep, Krishna tells Arjuna that he can cut it down with the axe of detachment. As he’s said before, the key is to act without selfish desire or concern for the outcomes of actions. This, like freedom from the gunas and living by divine tendencies, will help Arjuna to avoid reincarnation.

People who are able to overcome the gunas, their demonic tendencies, and free themselves from the Ashvattha tree join Vishnu in his true home, never to be reborn again. **Krishna now describes that home, the place where souls who free themselves from samsara end up.** He describes it as a place of light; not the light of the sun, the moon, or fire, but the pure light of the true self. And, since all souls come from him, the light is also Krishna himself. Beyond that, his home is beyond language’s ability to describe.
