## Chapter 6: Release Your Limitations

Now that you understand how to create and focus on successful feelings to improve your self-image, we’ll explore methods you can use to let go of existing negative thought patterns that hold you back from success.

Maltz argues that the more you free yourself from responding to and identifying with negative thoughts—by deliberately creating successful feedback loops like a machine—the more likely you are to develop a happy and successful state of mind.

Your negative traits are nothing to be ashamed of—you originally adopted them as a way to solve a problem or protect yourself from future failures. However, if you wish to move forward and create more success in your life, you do need to make a conscious effort to replace those negative thoughts and feelings with positive thoughts and feelings.

(Shortform note: It’s often difficult to figure out if your thoughts are protecting you or holding you back from happiness. In _[The Work](https://thework.com/instruction-the-work-byron-katie/)_, Byron Katie presents a process to question the rationality of the thoughts and emotions that hold you back from feeling happy and successful. Katie argues that the more you question the validity of your existing negative thoughts and behaviors, the more you free yourself from identifying with them and _relying on them to protect you_. Katie claims that following this process leads to inner peace and empowers you to become the person you want to be.)

Maltz prescribes two methods you can use to replace existing negative thoughts and feelings with positive thoughts and feelings, and redirect yourself towards achieving successful outcomes.

### Method 1: Turn Challenges Into Opportunities to Improve Your Self-Image

A challenge is any situation that takes you out of your comfort zone. It’s important to see this type of situation as an _opportunity_ rather than a _crisis_. Maltz argues that negative personalities often confuse challenges (opportunities to advance) with crises (life-threatening situations) because they’re so sensitive to external stimuli and perceive threats to be bigger than they are. They find excuses to avoid challenges, and they waste time and energy worrying or evading discomforting situations.

Maltz argues that when you feel stressed or anxious—such as when you see a challenge as a crisis—you’re less able to think clearly, find solutions, or react appropriately. Your anxiety literally shuts down your brain and your ability to deal with situations.

According to Maltz, positive personalities recognize the difference between an actual crisis and a challenge. In contrast to the negative personality’s tendency to freeze up, they proactively seek ways to overcome challenges, and they spend their time visualizing and planning how to make the best out of every situation.

**Positive people are more relaxed**: Maltz claims that the more relaxed you are, the more effective you are at dealing with pressure—you’re more able to think clearly and react appropriately and spontaneously to situations that come up. Consequently, if you visualize yourself responding to challenges while in a relaxed state, you’ll be more able to respond to real challenges as and when they come up.

> **Growth Mindset Versus Fixed Mindset**
> 
> In her book _[Mindset](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindset/1-page-summary)_, Carol S. Dweck discusses the difference between “growth mindset” and “fixed mindset”—although Maltz doesn’t use these terms, his theories regarding the way positive and negative personalities respond differently to challenges correspond to these concepts. According to Dweck, the two mindsets describe a person’s attitude to challenges and setbacks:
> 
> - **Growth mindset**: People see challenges as an opportunity to learn—they believe that they can improve their natural abilities through effort and practice, and eventually overcome obstacles.
>     
> - **Fixed mindset**: People see challenges as proof of their inability to achieve success—they believe that they can’t improve their abilities and this prevents them from moving past their limitations.
>     
> 
> Fortunately, Dweck argues that even if you have a tendency toward a fixed mindset, you can develop a growth mindset through conscious awareness and effort. Many of the methods Maltz prescribes complement Dweck’s argument that you can improve the way you approach and overcome the challenges in your life.

#### Prepare to Move Past Your Comfort Zone

Maltz argues you can turn any situation into an opportunity to improve your self-image. The more you practice relaxation and successful visualization, the more likely you’ll be able to perceive challenges in your life as opportunities. He suggests doing this by planning ahead for challenges as much as you can by taking the time to investigate your fears and visualize yourself responding to situations calmly and competently.

For example, you’re thinking about applying for a new job but you feel nervous about getting to the job interview stage. Maltz argues that your negative feelings signal that you haven’t mentally prepared yourself to meet your circumstances, and you’re reactivating memories of past failures rather than memories of past successes. To move past your fears, ask yourself:

- Why are you afraid to apply for this job?
- What can you do to better prepare for this job application?
- How would a successful person approach this job application?
- Knowing what you now know, what can you do to reverse these feelings so that you feel more successful?

Use your answers to better prepare yourself for this challenge—imagine yourself interacting in various job interview scenarios and pre-empt the various questions that may be asked. Practice responding to these questions calmly and confidently—overwrite your fearful thoughts by _practicing feeling successful_ at this job interview.

This state of calm and confidence will carry over into _any_ challenge you meet, not just the job interview—this process trains your mind to calmly solve all problems, and to confidently respond to every new situation and challenge.

> **Focus on Your Fears, Not Your Goals to Achieve Success**
> 
> Like Maltz, Tim Ferriss suggests that you should investigate your fears. But his approach is slightly different—Ferriss argues that [focusing on your worst-case scenarios will empower you to approach any challenge](https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/).
> 
> Ferriss argues that you’re more likely to hold back from taking action when your fears are _unknown_—vague possibilities that could happen. **The more you think about the unknown, the more powerless you feel to overcome your fears**. As a result, you postpone taking steps toward what you want—this inaction leads to feelings of disappointment and regret.
> 
> On the other hand, when you think about what you want to do and define the actual worst-case scenario, you give your mind something specific and productive to work on. If you’re afraid to take action, Ferriss suggests that you:
> 
> - **Envision** your worst-case scenario in detail
>     
> - **Plan** how you would get back in control of the situation
>     
> - **Ask** yourself how you could benefit from this situation
>     
> 
> Your answers to these questions will make you realize that you can overcome anything, even the worst possible thing you can imagine and will provide clues about how to move forward towards your goals.

### Method 2: Practice Reflecting _Only_ on the Facts

Maltz argues that your negative feelings (anxiety, discomfort, lack of self-confidence) are not an indication of reality, just how you _feel_ about reality—and those feelings are a result of your habitual thought process. That is, if you habitually think negative thoughts, you’ll often misunderstand events and draw false conclusions that keep you stuck in a negative feedback loop.

When you feel negative thoughts, feelings, or memories surface, choose to replace them with rational thoughts that encourage positive beliefs. For example, if you find yourself feeling insulted by someone’s comments, Maltz suggests that you ask the following questions:

1. Is there a rational reason for believing that this person intends to insult you?
2. Is it possible that you misinterpreted this person?
3. If someone else had said the same thing, would you have assumed that they were trying to insult you?
4. Is there a good enough reason to feel insulted?

> **Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Challenge Your Negative Thoughts**
> 
> [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.guelphtherapist.ca/blog/cognitive-therapy-challenging-negative-thoughts/) (CBT) helps people examine and challenge their uncomfortable thoughts so that they can find alternative ways to think about their triggers. The more you question the validity of your uncomfortable thoughts, the less likely you are to accept them as truth and allow them to rule your emotions.
> 
> Similar to Maltz’s method, CBT focuses on asking questions to assess the rationality of your uncomfortable thoughts and to explore other perspectives. Unlike Maltz’s general questions, CBT proposes a number of specific questions with concrete answers to help you more easily find clarity in the midst of discomfort:
> 
> **Facts**
> 
> - What evidence is there to support your thoughts about this?
>     
> - What evidence disproves or contradicts your thoughts about this?
>     
> - Are your opinions getting in the way of the facts?
>     
> 
> **Other explanations**
> 
> - Can you think about this differently?
>     
> - Is your mood impacting the way you’re thinking about this?
>     
> - Are you likely to change your opinion about this over time?
>     
> 
> **Moving forward**
> 
> - What impact are these thoughts having on you?
>     
> - Are these thoughts good for you or would you prefer to feel better?
>     
> - What has helped you to feel positive after experiencing similar situations?
>     

#### Delay Automatic Responses

Maltz explains that one way you can train yourself to focus on facts and take control of how you react to situations is by delaying your response to stimuli.

When you consciously delay your response to a stimulus, you interrupt the automatic reaction of your subconscious and give yourself the chance to objectively view the fact, instead of getting caught up in your automatic emotional reaction. This delay gives you the space to calm down, take conscious control over your emotions, and decide how you want to respond. The more you practice delaying your negative reactions, the more control you have over your ability to respond positively and create positive feedback loops. Eventually, you’ll find that things that once triggered you into negative emotional states will no longer have any control over you.

- For example, you automatically get angry and lash out whenever your kids mess up the house. You can take control of this automatic reaction by making a conscious effort to count to ten before saying anything. This gives you the space to separate the fact (the house is a mess) from how you choose to respond—_you don’t have to_ lash out, **you can decide to respond more positively**. For example, you could choose to make this a fun experience by putting on some good music and getting the kids to help you clear up.

> **Use Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) to Calm Your Automatic Responses to Stimuli**
> 
> Maltz argues that you should delay your responses to triggers. This sounds easy, but it’s difficult to practice when you’re in the middle of a trigger. You’re more likely to delay your automatic responses if you find ways to deal with your triggers _before_ you’re faced with them.
> 
> EFT—otherwise known as “tapping” is an effective way to reduce stress and anxiety, and [calm down your response to triggers that upset you](https://www.thetappingsolution.com/tapping-101/). Unlike most self-help programs, EFT doesn’t expect you to just ignore or avoid your negative thoughts and emotions. The process involves:
> 
> - **Accepting** that you feel these emotions and calming your body’s response to them.
>     
> - **Understanding** why certain things trigger you.
>     
> - **Releasing** your negative emotions.
>     
> - **Replacing** your unwanted emotions with calm or positive emotions.
>     
> 
> The first step of the process involves using your fingertips to tap on specific meridian (acupuncture) points on your face and body _while you focus on the negative emotion that you’re feeling_. The process of tapping on these points sends signals to the part of your brain that’s responsible for triggering the stress response in your body.
> 
> When you tap on the points _and_ focus on the negative thought or emotion, your brain automatically calms down its stress response and _associates this feeling of calm with your point of focus_. In other words, your brain no longer feels the need to fuel your negative reactions when you think about this specific emotion or trigger—you’re able to think more calmly and objectively. Once you feel more objective, you then continue to tap on the points until you no longer feel any emotion around the issue.
> 
> This process is often done in advance of a trigger—for example, if you know that you lash out at your kids every time they make a mess, you can tap through the points before you get home or even while you feel the urge to lash out. Each time you follow the process, you’ll become more conscious of how you’re responding to triggers and weaken your automatic responses. As a result, you’ll find it easier to improve your responses and act the way you choose to.

#### Seek Solutions

Another way you can take control of habitually negative thought processes is by making an effort to think _rationally_, not emotionally, about your mistakes. Maltz stresses that **you should never identify with, or think emotionally about, your mistakes**. The only time you should think about your mistakes is when you’re using them constructively, as a rational guide to help reorient yourself towards your goals.

He suggests asking yourself logical questions about the _facts_ of the situation as a way to force yourself to focus on figuring out the real cause of your mistake and your goals instead of focusing on identifying with the mistake. Further, questioning yourself rationally helps you to immediately seek solutions to the mistake so you can bolster your potential for success in the future. This process will turn every mistake and failure into an opportunity to learn and break your pattern of responding negatively to situations.

For example, you failed an exam. You could either mope around and identify with the failure: “I failed my exam (fact), therefore I am a failure (cause).” Or you could just state the fact: “I failed the exam,” and seek the real cause by asking yourself logical questions:

- Why did you fail the exam?
- Were you prepared for the exam?
- How can you better prepare yourself for the next exam?

> **Ask Yourself “What” Instead of “Why”**
> 
> Sometimes, when you’re feeling emotional, it’s difficult to think rationally about a mistake you’ve made. You may inadvertently ask yourself questions that reinforce your errors and the negative emotions you feel.
> 
> According to Tasha Eurich, author of _[Insight](https://www.insight-book.com/)_, you’re more likely to discover effective solutions to your problems, and train yourself away from identifying with your mistakes, when you ask yourself “what” instead of “why” questions in response to mistakes.
> 
> Asking “why” questions about your past mistakes will only lead you to _focus on your failures and errors_. **You may end up engaging emotionally with your mistakes** instead of switching your focus to the success you want to achieve.
> 
> - For example, you failed an exam because you didn’t study, you weren’t prepared enough, or you just didn’t know the right answers. In other words, your responses emphasize that you didn’t do enough and your failure is due to an error on your part.
> 
> On the other hand, asking “what” questions will allow you to bypass the act of focusing on your errors and lead you directly to the solutions you seek to make. This process will allow you to take a step back from your mistakes and **focus objectively on the solutions that will serve you**.
> 
> - For example, asking yourself “what do you need to do to pass the exam?” instead of “why did you fail the exam?” will lead you directly to the actions you need to take to improve your chances of success in the future.

### Method 3: Forgive and Forget

Throughout his work as a plastic surgeon, Maltz noticed that many of his patients suffered more from “emotional scars” than they did from real physical flaws. Some of his patients failed to see the changes in their appearance after surgery because their self-image was so strongly fixated on an imaginary flaw. Maltz concluded that emotional scars are the real cause of distorted and negative self-images, and the only way to move forward is to release them.

(Shortform note: Emotional scars—otherwise known as psychological trauma—result from [situations that threaten your sense of emotional or physical safety](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/ptsd-trauma/coping-with-emotional-and-psychological-trauma.htm#:~:text=Emotional%20and%20psychological%20trauma%20can,unexpected%20or%20happened%20in%20childhood.). Psychologists argue that **your subjective emotional experience of a situation defines whether you find it traumatic**—the more powerless you feel, the more likely you are to feel traumatized and form an emotional scar. This links back to Maltz’s argument that the self-image determines responses to the environment: Someone with a positive self-image responds to life experiences rationally. In contrast, someone with a negative self-image responds to the same experiences irrationally, is more likely to feel threatened, and form emotional scars.)

Maltz argues that an unwillingness or failure to forgive past mistakes and traumas holds people back from experiencing success in their lives—they form “emotional scars” to protect themselves from future hurts and humiliations. These scars don’t protect them, but rather prevent them from experiencing new things and keep them trapped in a state of resentment and misery.

- For example, a partner cheats on you so you hold back from getting close to others. You want to experience love, but your subconscious mind makes it difficult because you’re still feeding it feelings of resentment and pain. As a result, your subconscious doesn’t let you get close to others because you’ve trained it to keep you safe and distant from others.

Forgiveness, on the other hand, heals these emotional scars and allows you to move forward with your life. You need to accept that we all make mistakes and it’s okay—no one’s perfect. Holding onto blame only holds you back from success. **Forgiving yourself and others for past mistakes will liberate you and allow you to focus on where you want to go**.

- For example, after allowing yourself to experience hurt for a short time, you choose to forgive your ex-partner for cheating on you. You accept that it happened but you no longer feel any resentment, or project feelings of distrust onto potential partners. You choose to experience love, and you allow yourself to fearlessly embrace new opportunities, and to engage in meaningful relationships. This increases your chances of experiencing a successful relationship.

The more you practice feeling successful and self-reliant, the less sensitive you’ll be to external circumstances (the things that happen and how people react to you). The more you practice responding to experiences rationally, the less likely you’ll be to form new emotional scars.

> **How to Let Go of Past Grievances**
> 
> In _[How To Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/part-4)_, Dale Carnegie expands upon the idea that you should “forgive and forget” past hurts so that you can move forward and embrace success and happiness. He claims that holding onto past grievances takes away your power because it prevents you from focusing on what you want. These negative feelings can also harm your physical health and produce effects such as high blood pressure and insomnia. Carnegie’s suggestions for releasing grievances, or “emotional scars,” include:
> 
> **Look for the good**: Forgive the person for wronging you and simply stop thinking about them. You’ll achieve this faster if you can find the good in the situation and find something to be grateful for. For example, perhaps you knew deep down that your ex-partner wasn’t “the one” for you but you were too complacent to change the situation. The betrayal was actually a good thing because it put you in a position to find someone more suited to you.
> 
> **Focus on something you’re passionate about**: The more you commit to something you care about, the less likely you are to focus on how others have wronged you.
> 
> **Try to imagine their point of view**: When you allow yourself to think outside of your own worldview, and you consider why that person engaged in the behavior that you’re resenting them for, you open yourself up to empathy and create space to feel compassion for this person, rather than self-pity for yourself.
