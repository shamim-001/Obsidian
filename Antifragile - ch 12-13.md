## Chapters 12-13: Optionality and Rationality

As stated in the previous chapter, optionality—having a variety of choices available—is one key aspect of antifragility. An anecdote in Aristotle’s _Politics_ shows this, although, oddly, Aristotle seems to have gotten exactly the wrong point from his own story.

The philosopher Thales of Miletus was known to be poor and unconcerned with money. However, those around him suspected that the reason for his apparent lack of interest in money was that he simply didn’t have the skill or intelligence to make any. Thales decided to prove them wrong.

He rented out every olive press in the area, which he was able to do at a fairly low cost. The olive harvest that year was especially good, and there was great demand for olive presses. Therefore, Thales was able to make a huge profit by renting the machines back to their owners, on his own terms. Having made his point (and his money), Thales returned to philosophizing.

Aristotle argues that Thales’s knowledge was what made this possible—that he studied the stars and learned through astrology that the harvest would be a bountiful one. **However, the truth is the exact opposite; it didn’t matter how good the harvest was, because Thales was practicing optionality.**

With a relatively small investment, he gained temporary control of every olive press in the area. If the harvest that year had been poor, he could have simply held onto the presses and wouldn’t have been out too much money. Since the harvest happened to be excellent, he sold the rights back and made a tidy return on his small investment. **In short, Thales had _options_, and because of that, the randomness of the harvest worked in his favor.**

This is one example—possibly the oldest one recorded—of optionality leading to antifragility.

### Options Maximize Upsides and Minimize Downsides

Remember that the basic pattern of antifragility is to have more upside available than downside—that being the case, on average you’ll gain more than you lose from random changes. **The best way to make sure that happens is to have options available to you, so you can make the best choice at any given time.**

This principle applies even in very mundane situations. For example, someone invited to a dinner party that isn’t especially interesting, but is better than eating alone, might call around first to see if any other friends are available that evening. If a more interesting opportunity presents itself, the person can skip the party and do that instead. If not, the party is available as a fallback option, with the key word being _option_. This person has very little to lose—at worst, he winds up at a party that’s rather less exciting than he’d hoped. At best, he finds something more fun to do and has an excellent evening.

Another person who benefits from optionality is any tenant in a rent-controlled apartment. This person can stay in the apartment for as long as he wants, largely protected from inflation. On the other hand, if rents in town somehow drop—or if the tenant suddenly decides to start a new life in Mongolia, or what have you—leaving the place is a fairly easy matter. All he has to do is notify the landlord a given number of days in advance and start packing.

**The key in both scenarios is that the person in question has the option—but not the obligation—to stay in his current situation.** There’s no risk that things will get worse, and if he happens to find better offers elsewhere, he’s able to take them. Also in both situations, there’s minimal cost for the options. The person looking for a fun evening is only out the time and effort of calling some friends, while the tenant only needs to keep paying the same rent he always has. Therefore, in both cases, there is a significant chance for improvement with little risk or cost.

#### Options Love Dispersion

Because of the high chance of benefits and limited downsides, options love dispersion—that is, they like being distributed across a large number of possibilities and outcomes. **The negative outcomes don’t matter nearly as much as the positive ones, because when you have options available you simply don’t choose the negative outcomes.**

This is another reason why things like art and ideas are antifragile: There’s no downside to people not liking them. People who hate a certain book can’t give the author negative sales, and people who find an idea distasteful can’t rip it from the heads of other people. For artists and authors, therefore, it’s actually better to have a small but devoted following, regardless of how many haters their work also attracts.

Having people’s opinions distributed in this way, from total contempt to adoration, is a net benefit for the artist. The worst possible thing for such people is to have everyone find their work acceptable, or “just okay,” because people don’t tend to buy things that are just okay.

It’s likely that dispersion is also how society will make progress. **Societal improvements won’t happen by raising the average intelligence or education level of the population; they’ll occur because a few rare people have the imagination and courage to make that progress happen.** Their outcomes will be distributed from utter failure to resounding success, and this is the key: The failures will not harm society at large, while the successes will benefit it.

### Rationality, Not Intelligence

Making proper use of options doesn’t take any great intellect. Remember Thales and his rented olive presses: He didn’t have any brilliant insight or foreknowledge about the olive harvest, he simply had the options available to take advantage of the opportunity when it arose. Similarly, Fat Tony didn’t come out on top of the market crash because he was a scholar or some great thinker—he was quite the opposite—he simply set up his investments with an eye toward minimizing losses while he waited for the right moment to seize his profits.

Nature itself uses optionality to always find the best outcomes—or at least, the outcomes that will allow life to continue. Countless mutations and evolutionary trends fail, and the organisms carrying them die out. However, these failures don’t harm nature itself. At the same time, the beneficial mutations and trends propagate, making it ever-more-likely that life will continue to exist on Earth. You wouldn’t call nature intelligent, but there’s no arguing that it’s rational.

**The point is this: Rationality is simply the ability to choose the best option at any given time, and that’s all that’s needed for antifragility.** You don’t need to be smart or learned, you simply need to know what your options are and which ones will benefit you.

#### Education Can Blind You

In fact, in many ways it seems like intelligence and education are uniquely _un_suited to recognizing and choosing options. The trouble is that scientists and scholars look for things that are exciting and newsworthy, things that will get their names printed in important journals and awards hung around their necks. However, when it comes to rational, practical discoveries—and, even more so, applications—these highly intelligent people often miss what’s staring them in the face.

For example, consider the invention of the wheeled suitcase. It’s an incredibly simple application of an incredibly simple tool. Wheels have existed for thousands of years, and suitcases for hundreds. However, it wasn’t until decades after we put people on the moon that wheeled suitcases became common. Furthermore, comparing wheeled suitcases to the moon landing, the suitcases have a much more immediate and obvious impact on the average person’s life.

The point is this: For all of humans’ vaunted intelligence and imagination, we’re often incredibly shortsighted and stupid. The obvious only becomes obvious in hindsight, like putting wheels on heavy suitcases. Until then, it’s a matter of random chance that drives invention and discovery. Who can say what random event sparked the insight that led a luggage maker—not some NASA genius—to put wheels on his creations?

The role of randomness naturally means that, once again, antifragility is preferable to intelligence. This is why having many options, and the rationality to see their potential, is so much rarer and more important than traditional intelligence and book learning.

#### The Long Shot Is Worth It

Related to the intelligence versus rationality point is the idea of the long shot. Many intelligent people will point out that lotteries and casinos—which offer very small chances of very large payouts—aren’t worth it. And they’re correct; the options that you get from lotteries and casinos are too expensive, giving you ever-increasing downsides that are unlikely to ever be offset by your winnings.

Where these intelligent-but-irrational people go wrong is in applying the same logic to _any_ kind of long shot. For example, it’s extremely unlikely that buying stock in any given company will make you rich. However, if you invest a few dollars each in a lot of different companies—including, say, Amazon or Apple when they were first starting out—you’ll have limited cost with the potential for immense profits.

Therefore, it’s better to keep your options open (like Thales renting the olive presses) rather than try to pinpoint the most profitable company through superior knowledge and reason, as Aristotle might have done. By limiting your costs and maximizing your chance to profit, you can be all but certain that at least one of these so-called long shots will pay off.

### Errors Are Investments

With all this talk of options and chance, one could be excused for thinking that the world progresses almost completely randomly. However, that’s not the case. **Whether you’re looking at evolution, politics, or scientific discovery, the world progresses through trial and error.**

While it can look a lot like pure randomness, trial and error must be guided by rationality. For a mundane example, if you’ve misplaced your wallet, finding it is a matter of trial and error. You start with where it’s most likely to be, and work your way through ever-less-likely locations until you find it. You also don’t tend to look in the same place multiple times, which could easily happen if your search pattern were completely random.

The treasure hunter Greg Stemm used a more codified version of the same strategy to make his finds, including the sunken Spanish frigate _Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes_, which was carrying cargo worth a billion dollars in today’s money. Stemm would start by outlining the area where his target could possibly be, and break it down into smaller chunks by how likely he thought it was that the ship would be there. He’d start with the most likely spot, and search each of those subsections extremely thoroughly, only moving on when he was completely certain the ship wasn’t there.

**In both situations, the key point is that every error yields useful information.** While Stemm might have spent weeks searching a particular area and coming up (seemingly) empty, he would then know that the treasure _isn’t_ in that spot. With that information, every subsequent place he checked had a greater and greater chance of paying off. The time and money he spent searching those places wasn’t lost, it was invested.

Searching for a lost item is an easy way to illustrate this concept, but it applies to practically all forms of discovery and invention. Everything that doesn’t work gets you closer to figuring out what does. **The key to making it work is, as we’ve discussed, minimizing your costs and downsides while maximizing your profits and upsides.**

### Epiphenomena: Confusing Cause and Effect

Another common mistake that intelligent people make is falling victim to _epiphenomena_—the incorrect belief that one thing causes another. **In other words, confusing correlation for causation.** For example, if you knew nothing about ships, you might come to the conclusion that the ship’s compass is directing it rather than simply telling which direction it’s going.

One epiphenomenon that pervades modern life is the belief that greed causes economic crises. Intelligent people note that economic depressions and extreme wealth inequality are often seen together, and they conclude that people hoarding money is the reason for the depression. This leads to the conclusion that greed is a new problem, and that if we could eliminate it, then our economies would be stable.

**However, greed goes much further back in history than our current fragile economic systems.** We see greed mentioned in texts from more than two millennia ago: The ancient Roman poet Virgil talked about _greed of gold_, and the Latin version of the New Testament warns that greed is the root of evil—_radix malorum est cupiditas._

In all the time since, nobody’s found the cure for human greed. The much simpler and more practical approach is to build systems that won’t be destroyed by it. **Remember that one major cause of fragility in a system is size; our economic systems today are gargantuan, complex systems that are terribly fragile as a result.**

#### Separating Correlation From Causation

The simplest way to debunk epiphenomena is to look at sequences of events, and check whether one always comes before the other. If so, you still can’t positively conclude that one causes the other—however, if the pattern doesn’t hold, you can prove that one _doesn’t_ cause the other.

**One place to look carefully for such patterns is in academia—and specifically when academic theories are used to run the real world.** There’s an old joke about a Harvard professor who lectured birds about how to fly, and he was convinced that his brilliant teaching was why they were so good at it. That’s clearly ridiculous, but people often credit scientists and mathematicians for systems that worked perfectly well without them.

For example, the mathematician Michael Atiyah, best known for his work on string theory, once came to New York on a fundraising mission. He made a speech listing numerous ways that math had been usefully applied to the real world, such as in traffic signals. Notably absent from his speech, however, were times when mathematics had caused immense harm, such as grim economic forecasts leading to self-fulfilling panics.

A side note: The kind of cherry-picking that Atiyah used in his speech is yet another example of options leading to antifragility. The one doing the picking gets to choose which facts to include and which to leave out. The wider the spread of facts is—in other words, the more options there are—the better (or worse) the cherry-picker can make the situation look. The cherry-picker’s story becomes stronger thanks to the randomness of the information he can choose from.
