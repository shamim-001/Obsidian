## 1-Page Summary

In _The 50th Law,_ rapper 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) and author Robert Greene argue that the biggest factor holding us back in life is _fear_—of what others think of us, what we’ll lose, the future, and so on. This natural fearfulness developed to help us survive in ancient times, but in modern times, we rarely face life-threatening situations where it’s warranted. As a result, our fearfulness only holds us back from gaining power and achieving success.

Jackson and Greene argue that you must become _fearless_ to truly thrive. They illustrate this point by telling the story of Jackson’s struggles and accomplishments on his way to success and presenting the rules of fearlessness that he followed to get there.

Jackson is an American Rapper from Southside Queens, New York. He released his first major-label album, _[Get Rich or Die Tryin’](https://www.shadyrecords.com/album/get-rich-or-die-tryin/)_, in 2003, and in 2005, he starred in a [film of the same name](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430308/) detailing his rise to fame. Jackson has sold over 30 million albums and received numerous awards, including a Grammy and multiple Billboard Music Awards. He’s also branched out into numerous other industries, including acting, talent management, apparel, liquor, and book publishing.

Greene is a best-selling author who’s arguably best-known for _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power),_ his guide to power dynamics and social dominance. He’s also the author of _[Mastery](https://shortform.com/app/book/mastery/1-page-summary), [The 33 Strategies of War](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-33-strategies-of-war),_ and _[The Art of Seduction](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-seduction)._

In this guide, we’ll start by exploring Jackson’s life story and how his fearlessness helped him overcome hardship and achieve power and success. Next, we’ll discuss the rules that Jackson and Greene say are necessary to follow to become fearless and principles that’ll help you follow each one. In our commentary, we’ll supplement Jackson and Greene’s advice with recommendations from other experts on success, like Daniel Walter (_[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline)_). We’ll also compare the ideas in this book to those in some of Greene’s previous works, including _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)._

### The Life of Curtis Jackson

The authors write that **Jackson had a difficult childhood.** He was raised in Southside Queens (New York City, New York) during the height of the crack cocaine epidemic with little familial guidance and almost no opportunity for upward mobility. Hustling by dealing drugs (which we’ll refer to simply as “hustling”) was the only career that could provide Jackon with enough income to live comfortably, so he chose to pursue this path at a young age. Hustling was a dangerous lifestyle, and Jackson faced violence from other hustlers, drug addicts, and police**.**

(Shortform note: Jackson wasn’t the only one who struggled with life in New York during the crack epidemic—[a 1989 New York Times article explains that the effects were felt city-wide](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/20/nyregion/after-3-years-crack-plague-in-new-york-only-gets-worse.html). From 1987 to 1988, the homicide rate in the city jumped by 10.4%, with 38% of those homicides involving drugs (including crack). Crack use also tripled the cases of child neglect by intoxicated parents. Further, crack became most popular in disadvantaged Black and Hispanic neighborhoods (like Jackson’s) because, as Jackson suggests, it promised increased social or economic status—new dealers joined the industry for quick economic gains, and the poor used the drug to feel part of wider society.)

**To survive in these treacherous conditions, Jackson adopted what he and Greene call the “50th Law”**: Instead of fearing circumstances he couldn’t control, he adopted a fearless mindset. He took advantage of opportunities, adapted when necessary, forged his own path, and followed that path fervidly and without delay.

(Shortform note: While Jackson and Greene present the “50th Law” as a new rule for success that they’ve co-created, it actually encompasses some of Greene’s existing rules from _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)_. For example, [Greene’s 28th Law in The 48 Laws is to act boldly](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power/law-28)—be confident, forge your own path, follow it without delay, and _don’t_ let fear and hesitation hold you back. Further, [Greene’s 25th Law is to reinvent yourself](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power/law-25)—adapt your actions and image according to your circumstances to control how others see you and maintain power. That said, Greene’s _48 Laws_ isn’t as supportive of taking advantage of _all_ opportunities, as recommended in _The 50th Law._ Instead, Greene argues [you should be tactical and focus your efforts](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power/law-23) on actions from which you’ll benefit the most.)

In the following sections, we’ll discuss two distinct periods of Jackson’s life in which his fearlessness helped him achieve major success: when he transitioned from a hustler to a rapper, and when he became an independent artist.

#### Fearlessness Transformed Jackson From a Queens Hustler Into a Rap Star

The authors write that Jackson’s fearlessness when pursuing hustling quickly paid off. He became one of the most successful hustlers in his area, gaining respect from customers and other hustlers alike. However, Jackson soon realized that with his newfound fearlessness, he could accomplish more than being a great hustler. **He decided to leave his home and hustling career to chase his dream of becoming a rapper.**

Once again, despite having no connections or experience in the music industry, **Jackson used his fearlessness to make his dream of becoming a rapper** **into reality**. In a few short years, he was signed to Columbia Records and ready to release his first album. However, right before the album’s release, Jackson was shot multiple times by an assassin sent by an old hustling competitor. As a result, his record label dropped him and he was back at square one.

This didn’t stop Jackson, however. He maintained his fearlessness and used his unfortunate circumstances to change the rap world forever. Once he recovered from his injuries, he created a unique genre of rap based on his dangerous experiences that portrayed the harsh reality of life on the inner-city streets. He spread the word about his music by handing out free mixtapes on the streets of New York. Jackson soon gained the attention of Eminem and joined his and Dr. Dre’s label.

> **Violence and “Gangsta Rap” in the Hip-Hop Industry**
> 
> Jackson isn’t the only hip-hop artist who both had a rough childhood _and_ experienced gun violence after entering the industry—in fact, [it's a fairly common occurrence](https://medium.com/music-culture-irl/the-correlation-between-rap-and-violence-5302c491af02). A 2015 article shows that murder was the cause of more than 50% of all hip-hop artists’ deaths, including internationally renowned artists such as Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G. (Biggie Smalls), Pop Smoke, and Takeoff.
> 
> Experts have differing views on why hip-hop artists face such violence in the industry. Some argue that it’s the result of [the cultural prevalence of guns in America, not hip-hop culture](https://theconversation.com/rappers-are-victims-of-an-epidemic-of-gun-violence-just-like-all-of-america-194429). Others argue that [it’s due to gang prevalence in the industry and the dangerous inner-city conditions many hip-hop artists, like Jackson, grew up in](https://medium.com/music-culture-irl/the-correlation-between-rap-and-violence-5302c491af02).
> 
> Still others argue that the specific genre of rap Jackson helped give rise to—what many call “gangsta rap”—is the cause of violence inside and outside of the industry. For instance, an article featured in a 1995 publication from the US Department of Health and Human Services claims that [gangsta rap promotes violence in Black communities](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/gangsta-rap-promotes-violence-black-community-violence-media-p-159)—arguably among rappers and civilians alike. Critics of the view that rap promotes violence in Black communities point out that many rap musicians [use their art form to criticize gun violence and condemn the structural issues, like racism, that marginalize Black communities](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/where-rap-meets-race/article/2018/4/4/whererapmeetsrace-installment4/).

#### Fearlessness Transformed Jackson From a Rap Star Into a Global Figure and Entrepreneur

**While working in the music industry, Jackson used his fearlessness to maintain his autonomy and success.** Rather than letting the record label control and use him until his popularity slowly dwindled, he took control of his music and image, seeking independence from the label. As a result, he’s survived and thrived for years in the music industry and now owns a business empire of his own.

(Shortform note: [More and more modern artists are breaking free of record label control as Jackson did](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60051802). This is arguably due to the social media app TikTok—rather than music being provided to consumers from the top down (record labels deciding which artists to sign and promote), consumers can more easily discover new music through the app and request more of what _they_ want to hear. This gives independent artists more exposure than previously. Further, experts explain that going independent is appealing because, while difficult, it’s much more rewarding than staying with a label because artists don’t have to conform to industry standards. They also receive a much larger chunk of their royalties.)

**Jackson’s dedication to fearlessness is the recipe for his success**. Jackson and Greene elaborate that to live fearlessly, you must commit yourself to _10 principles,_ which we’ve synthesized into six rules. We’ll discuss each of these rules and how to follow them in the following sections.

### Rule #1: Gain Acute Awareness of Reality

First, Jackson and Greene argue that **to achieve fearlessness, you must become acutely aware of the reality of your circumstances,** no matter how painful they are.

Many people struggle to follow this rule because they want to avoid the anxiety and fear that arises when thinking of unpleasant facts. Consequently, they avoid confronting the harsh reality of their circumstances. As a result, these people have an inaccurate or incomplete view of reality that leaves them powerless to make the changes they desire in life.

On the other hand, **becoming acutely aware of the factors shaping your circumstances allows you to achieve ultimate power over them**. Gaining acute awareness requires you to look at the internal and external factors that have shaped your circumstances—your mindset and fears—as well as external elements like the people around you. Once you understand how these factors are shaping your reality, you can identify opportunities to manipulate them and change your future.

> **Don’t Just Gain Awareness—Take Responsibility, Too**
> 
> In _[The 10X Rule](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule),_ Grant Cardone argues that the key to achieving success is not only to become aware of your circumstances (as Greene and Jackson recommend) but also to take _full responsibility_ for them. He explains that many people are aware of the factors shaping their circumstances but are unable to change because [they have a victim mindset](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/chapter-6)—they believe that their bad luck is always the result of external factors that they can’t control.
> 
> In many ways, this mentality is _also_ rooted in the fear of reality: People with victim mindsets may fear confronting their own role in their troubles and, by extension, their flaws. However, the only way to escape this mindset and change is to take responsibility for your life and choices. To do this, identify how your own actions have shaped your situation and decide what you can do differently to avoid similar situations in the future.

Jackson and Greene present five principles to help you gain acute awareness and make the best of your circumstances.

#### Principle #1: Be Opportunistic

Jackson and Greene argue that **events aren’t objectively good or bad—_they are what you make of them_**. A seemingly negative event could become a positive turning point in your life if you’re opportunistic and take advantage of the circumstances. For example, if someone is spreading rumors about you at work, you could use the attention to show everyone in the office how upstanding you are. In the end, you’ll gain the respect of everyone in the office _and_ get a promotion from your boss.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power),_ Rhonda Byrne agrees that [situations are what we make of them](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power/chapter-9#be-mindful-of-how-you-label-life). She elaborates that when we interpret an event negatively, we emit a negative frequency into the universe that attracts more negativity back to us. If we’re _opportunistic_ and interpret the event positively (by looking for a way it can benefit us), [we’ll emit a positive frequency that will attract more positivity back to us](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power#the-power-of-love). If you’re regularly interpreting situations negatively, Byrne argues that it’s because you lack love in your heart. In this situation, seek out ways to change your mindset by doing things that evoke positivity, like spending time with loved ones.)

#### Principle #2: Maintain Your Curiosity

The authors note that one of the biggest issues preventing us from seeing the reality of a situation is believing we already know everything about it. If you naturally assume that you _don’t_ know everything and stay curious, **you’ll be guaranteed to discover more than you would have otherwise**.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline),_ Daniel Walter explains that the belief that we know everything is linked to a common cognitive bias called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which [is our tendency to overestimate our abilities (or knowledge) when we lack expertise in an area](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline#tendency-2-over-estimating-personal-abilities). This stunts our growth as we falsely believe that we’re already competent, so there’s no need to try to improve. To avoid this bias—and, in turn, maintain your curiosity and desire to learn—Walter recommends seeking feedback from others who can give you a realistic perspective on your strengths and weaknesses.)

#### Principle #3: Become Aware of All the Factors and Perspectives Surrounding a Situation

According to the authors, if you’re only seeing something from your perspective, you’re likely to miss things—so, **consider how others might view the situation, and look for any hidden factors contributing to it**. Not only will you gain a better understanding of why things are the way they are, but you’ll also be able to anticipate how shifts in certain factors could alter the circumstances. With this foresight, you can take advantage of these factors and change them to get what you want before others even notice what’s happening.

(Shortform note: While Jackson and Greene recommend trying to see all the factors and perspectives involved in a situation, they don’t provide much advice on how to _cultivate_ the ability to do so. [Experts explain that watching TV shows, watching movies, and reading fiction are all great ways to develop this skill](https://psychologycompass.com/blog/point-of-view/#:~:text=Tip%201%3A%20Watch%20a%20movie%20or%20TV%20show). Observing how and why fictional characters think and feel in certain ways will give you better insight into how different people might think and feel in the real world. Further, analyzing all the factors that contribute to fictional situations, such as the downfall of a fictional business empire, can arguably improve your awareness of possibly hidden factors impacting your real-life circumstances.)

#### Principle #4: Look for the Root of the Problem

If you’ve followed Principle #3, you’ll have a firm grasp of all the factors contributing to a circumstance. However, Jackson and Greene argue that this awareness isn’t enough—all of these factors are usually connected to one underlying factor that’s the root cause of the situation. **Knowing the root cause will give you more power to change your circumstances and a heightened ability to anticipate changes.**

> **Use the ‘Five Whys’ to Get to the Root of the Problem**
> 
> In _[Principles: Life and Work](https://shortform.com/app/book/principles-life-and-work),_ Ray Dalio recommends using the “five whys” technique to identify the root cause of a problem. [This process involves progressively uncovering why each unfortunate event that ultimately led to the overall issue occurred](https://shortform.com/app/book/principles-life-and-work/part-3#ask-probing-questions). To use this technique, first, ask yourself _why_ things didn't go as planned. Then, ask yourself _why_ your answer occurred, and repeat the process three more times.
> 
> For example, your overarching issue is that you were penalized for being late to work. First, ask _why_ you were late to work—because you slept through your alarm. Second, ask _why_ you slept through your alarm—because you went to sleep late last night. Third, ask _why_ you went to sleep late—because you didn’t finish your work during your regular hours. Fourth, ask _why_ you didn’t finish your work—because your boss piled on extra work at the last minute without adjusting your deadline. Fifth, ask _why_ your boss piled on work without adjusting your deadline—probably because she didn’t realize how much work you already had on your plate.
> 
> Ultimately, the root of this issue is your boss having unrealistic expectations of you because she isn’t aware of your day-to-day workload and schedule.

#### Principle #5: Judge People by Their Actions Instead of Their Words

According to Jackson and Greene, what people say doesn’t always align with their underlying motives. This can be problematic if someone intends to act against your best interests but manipulates you to think they’ll do otherwise. To gain the most realistic idea of who a person is and what they truly want, **focus on their actions and who they really are, rather than on their words and who they want you to _think_ they are.**

(Shortform note: Jackson and Greene suggest that you should judge people based on their behaviors because actions speak louder than words. However, people’s actions might not always accurately reflect their beliefs and desires. Experts explain that people often act against who they truly are, what they truly think, or what they truly want [due to underlying issues like internal conflict and past trauma](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/peaceful-parenting/201906/why-we-behave-in-ways-we-dont-cant-seem-change). If someone starts acting in a way that you wouldn’t expect, a compassionate response might be to check in with them and see if they’re okay rather than making an immediate character judgment.)

### Rule #2: Be Self-Sufficient

Second, Jackson and Greene argue that **fearlessness involves being self-sufficient.** This means surviving and thriving completely on your own without relying on others to provide you with comfort or support, whether financially, emotionally, or physically.

**Many people struggle to follow this rule because we’re raised to be dependent on others from childhood**. We’re dependent on our parents for everything while growing up, on bosses for employment and financial stability, and on friends for mental and emotional support. However, this reliance gives others power over you and takes away your autonomy. This limits your power to grow, succeed, and change your circumstances—you can’t reach your full potential if you’re relying on others to provide for you.

(Shortform note: While Jackson and Greene argue that you should gain full self-sufficiency rather than relying on others for support, some experts argue that [relying on social support systems is integral to reaching your goals and sustaining your mental health and well-being](https://www.verywellmind.com/social-support-for-psychological-health-4119970). People who rely on strong social support systems are better at coping with stress, have increased motivation to achieve their goals, and are more likely to engage in healthy and productive behaviors. On the other hand, people who don’t lean on their support system in difficult times have an increased risk of alcohol use, cardiovascular disease, depression, and suicide.)

Jackson and Greene present three principles to help you become self-sufficient.

#### Principle #1: Learn From Your Superiors

Anyone that you’re reliant on—your boss, for example—provides you with something that you can’t yet provide for yourself. According to Jackson and Greene, **the first step in becoming self-sufficient is watching these people and learning from them**. For example, how does the supervisor you rely on for advice make such good decisions on her own?

(Shortform note: While Jackson and Greene recommend paying close attention to your superiors to learn from them, they don’t get specific on exactly _how_ to do so. [Experts provide a few recommendations that may increase the amount you learn from your superiors](http://careertipster.com/careerdev/learning-from-your-superiors/). First, ask to shadow your superior to get a closer perspective on their skills and day-to-day activities. Further, each day, pay close attention to your superior’s mistakes—so you can learn from them—_and_ the factors that lead to their success—so you can emulate them.)

#### Principle #2: Start Small

The authors say that once you have an idea of how to manage things on your own, **start carving out small pockets of autonomy where you can practice self-sufficiency**. For example, use the methods you learned from your supervisor to start making important decisions independently, without having to ask others for approval.

(Shortform note: In _[Tiny Habits](https://shortform.com/app/book/tiny-habits),_ BJ Fogg reiterates that [starting small is crucial to successfully implementing any new habit or behavior](https://shortform.com/app/book/tiny-habits/introduction), including self-sufficiency. He also explains _why_ this is the case: First, small habits and tasks are easier to accomplish. Accomplishing a task triggers positive emotions that will motivate you to continue working toward your larger goal. Further, tiny habits are simple and don’t require a large amount of willpower or focus, making them easier to start in the first place.)

#### Principle #3: Be Entirely Authentic

In the process of becoming self-sufficient, be sure to remain true to who _you_ are, not who others are or who they want you to be. **Ensure that your decisions and actions align with your goals and principles**. Jackson and Greene argue that everyone is unique, and being authentic will help you become someone or create something the world has never seen before. You’ll reach your full potential, and this will lead to success.

(Shortform note: Jackson and Greene frame being authentic as something to do to ensure your _success_. However, authenticity arguably has a much more important benefit: It boosts your self-worth. In _[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection),_ Brené Brown explains that [authenticity is a crucial component of worthiness](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/part-2#be-authentic): having high self-esteem and feeling deserving of good things. Worthiness may, in turn, have the happy side-effect of success: Without it, you might not have the self-belief necessary to accomplish your goals. We’ll discuss the link between self-belief and fearlessness in more detail in Rule #5: Become an Inspiring Leader.)

### Rule #3: Embrace Change and Maintain Forward Motion

Third, Jackson and Greene argue that **to achieve fearlessness, maintain forward motion by being open to change and learning new things**. When moving toward a goal, unexpected situations will always arise. The only way to overcome these situations and maintain forward motion is to learn, adapt, and stay committed to your goal. If you resist change, try to accomplish your goals the “quick” way, or avoid learning everything you can about your craft, you’ll only end up slowing yourself down.

Many people struggle to maintain consistent forward motion for two reasons. **First, they have set beliefs about how things are supposed to be.** When a situation arises that they didn’t expect, they get flustered and don’t know how to react, slowing down their progress. However, if you embrace unexpected situations and adapt to handle them, not only will you maintain your momentum toward your goal, but you’ll also add skills to your repertoire and achieve success faster than those who resist change.

(Shortform note: Experts note that people tend to set expectations to maintain control and avoid uncertainty, and these experts reiterate that it’s natural to get stumped when things don’t go as planned. However, they add that [we can avoid becoming overwhelmed in the face of unexpected events by implementing a few strategies](https://www.verywellmind.com/coping-when-things-dont-go-as-planned-6833036). For example, try to be flexible when things don’t go as planned. Consider whether you can accommodate or cope with the change and how it might benefit you—even if it’s not what you originally wanted. Alternatively, if the change is distressing and you feel unable to cope, seek support from loved ones or a therapist.)

**Second, people struggle to maintain momentum because they want fast results and look for shortcuts that don’t exist.** Jackson and Greene argue that to reach your goals and _maintain_ your success, you must become a true expert in your discipline. There’s no fast way to do this: You must dedicate time and effort to your goals to succeed, and taking shortcuts will only sabotage you in the end.

(Shortform note: Jackson and Greene argue that there are no shortcuts to gaining expertise—you need to dedicate time and effort to achieve true success in your desired discipline. However, they don’t specify _how much_ time and effort this requires. Some experts claim that [it takes at least 10 years to achieve expertise in a discipline](https://www.zenbusiness.com/blog/expert/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20Going%20to,under%20HBR%E2%80%99s%20definition.). Further, you must spend this time engaging in _deliberate practice_ to actually progress toward expertise. Deliberate practice requires you to _regularly_ do things that are above your current level of competence and push yourself outside of your comfort zone—we’ll discuss this concept further a little later.)

Jackson and Greene present five principles to help you embrace change and learning to maintain forward motion:

#### Principle #1: Accumulate a Wide Range of Knowledge

**Rather than only focusing on your main area of interest, constantly learn about new topics and fields of knowledge.** According to Jackson and Greene, this will help you change directions if unexpected situations arise. For example, imagine that you’ve bought a house to renovate and resell, but the housing market just crashed. In most cases, you’d consider yourself doomed. However, with a broad range of knowledge, you might know that the art scene is booming right now, so you could convert the house into an art studio for people to rent.

(Shortform note: In _[Building a Second Brain](https://shortform.com/app/book/building-a-second-brain),_ Tiago Forte agrees that accumulating a wide range of knowledge is integral to success in the modern age. However, he explains that [our brains aren’t equipped to store all of the important knowledge we need](https://shortform.com/app/book/building-a-second-brain/1-page-summary#your-brains-not-equipped-to-effectively-manage-todays-information). He recommends [creating a digital, external storage system](https://shortform.com/app/book/building-a-second-brain/1-page-summary#how-will-an-ess-increase-performance) that makes it easy to store and recall every important piece of information you encounter.)

#### Principle #2: Don’t Hold On to Negative Emotions

People tend to wallow in negative emotions. However, this makes the bad feelings stick around for longer and eventually decreases your motivation and momentum. Instead, Jackson and Greene say to **let negative emotions wash over you, and find a way to evoke the opposite emotion instead**. For example, if you’re feeling anxious, force yourself to act confidently. If you’re feeling lonely, call someone that makes you feel loved.

(Shortform note: Experts agree not to dwell on negative emotions. However, quickly replacing your emotion and moving on, as Jackson and Greene recommend, might cause you to _ignore_ your emotions entirely and make the situation worse: Unaddressed emotions may recur until you address them. To avoid this outcome, [some experts advise analyzing your emotions using the “Siberian North Rail Road” (SBNRR) technique](https://siyli.org/mindfulness-and-negative-emotions/). First, _Stop_: Pause what you’re doing before you spiral. Second, _Breathe_: This will clear your mind. Third, _Notice_ your feelings: What emotions are you experiencing? Are they changing? Fourth, _Reflect_: What’s causing your emotions? Are they an appropriate response to what’s happened? Fifth, _Respond_: Think of the kindest, most compassionate response to yourself and anyone else involved.)

#### Principle #3: Focus on the Small Details Over the Big Picture

To further ensure consistent forward momentum, Jackson and Greene recommend **focusing on the small elements that success requires—skills, knowledge, completed tasks, and so on**—rather than overlooking them and solely focusing on your end goal. Focusing on the big picture _might_ allow you to achieve your goal, but your success will likely be short-lived as you don’t have the skills and knowledge to sustain yourself.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline)_, Daniel Walter reiterates the importance of focusing on small details [like daily tasks and subgoals that are necessary to success](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/1-page-summary#habit-2-create-plans-to-achieve-your-goals). He adds that focusing on a big lofty goal without identifying the stepping stones needed to achieve it can often lead to inaction. To help identify these crucial smaller details, Walter advises creating very clear, specific goals—this makes it easier to identify the smaller steps you must take to achieve them. Then, identify how you can break these smaller steps down into even smaller daily actions so that every day, you’re making progress toward your goal.)

#### Principle #4: Start Doing Things and Embracing Failure

Jackson and Greene argue that **you must try new things and fail along the way to make true progress toward your goals.** Many people struggle to do this because they fear failure. However, becoming successful requires you to master new skills that your current self _isn’t_ yet a master at—if you avoid practicing these skills because you fear failure, you’ll never make progress. Jackson and Greene note that the more you try and fail, the more you learn and the faster you improve.

(Shortform note: In _[The Power of Discipline](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline)_, Daniel Walter agrees that forcing yourself to take action and step outside of your comfort zone is crucial to achieving your goals. However, doing so can be extremely hard if you’re not used to the feeling of being uncomfortable. To increase your confidence and ability to step outside of your comfort zone, [Walter recommends putting yourself in uncomfortable situations on a daily basis](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-discipline/1-page-summary#habit-4-become-familiar-with-discomfort)—you don’t necessarily have to do something big and risky, just something small that familiarizes you with feeling uncomfortable. For example, if you have a fear of public speaking, ask your friends if you can read a poem for them.)

#### Principle #5: Pay Attention to and Accept Social Change

Finally, to maintain forward motion, you must be open to change—Jackson and Greene argue that this means **keeping tabs on social change so you can adjust yourself to meet the wants and needs of the people**. Many powerful players fail at maintaining success because they do the opposite—they try to convince stakeholders like customers or supporters that their idea is still valuable or important. This is often ineffective because you can’t always convince people that your perspective is sound. However, if you simply mirror what people want, you won’t ever have to convince them to support you: They _naturally_ will.

(Shortform note: In _[Rework](https://shortform.com/app/book/rework),_ Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson take a different perspective on balancing stakeholder wants and needs with your ideas. Instead of monitoring the public’s views so you can change your ideas to meet their needs as Jackson and Greene recommend, Fried and Hansson argue that [you should create timeless concepts from the start](https://shortform.com/app/book/rework/chapter-4#principle-7-make-your-business-timeless). In doing so, your business idea will never go out of style: You won't have to waste time and energy trying to predict trends and constantly changing your concepts.)

### Rule #4: Show Your Teeth When Necessary

Fourth, Jackson and Greene argue that **to be fearless, you must show your teeth—be aggressive when aggression is needed.** Otherwise, people will underestimate or take advantage of you.

Many people struggle to follow this rule because they want to be liked and accepted by others, so they’re passive and avoid confrontation. However, Jackson and Greene believe that confrontation is crucial to progressing toward any goal. If you don’t confront your competition and people who are sabotaging you, you’ll never gain power and success—there’ll always be someone or something holding you back.

(Shortform note: Greene first explored the concept of using aggression to gain power in _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)._ While Greene and Jackson heavily emphasize being fiercely and dramatically aggressive in _The 50th Law_, in _48 Laws_, Greene discusses a crucial caveat to this rule: [If you rely too heavily on aggression, you’ll likely end up weakening rather than strengthening your power](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power/law-8#principles) by tiring yourself out and creating numerous enemies on all fronts. To avoid this outcome, keep your emotions (and aggression) contained while luring your enemy to attack first. You’ll reserve your energy while they deplete theirs, and you won’t create unnecessary enemies.)

Jackson and Greene present three principles to help you confront problematic, aggressive situations.

#### Principle #1: Respond to Outward Aggression by Acting Cool

**If someone is being outwardly aggressive, act cool.** Don’t return outward aggression with outward aggression of your own—you might overcome your competition, but you’ll look just as bad as them in the process. Instead, remain calm and plant obstacles in the other person’s way that will increase their aggression. Then, you can either expose their aggression to the public or wait until they sabotage themselves.

(Shortform note: While Jackon and Greene’s recommendation might be an effective tactic to _gain power_ over the other person, [it can arguably cause more harm than good](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201510/9-keys-to-handling-hostile-and-confrontational-people). First, psychologists explicitly warn _not_ to escalate difficult situations (for example, by planting obstacles that will increase the other person’s anger) because the other person might lash out and harm you or others. Further, while causing an aggressive person to self-destruct might benefit _you,_ it arguably lacks compassion. It could also mentally and emotionally devastate someone who has uncontrollable, underlying issues: Issues such as pathological anger, PTSD, brain trauma, and life crises often trigger aggression.)

#### Principle #2: Respond to Passive Aggression by Increasing Your Power

**If someone is passive-aggressive, increase your power over them to scare them away.** The best way to do this, according to Jackson and Greene, is to make powerful allies that this person respects or fears. If they see you as an authority (or adjacent to an authority), they’ll be less likely to try and mess with you. In contrast, if you try to confront this person, they’ll likely gaslight you into thinking you’ve invented or created the problem yourself.

(Shortform note: While Jackson and Greene recommend responding to passive aggressors by increasing your power over them, they don’t provide specific advice on how to identify passive-aggressive behavior in the first place. Experts explain that someone might be a passive aggressor when they do things like [intentionally leave you out in social situations, behave as if something minor harmed them greatly, or purposefully bring up topics they know upset you](https://psychcentral.com/relationships/how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-person#examples:~:text=12%20examples%20of%20passive%2Daggressive%20behaviors).)

#### Principle #3: Respond to Injustice With Bold Aggression or Undercover Manipulation

**If someone is acting unjustly toward you, either act with bold aggression or undercover manipulation.** According to Jackson and Greene, acting with bold aggression will make you look like the righteous party to many, but it’s also likely to attract haters. If you want to be viewed as universally just, you’ll have to be manipulative in turning the tides—say whatever you must to gain supporters, and engineer situations that will expose the opposing party’s injustice.

(Shortform note: Psychologists warn that retaliating against perceived ''unfairness” (by doing things like acting aggressively or being manipulative) [might have negative repercussions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/wander-woman/201108/how-deal-unfairness). They suggest that before deciding whether you should act against the other person, you should consider whether the other person _actually_ did something wrong—while they might have acted out according to the rules of your beliefs and background, their actions might have been innocent from their or others’ perspectives. In this case, acting against them might paint _you_ as the unjust person and decrease your power rather than strengthen it.)

### Rule #5: Become an Inspiring Leader

Fifth, Jackson and Greene argue that **fearlessness involves becoming an inspiring leader—someone who both you _and_ others believe in**. First, believe in yourself intensely to the point where failure is not an option—you’re _convinced_ that you’ll succeed. Doing this is crucial because you can only achieve what you _think_ you can achieve.

Once you have this intense belief in yourself, share your dream with others and convince them to believe in you as well. This authority will grant you power and success.

> **Emotional Intelligence Is the Key to Becoming an Inspirational Leader**
> 
> In _[Primal Leadership](https://shortform.com/app/book/primal-leadership/1-page-summary),_ Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis, and Annie McKee agree that believing in yourself is crucial to creating an inspired following and achieving success. However, they argue that many people lack the self-confidence necessary to inspire others and achieve their wildest dreams because they have _low emotional intelligence_—they’re unable to understand and manage their own emotions (including negativity and self-doubt), which often prevents them from being able to understand and effectively interact with others.
> 
> They explain that the key to overcoming self-doubt and fear—and, in turn, becoming an inspirational leader—is to [practice and improve on the four skills of emotional intelligence](https://shortform.com/app/book/primal-leadership/1-page-summary#part-1-what-is-emotional-intelligence):
> 
> - _Self-awareness_: understanding your emotions and accurately assessing your strengths and weaknesses
>     
> - _Self-management:_ managing and rationalizing your emotions
>     
> - _Social awareness:_ understanding others’ perspectives
>     
> - _Relationship management:_ using empathy to understand and manage your relationships
>     

Jackson and Greene present three principles for believing in yourself and convincing others to believe in you as well.

#### Principle #1: Break Societal Conventions

The biggest obstacle preventing us from achieving our wildest dreams is believing in societal conventions—what people tell us is and isn’t possible. Jackson and Greene argue that you can do _anything_ you want if you believe you can. **Consequently, don’t let the beliefs of society impact your goals or your belief in your ability to achieve them**.

(Shortform note: In _[Bold](https://shortform.com/app/book/bold),_ Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler agree that thinking unconventionally and autonomously (breaking societal conventions) is crucial to becoming a successful, inspiring person. However, they warn that it can be hard to maintain this approach when facing barriers. To maintain this mindset, they [recommend creating a list of facts that will inspire you to stay committed](https://shortform.com/app/book/bold#psychological-strengths)—for example, “people thought electricity was a fantasy until someone broke societal conventions and made it real.” Revisiting these facts when your doubts are plaguing you will remind you that breaking societal conventions is important.)

#### Principle #2: Find a Driving Purpose

Jackson and Greene argue that **one of the best ways to gain power and success is to believe that it’s your purpose in life to do so**. Believe that a higher power is laying out a path to success for you. Not only will this help you believe in yourself, but it’ll also motivate you to persist through any obstacles or doubts you might face.

(Shortform note: In _[The Success Principles](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles),_ Jack Canfield reiterates the importance and benefits of finding a driving purpose. He also explains _how to find_ your purpose: Ascertain your true passions (the things that make you happy and fulfilled) and desires in life. [To find your passions,](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principles-2-3#find-your-purpose) you could list the times you’ve felt the happiest in life or take a “[passion test](https://static.oprah.com/pdf/passion-hexagon.pdf).” [To identify what you truly want in life,](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principles-2-3#exercises-to-identify-what-you-want) you could identify 20 things you love to do or write 30 things you want to be, have, and do before you die.)

#### Principle #3: Present Your Path to Success to Others

**Once you’ve found your path to success, tell others about it and explain to them how exactly you’ll follow it**. Be passionate and emotionally compelling, and rally people behind a common cause. According to Jackson and Greene, this will convince people that you and your goal are worth believing in.

(Shortform note: In _[Bold](https://shortform.com/app/book/bold),_ Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler agree that achieving large-scale success (like becoming a world-renowned rapper, as Jackson did) requires you to inspire people and get them to rally behind your cause. They elaborate that [the best way to achieve this is by creating a compelling story](https://shortform.com/app/book/bold/1-page-summary#how-to-create-an-open-network). This story should follow a logical progression and emotionally appeal to others by explaining how your goals (like becoming a rapper) will benefit them and why they’re important. The story should also use keywords that appeal to your target audience.)

### Rule #6: Overcome the Fear of Death

Finally, Jackson and Greene argue that **the possibly most important rule of fearlessness is to overcome the fear of death**. Most people struggle to follow this rule because it’s our natural instinct to fear death—this is what keeps us alive. However, when we fear death, we repress thoughts about our mortality and embrace the more desirable but unrealistic fantasy that we have infinite time—not just to _live_, but to accomplish our goals. This ultimately leads to inaction—when we don't take our finite lifespan seriously, we lack the sense of urgency needed to follow the previous five rules and succeed.

**To overcome the fear of death,** **Jackson and Greene argue that you must reach a state of transcendence**—a higher level of awareness in which you _accept_ and _appreciate_ the universal process of life and death. You’ll learn to accept that death is a natural part of life—it’s neither good nor bad. Once you do so, you can connect to a deeper life purpose and develop a sense of urgency to achieve power and success before your time is up.

> **How to Accept Mortality and Succeed in Life**
> 
> In _[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck)_, Mark Manson reiterates that people naturally fear death and that accepting your mortality is crucial to living a successful and fulfilling life. However, his perspective on what it means to fear mortality and how to overcome this fear differs from Jackson and Greene’s.
> 
> First, while Jackson, Greene, and Manson agree that fearing death makes your life less meaningful because you’ll fail to truly succeed, their ideas of what it means to reach “true success” and accept mortality differ. Jackson and Greene argue that accepting mortality means appreciating the universal process of life and death—this acceptance leads to true success by creating a sense of urgency to gain _power_ (as discussed earlier). Meanwhile, Manson believes that [accepting mortality means considering how you’ve impacted the world during your lifespan](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/chapter-9). He believes that accepting mortality leads to success by encouraging you to get _rid_ of selfish goals and values—like gaining power.
> 
> Further, while Jackson and Greene recommend overcoming your fear of mortality by reaching a state of transcendence where you accept the _universal_ process of life and death, Manson takes a more personal approach. Rather than focusing on the vastness of existence in general, he argues that [you should focus on your personal identity and whether or not your values make your life feel meaningful](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/chapter-9#accepting-the-reality-of-death). Aim to do the most good with your time while you're alive.

To develop a sense of transcendence so you can overcome the fear of death and the inaction it causes, Jackson and Greene recommend following two principles.

#### Principle #1: Experience Awe

**To reach a state of transcendence, Jackson and Greene argue that you must experience feelings of awe.** They explain that people often have a mundane, standard life—they never do awe-inspiring things that open their eyes to the true nature of life, death, and the universe. Consequently, they lack passion and develop a myopic perspective that prevents them from seeing the big picture, developing a sense of urgency, and achieving power and success.

(Shortform note: Researchers reiterate that experiencing awe is important, but their findings seem to contradict Jackson’s and Greene’s argument in a few ways. First, they say [that awe actually makes people feel like they have more time](https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/GGSC-JTF_White_Paper-Awe_FINAL.pdf), which would _decrease_ their sense of urgency according to Jackson and Greene’s argument. Further, they argue that awe makes people less self-focused and materialistic—so, possibly less likely to strive for individual power and success, as Jackson and Greene suggest.)

To develop a sense of awe that will help you break this pattern, Jackson and Greene make two main recommendations:

**First, regularly step out of your comfort zone.** Leaving your comfort zone forces you to break your mundane patterns and realize that you can accomplish more in life. This will reignite your sense of awe and passion, helping you reach a state of transcendence.

(Shortform note: While Jackson and Greene recommend stepping out of your comfort zone specifically to _experience awe_, experts explain that this practice [has numerous other benefits that will also increase your chances of being successful](https://www.theguesthouseocala.com/4-benefits-of-stepping-outside-of-your-comfort-zone/). For example, leaving your comfort zone boosts your creativity, increases your self-confidence, gives you more opportunities to grow, and teaches you more about yourself, which can improve your mental health.)

**Second, experience things that are vast and make you feel small**—for example, expose yourself to the vastness and beauty of nature or think about the numerous species of life on earth. This will remind you of the expansive nature of life, death, and the universe. You’ll recognize that there’s so much more to life than your mundane routines, which will reignite your sense of transcendence and passion.

(Shortform note: There are arguably more important benefits to larger-than-life experiences than just developing a sense of transcendence and urgency. Experts explain [experiencing the vastness of life and feeling awe can improve your physical and mental health](https://www.nathab.com/blog/nature-travel-the-health-benefits-of-awe-and-anticipation/)—awe decreases inflammation, and it also protects the body from chronic diseases and health problems like Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and heart disease.)

#### Principle #2: Put Things Into Perspective

Jackson and Greene argue that putting things into perspective—acknowledging the natural and infinite cycle of life, death, and the universe—will help you get comfortable with the idea of death, reach a state of transcendence, and develop a sense of urgency in life.

**Putting things into perspective means acknowledging that life and death are natural and neutral—neither good nor bad**. Remember that life has existed for millions of years before you and the universe will exist for billions more after you. Trillions of people have lived, died, and been forgotten, and this will eventually happen to you too—it’s nature. However, right now, you’re alive, so you must use your time wisely while you have it.

The more you think about the natural cycle of life and death for all things and the infinite nature of the universe, **the more you’ll become comfortable with the idea of death and value the limited time you have while living.**

> **The Role of Religion in Accepting Death**
> 
> Jackson and Greene argue that you can overcome the fear of death by putting your life into perspective and accepting that your mortality is part of an ancient, natural, and universal order. This is a primary role of many religions—to help people understand and accept death and the natural order. However, [different religions espouse different levels of acceptance when it comes to death](https://uofazcenteronaging.co/care-sheet/providers/religion-and-end-life-part-1-how-different-religions-view-end-life/).
> 
> For example, in Buddhism and Hinduism, death is viewed as a natural part of life and is accepted rather than fought near the end of one’s life. These religions recommend avoiding heavy medication and treatments near death—in other words, not delaying death. Thus, they seem to preach total acceptance of death as a natural, universal process, as Jackson and Greene encourage.
> 
> On the other hand, Christianity and Islam have a different view of life and death. While they also teach that death is part of the natural order and should be accepted, their followers generally try to extend life for as long as possible through treatment and medication. As these religions generally fight death when it approaches, it seems that they don’t accept death as wholeheartedly as Jackson and Greene recommend. Therefore, people of these beliefs may struggle more than usual to truly accept death as a neutral, natural process.
