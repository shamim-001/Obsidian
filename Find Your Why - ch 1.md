# Find Your Why

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Chapter 1: Why Having a Purpose Matters

Sinek argues that finding your Why or purpose can help you make better choices in your work and your life that lead to greater fulfillment. That’s what he found in his own life after struggling with depression until he identified [his purpose](https://simonsinek.com/simons-bio/): “To inspire people to do what inspires them so that, together, we can change our world for the better.” He then began to help others find their purpose, most famously through his popular 2009 [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4) and by working directly with individuals and organizations.

Besides coaching and giving talks, Sinek shared his ideas about the centrality of purpose through his bestselling book, _[Start With Why](https://shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why)_, also published in 2009. In that book, he outlined his theory that the most successful organizations are the ones that have a clear purpose and stick to it as they grow.

At the center of Sinek’s theory is a model he uses to illustrate the connection between your Why (purpose), your How (methods and practices), and your What (actions and outcomes). We will explore his model in more detail in Chapter 2 of this guide.

After several years of working directly with some organizations, Sinek realized that to achieve his purpose, he needed to broaden his impact. To provide practical help to more people, he co-wrote _Find Your Why_ with David Mead and Peter Docker: a follow-up book that lays out a step-by-step process for discovering your purpose that individuals and organizations can follow.

> **Is the Search for Purpose Inherent?**
> 
> Sinek’s concept of a Why or purpose isn’t new. In 1946, psychologist Viktor Frankl argued that [the driving force in our lives is meaning](https://shortform.com/app/book/man-s-search-for-meaning#part-ii-logotherapy), not pleasure or power, as other schools of thought at the time suggested. In [Man’s Search for Meaning](https://shortform.com/app/book/man-s-search-for-meaning), he outlines three paths to finding meaning that fall under Sinek’s umbrella of “life-changing events”: [action and achievement, love and connection, and suffering](https://shortform.com/app/book/man-s-search-for-meaning/chapter-4).
> 
> Frankl also argued that the meaning of life isn’t universal, but rather something each person must [find for themselves](https://shortform.com/app/book/man-s-search-for-meaning/chapter-3#what-is-the-meaning-of-life), just as Sinek believes everyone has a unique purpose they must discover. Their definitions of purpose and meaning are similar, despite originating in widely different contexts—this suggests that humans have an inherent desire to ascribe meaning and purpose to life.

We’ll explain Sinek’s theory of purpose in the first three chapters of this guide. The following three chapters cover how to prepare for the purpose-discovery process, how to follow the process, and what steps to take afterward. These chapters bring together the steps for individuals and teams, highlighting where the steps differ depending on the audience.

### What Is Your Purpose?

According to Sinek, “finding your Why” means finding your purpose: the single core belief that inspires you to do the work you choose to do and be the kind of person you want to be in your work, home, and family life. Sinek believes every individual and organization has a purpose, though not everyone has discovered theirs yet, or put it into words. He argues that your purpose solidifies in your twenties and stays constant. (Shortform note: Sinek's argument that your Why is fixed by your twenties adds weight to Meg Jay's assertion in _[The Defining Decade](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-defining-decade/1-page-summary)_ that [your twenties are the time to lay down a strong foundation for a successful life](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-defining-decade/introduction). You’re better equipped to do so if you have a purpose, and you know what it is.)

Sinek acknowledges the counterargument that you’re not the same person in your forties, for example, as you were in your twenties, so your purpose will probably change throughout your lifetime. But while he concedes that life events can temporarily throw you off course from your purpose or make you reassess your priorities, he says events can’t change your core purpose.

(Shortform note: Sinek’s belief that everyone has a single purpose that remains true throughout their lifetime doesn’t match [findings from research on purpose](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_purpose_changes_across_your_lifetime). According to studies, people’s search for and engagement with their purpose evolves through different stages of life. During our teenage years, we take an exploratory approach to purpose that becomes more urgent as we become adults and feel the pressure to have certainty on what our purpose is. Finally, during our senior years, we again take an exploratory approach after the things that gave us purpose during adulthood, including raising a family and having a career, become past accomplishments, and we look for new applications of our skills.)

### The Benefits of Discovering Your Purpose

Sinek discusses three benefits of knowing your purpose:

**1. When you know your purpose,** **you can identify work that fulfills you**—that is, it makes you feel you're part of something bigger and that your work matters. Sinek believes that everyone, no matter their role or status, deserves to find fulfillment at work.

People often mistake happiness for fulfillment, but Sinek argues they aren’t the same. Happiness is temporary, but fulfillment stays with you. For example, happiness might look like getting a raise, successfully navigating a challenge, or receiving recognition for a job well done. It only lasts a short time. On the other hand, fulfillment looks like being motivated to do your work because the work itself is rewarding to you, not because of the pay or the recognition. Sinek says it’s a grounding feeling that stays with you even if you don’t get that raise, if you make a mistake, or if there’s no one around to see you do great work.

> **Hits and Misses of Sinek’s Approach to Fulfillment**
> 
> Sinek’s approach to fulfillment differs from traditional career advice in distinguishing between fulfillment and happiness. Typical advice often [conflates the two or sees them as operating in tandem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2020/08/31/a-definition-of-career-success-and-why-so-few-people-ever-experience-it/?sh=8ceae1c4dd2f).
> 
> Additionally, his understanding of fulfillment as a human need is in line with long-standing theories from psychology. Psychologist Abraham Maslow theorized that we have five needs: physiological needs, and needs for safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization, or fulfillment of our potential.
> 
> However, Maslow’s theory organizes human needs from most to least important, putting self-actualization last. We must meet physiological needs, like food, water, and shelter, then address safety needs, and so on. Sinek’s view that everyone should have fulfillment at work glosses over the fact that many people work to meet more basic needs.
> 
> Additionally, Sinek may be giving fulfillment more weight than it warrants. In his hierarchy of needs, Maslow placed “self-actualization” at the level of least priority because [self-actualization is the only level of need that doesn’t cause a person harm if they don’t achieve it](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-guide-to-the-5-levels-of-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs#what-are-the-5-levels-of-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs).

**2. Knowing your purpose makes you** **more persuasive**. Your energy and commitment to your purpose are contagious, so whether you want people to hire you, buy from you, or work with you, having a clear purpose helps you pitch your ideas in ways that sound more meaningful and attractive to others. For example, nonprofits that effectively communicate their purpose inspire people who believe in it to volunteer their time and skills.

(Shortform note: Jack Canfield, author of _[The Success Principles](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles)_, agrees with Sinek that having a clear purpose will help others connect with you and inspire them to join you. Further, he contends that communicating your purpose in a compelling way is [one of the main skills you need to become a great leader](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principle-43#skill-1-communicate-a-compelling-vision).)

**3. Knowing your purpose helps you** **make better decisions**. Your Why works as a compass directing you to the right opportunities—those that further your purpose—and keeping you from time and resource drains.

For instance, instead of taking on a client who’s difficult to work with and tarnishes your reputation, you’ll realize ahead of time that their values don’t align with yours, and you’ll therefore avoid them.

(Shortform note: In _[Essentialism](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/1-page-summary)_, Greg McKeown suggests practical ways to filter out nonessential pursuits using your purpose: Learn to [set boundaries](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/part-3#set-boundaries) and [say “no” gracefully](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/part-3#say-no-gracefully), learn to say “no more” to time or money investments that [no longer serve you](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/part-3#cut-your-losses), and have an editor’s mindset—[eliminate everything except what’s essential](https://shortform.com/app/book/essentialism/part-3#think-like-an-editor).)

#### How Individuals and Organizations Benefit From Finding Their Why

Sinek says that making better decisions and being more persuasive benefits individuals, entrepreneurs, and organizations. Let’s explore the specific ways these benefits of having a clear purpose apply to each group:

**1. Individuals:** Knowing your purpose helps you get clear on what moves you. It can **inject new passion** into your work if it’s already fulfilling, or it can **direct you toward a more fulfilling path**. (Shortform note: Research confirms this. People with a clear sense of purpose [experience fewer negative emotions, have a more secure self-image, and earn more money](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evidence-based-living/201906/knowing-your-why-is-good-you).)

**2. Entrepreneurs:** A defined purpose helps you identify and appeal to the right potential investors, clients, and customers—those with whom your message will resonate. (Shortform note: In _[To Sell Is Human](https://shortform.com/app/book/to-sell-is-human),_ Daniel Pink notes that [entrepreneurs must constantly sell](https://shortform.com/app/book/to-sell-is-human/part-1#origin-2-rise-of-technology-and-entrepreneurship) their vision to investors, clients, or employees. Believing that what you're selling serves a larger purpose [makes you a more effective salesperson](https://shortform.com/app/book/to-sell-is-human#step-2-make-it-purposeful).)

**3. Organizations:** Knowing your organization’s purpose helps you in three ways:

**First, you can increase the loyalty and creativity of your employees or members by involving them in your purpose.** This can make your success more sustainable than that of organizations driven solely by profit.

**Second, you can motivate and guide your teams by showing them the unique role they play** within the organization and how they contribute to its broader purpose.

**Third, you can more easily find and keep the right people.** When you know your purpose, you can hire for what Sinek calls “cultural fit.” This matters because while you can fill skill and experience gaps through training and support, it’s hard to inspire and harness the potential of a team misaligned at its core. (Shortform note: Hiring for cultural fit can devolve into simply hiring people you identify with, which can make your organization’s culture homogeneous and unwelcoming to people from different backgrounds. Some culture experts suggest [vetting candidates on specific cultural values and setting up objective frameworks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulspiegelman/2021/03/01/is-hiring-for-culture-fit-perpetuating-bias/?sh=3b06c00f55e8) to avoid this pitfall.)

> **Additional Benefits of a Clear Purpose**
> 
> Besides harnessing a team’s loyalty and creativity, Chip and Dan Heath argue in _[The Power of Moments](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments)_ that a shared purpose sustains a team through challenges and boredom by [keeping their work connected to a larger, meaningful mission](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-moments/chapters-10-12#strategy-3-reconnect-members-with-their-works-meaning).
> 
> Also, as Gen. Stanley McChrystal explains in _[Team of Teams](https://shortform.com/app/book/team-of-teams)_, when specific teams [share an understanding of how each contributes to the purpose of the organization](https://shortform.com/app/book/team-of-teams/chapter-7), they avoid working in [silos, pursuing individual goals that hinder the achievement of the larger mission](https://shortform.com/app/book/team-of-teams/chapter-6).
> 
> Finally, Sinek contends that using your purpose to guide hiring decisions helps you avoid defaulting to tribalism. You can seek out people who are aligned with it, regardless of their demographics or affiliations, and [take advantage of that diversity to push the mission forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8EVzdCBvoA).
