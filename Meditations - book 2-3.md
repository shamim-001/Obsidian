## Books 2-3: Examine Life and Death Rationally

Now that we’ve covered Aurelius’s dedications, in Books 2-3 we’ll begin introducing some key concepts of Stoicism. We'll start by discussing how to observe every object and event clearly and logically, without being distracted by popular beliefs about those things or the false importance that people create around them.

Then, we'll take our first look at the topic of death. **Facing death calmly and with dignity is a key aspect of Stoicism and is a subject that we'll return to several times throughout _Meditations_.** For now, though, we'll simply discuss how mortality can be motivational, rather than frightening.

### See Things as They Are

**You should always be able to identify and define whatever you encounter**—every object, person, and situation. Your definitions should be reasonable and accurate, not based on emotional reactions or illogical superstitions.

Furthermore, you should know what parts go into making the thing in question, what its purpose is, and how you should deal with it (or if you even need to). Finally, you should know what brought you into contact with this thing: for example, the will of the gods, random chance, or the actions of another person.

**In other words, before you react to anything, make certain that you understand it clearly. Always proceed with logic, not emotion.**

#### Understand Yourself

You can even apply the principle of seeing things as they are to yourself and so come to understand yourself better. **You’re made of flesh, spirit, and intelligence.** These are the things that come together to give you life, and when you die they merely separate again, with no harm done to any of them.

Of those three elements, the flesh is by far the least important. You shouldn’t concern yourself with your physical body, which is nothing more than a messy tangle of blood and bone. Your body is just a vessel, and you'll throw it away when you're done with it.

The Stoics call spirit _pneuma_, and it’s considered to be the “breath of life.” Put simply, spirit is the force that animates you. However, although necessary, spirit is really nothing but air; and never the same air twice. You endlessly recycle your spirit as you inhale and exhale.

Intelligence, however, is by far the most important element of these three: You’re ruled by your intelligence. In the end, the mind is all that matters—your mind is what you really are.

### Remember That You'll Die

**You could die at any moment.** That thought should guide your actions every day. You should consider how long you've been putting off the things you mean to do, and realize that your time to do those things is quickly running out.

Approach every task as if it’s the last thing you'll ever do and the final thing you'll be remembered for. Spend every minute focused on what’s in front of you, doing your work with sincerity and care.

To remain focused, avoid distractions and throw away possessions that might distract you. For example, if someone finds himself drawn to frivolous books for entertainment, he should get rid of those books so he won’t be tempted by them.

If you find yourself getting constantly distracted, make time to learn new things and enrich your life, rather than letting yourself get pulled every which way by passing fancies. **People who work without focus, who have no direction in life, are wasting their time even when working.**

Therefore, you must discipline your mind. Be in the habit of examining your thoughts and weeding out anything irrelevant to the task at hand. Additionally, always rid yourself of any thoughts that are selfish or malicious. **Your** **thoughts should be so straightforward and selfless that if someone asks what you're thinking about, you can answer immediately and honestly.**

Finally, a major distraction that everyone should forego is worrying about what others think or do. Examining other people is a waste of time and energy and will only bring you grief. **Instead, mind your own business and focus on yourself.** The one exception to this is when you're concerned about other people for the common good—for example, you should be concerned if someone’s behaving recklessly and endangering those around them.

#### Decide How You’ll Live Your Life

Consider the question: Will you follow _logos_, or do something else with your life? Make your decision clearly. **Make that decision only once, and stick to it for life.** Anything else is a waste of your limited time.

Someone who lives by _logos_ doesn’t get swept away by pleasure or pain. He has no concern for what others do or think. He keeps his composure no matter what happens to him, because he knows that worrying is both unnecessary and unhelpful.

If you find something better than living by this rational logic—the logic that drives you to honesty, discipline, courage, and justice—then it must be something really extraordinary. Embrace that better thing fully.

However, if you can’t find something more important or more meaningful than _logos_, then there should be no room in your life for anything _but logos_.

### Don’t Fear Death

You should live with the knowledge that you'll eventually die and use that knowledge to stay focused on your work. **However, that doesn’t mean that you should fear death.**

Death is a natural and necessary process, and there’s no reason for a rational person to be afraid of it. You can be sure of this because the gods have given you the intelligence, skills, and tools that you need to avoid harm; therefore, if death were harmful, they would have given you a way to avoid it.

Furthermore, the gods and nature don’t act randomly, letting good and bad things happen to good and bad people respectively. However, everyone experiences life and death—along with pleasure and pain, and success and failure—so you must conclude that these things are neither good nor bad. They simply exist. If death isn’t bad, then there’s no reason to be afraid of it.

**Nobody knows what happens after death, but there’s no reason to fear that, either.** If you go on to another life, then that place must surely have gods as well. They won’t allow any harm to come to you. If, however, there’s nothing after death, then it means you'll be free of pleasures and pains; free of the concerns of your failing body. Neither possibility should scare you.

#### Let Go of Longevity

**As you contemplate the prospect of death, remember that there’s no intrinsic benefit to living a longer life.** All that a person ever has is the present moment, and that moment is all that’s lost upon death.

If I were to live 50 years and you were to live 5,000 years, our lives would amount to the same thing: collections of moments that fade to nothing once they’re past. Therefore, worrying about how long your body will be able to contain your spirit, or exactly when you’ll die, is a waste of time and energy.

Furthermore, as you age, you may find that your faculties start slipping away. The older you get, the more likely you are to lose your reason and logic. Without a healthy mind, you can’t properly determine what your duties are and how to make the most of your time. In other words, you can lose your ability to live _well_, even before you stop living. This is another reason why longevity isn’t a boon.

**In short, in each moment you should decide to do what’s best for you, while you still can.** By doing so, you’ll make the most of whatever life you have, and won’t be concerned about the length of that life.

##### Recognize What’s Best for You

What’s best for you is what benefits you, personally. **As we said before, what benefits you most is probably _logos_.** Living by _logos_ and philosophy is what sets a good person apart from others.

Someone who calmly welcomes whatever fate brings, who clearly sees and understands each situation as it arises, and who lives simply, humbly, and cheerfully, is someone who lives a good life. When the end of that life comes, the person faces it with acceptance and serenity. Nothing could be more beneficial than that.

Finally, **any action that hurts others doesn’t benefit you**—we’re all connected through nature, so harming others will harm you as well. Thoughts that drive you to mean-spiritedness, hypocrisy, or deception are similarly damaging, because they affect your character.

#### Face Life and Death With Philosophy

**Practicing philosophy is the key to living a simple, focused, and fulfilling life.** Philosophy allows you to keep your soul pure, unaffected by good or bad times. It also ensures your integrity and keeps you honest.

Like a doctor keeps his instruments ready in case of emergencies, you should keep your philosophy ready to analyze and understand whatever situations arise in your life. Remember that you need to clearly understand something before you respond to it.

Keep in mind that spiritual practices (like philosophy) and physical practices are connected. You shouldn't take any actions that aren’t in line with your philosophy—however, philosophy is useless if you don’t act on it. Neither type of practice should exist without the other.

Finally, when the time comes, **philosophy will let you face death cheerfully.** Dying is just one more situation that you must analyze with philosophy and respond to accordingly.
