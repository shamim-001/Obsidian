## Chapter 2: One Dream Ends, Another Begins

While my friends headed east to become artists, I was still pondering the intersectionality of biology with literature, morality, and philosophy. I wasn’t sure what the future held for me. Then, one day, I had a sort of divine epiphany---only by being a doctor could I come to learn the answers to my questions. As Whitman had stated, the physician is the only one who can truly discover the physiological-spiritual man. Despite my misgivings as a young man, I was going to become a doctor.

This choice wasn’t an easy one to make. It would require another year of school to get the proper credits just to apply, as well as an 18-month application process. I would also have to turn away from literature. But in doing so, I could start to seek answers from a relationship with those facing life and death.

Some professors felt that leaving academia was a hasty decision. They suggested I use the time I had to study the history and philosophy of science. I was accepted into a program at Cambridge University and headed off to England.

During the program, I became more convinced that to be able to gauge the moral aspects of life and death, I had to address it firsthand. Words were no longer suitable on their own. I finished the year-long program and returned to begin medical school at Yale.

### When Morality Begins to Fade

There’s no way to truly capture the essence of what dissecting your first cadaver is like. Every medical student must traverse through this choppy terrain between life and science. In front of you lies a human that once housed a mind, meaning, breath, and dreams. Yet, at the same time, you see a mere specimen that you will carve up over a period of months to further your educational agenda. The pendulum swings between disgust and misconduct and inspiration and excitement. Eventually, the humanity is drained from you until all that is left is the cold, hard, pitiless face of knowledge and proficiency.

For me, anchored in a pursuit of morality and meaning, this dichotomy was difficult. I found I would often inflate the morose details of anatomy work to friends so I could feign emotion, despite the antithetical reality of how I felt in class.

Still, at times, I couldn’t help but remember that this mass of muscles, cells, and organs had once been a life, even if that remembering was only an admission of disregard. All doctors must draw this line between life and science. The invasion of the body and individuality, the things that are sacred to humans, is what practicing medicine is all about. Thus, the body becomes a mere tool and human suffering the mode of operation. Anatomy class was the vessel that changed us from empathic souls to hardened professionals.

Then, one day, I sliced into my donor, as we were instructed to call them, opening the chest in a way not instructed so I could more easily access other organs. The proctor was beside himself, not because I had performed the procedure incorrectly, but because I had done it without batting an eye. The horror and sorrow in his expression was the most significant lesson I’d learned thus far in my medical training.

### Growing Up and Into My Role as Doctor

In those first two years of med school, I saw how simple it was to view the work as merely that---work. But with the help of my girlfriend, Lucy, I came to see that every aspect of science correlated with an aspect of life. A wavy line on an EKG wasn’t just a heartbeat, it was life coursing through a body.

My comprehension of life, death, and meaning was sharpening. I recognized that the human relationality I’d pondered so often during my previous studies was exemplified in the relationship between doctor and patient.

With the help of Shep Nuland, an esteemed surgeon-philosopher who studied mortality and lectured at Yale, I came to realize that death was not a mystery, but a fact of life. During all of the time researching literature and the history of medicine to get at the truth of death, I had never come to understand it completely. But Nuland taught me that death can only be understood as an existential certainty and by coming toe-to-toe with it.

Death was a personal loss of life, but it was also the rudimentary natural ending of a living organism. Being a doctor, then, was serving as the gatekeeper, shepherding a life to either live another day or succumb to this universal fate. The responsibility of that role felt immense and heroic.

### Am I Up for the Task?

My third year of medical school, I began my hands-on education in obstetrics and gynecology. In this field, new life is the ultimate goal. I was working in the labor and delivery ward, where I witnessed this new life for the first time. I didn’t know at the time that I was also witnessing the first patient who would die.

The pressure on me was light. I was meant to observe and assist the residents and nurses when asked. But inside, the pressure was great. That I might be thrust into the void between life and death, be called upon to deliver a child on my own, was terrifying---more so because failure in this new reality equated to death.

My resident, Melissa, was monitoring the preterm labor of a young woman with twins. Viability starts at 24 weeks, and the twins were a day or two away from that marker. Keeping them inside for as long as possible so they could finish developing was the goal.

At some point in the night, the twins became distressed, requiring an emergency C-section for survival. I stood in the OR and watched as the surgeon cut into the uterus, exposing the face of one of the babies. Out came one baby, then the other, both purple, both no bigger than a handful. They were rushed to the NICU. Their organs were present but unable to manage the task of living.

I left the hospital that morning, feeling as inept as those organs in my role as a doctor. The physical manifestation of medicine was a far cry from the theoretical understanding learned in school. Yet, the next night I was back in the ward, being guided by my attendee as a viable baby was born. I held the baby and felt the tangibility of life in my hands.

After the procedure, I found out that the twins had died, one earlier in the day and one while I was delivering this other baby. The words of Samuel Beckett came to me: “One day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second….Birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it’s night once more.”

I questioned whether the C-section was the correct call. Melissa told me it was up to the doctor’s discretion to decide whether distress in the womb was more advantageous than being born without a viable working system. The most significant decisions I’d ever made were about which sandwich to eat for lunch. I wondered if I would ever achieve that level of discretion. And I wondered how I could live with the responsibility and ensuing results.

It occurred to me that a keen knowledge of medicine wasn’t sufficient. I would have to gain wisdom, or a moral intelligence, to walk that fine line between life and death.
