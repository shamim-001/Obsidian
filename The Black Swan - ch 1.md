## Chapter 1: What Is a Black Swan?

For millennia, it was universally accepted that all swans were white. In fact, this truth was so incontrovertible that logicians would often use it to illustrate the process of deductive reasoning. That classic deduction went like this:

1. All swans are white
2. The bird is a swan
3. The bird is white

But in 1697, Willem de Vlamingh, a Dutch explorer, discovered black swans while on a rescue mission in Australia—and, in an instant, a universal, incontrovertible truth was shown to be anything but.

After Vlamingh’s discovery, philosophers used the term “black swan” to describe a seeming logical impossibility that could very well end up being possible.

Taleb, however, offers a new spin on the term. **He uses it to describe specific historical events with specific impacts**. These events have three salient features:

- They are “outliers” (that is, they are _statistically_ insignificant);
- They have profound real-world impacts; and
- Despite (or perhaps because of) their extreme unpredictability, they compel human beings to account for them—to explain _after the fact_ that they were in fact predictable.

Some examples of Black Swan events include World Wars I and II, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 9/11, the rise of the Internet, the stock-market crash of 1987, and the 2008 financial crisis.

Taleb’s thesis is that Black Swans, far from being insignificant or unworthy of systematic study, comprise the _most significant_ phenomena in human history. We _should_ study them, even if we can’t predict them. Thus, counter-intuitively, we would be better served by concentrating our intellectual energies on what we _don’t_—nay, _can’t—_know, rather than on what we _do_ and _can_ know.

Taleb also claims, also counter-intuitively, that **the more our knowledge advances, the more likely we are to be blindsided by a Black Swan**. This is because our knowledge is forever becoming more precise and specific and less capable of recognizing generality—for example, the general tendency for earth-shattering events to be completely unforeseen (which, of course, is _why_ they’re earth-shattering).

### Platonicity and the Platonic Fold

Like Plato, with his abstract and ideal “forms,” human beings in general tend to favor neat, “pure” concepts that are universally consistent. These concepts—mathematical rules, notions of historical progress, economic laws—allow us to form models of the world so that predictions are much easier to make.

**The problem with these models is that they lead us to “mistake the map for the territory”**—that is, we are fooled into thinking the models _are_ reality, rather than a very particular representation of reality that excludes outliers (i.e., Black Swans).

Taleb calls this natural human tendency to box in reality _Platonicity_ and he holds it responsible for our dangerous confidence in our own knowledge. **We become so enamored of our elegant, self-consistent models that we are unable to see beyond them**.

It’s where our models cease to be useful that Black Swans occur—in the _Platonic fold_ between our predictive models and unpredictable reality.

### The Origins of Taleb’s Black Swan Obsession

Taleb’s first encounter with a Black Swan took place in his home country of Lebanon.

For centuries, the region around Mount Lebanon was known for its cosmopolitanism—located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, at the crossroads of Europe and the Near East, it was home to a vibrant mercantile population that included Christians and Muslims of various sects, Jews, and Druze.

This tolerant and multicultural paradise was still in existence in Taleb’s youth. He recalls the motley crew of international playboys, spies, writers, and merchants that frequented the country.

Taleb was part of the country’s aristocracy. Both of his grandfathers were educated in France, and one of them was serving as minister of the interior when a teenaged Taleb was jailed for participating in a political rally that turned violent. The government was scared enough of the unrest to grant all the arrested protesters amnesty.

Shortly after the rally came the Black Swan that launched Taleb’s obsession: A civil war between Lebanon’s Muslims and Christians that shattered the country’s millennia-long ethnic peace and reduced Beirut, Lebanon’s capital and the “Paris of the Middle East,” to rubble.

**What this Black Swan brought home for Taleb was the blunt unknowability of history.** The war wasn’t—couldn’t have been—predicted; it could only be explained after the fact. He realized that human beings suffer from a “triplet of opacity” when it comes to our encounters with history:

#### 1) The Illusion of Understanding

We all tend to _think_ we have a grasp of what’s going on in the world when, in fact, the world is far more complex than we know.

For example, all the adults around Taleb predicted the civil crisis would last a matter of days (it ended up lasting around 17 years). Despite the fact that events kept contradicting people’s forecasts, people acted each day as though nothing exceptional had occurred.

#### 2) The Retrospective Distortion

History always appears predictable (or, at least, explainable) in our retrospective accounts of events.

In the case of the Lebanese Civil War, **the adults whose forecasts were continually proved incorrect were always able to explain the surprising events _after the fact_**. In other words, the events always _were indeed_ predictable, but one could only predict them _after they’d already happened_.

#### 3) The Overvaluation of Facts and the Flaw of Expertise

We accumulate information and listen to expert analysis of that information, but these elements never measure up to real events.

Taleb cites the example of his grandfather, who eventually rose to deputy prime minister of Lebanon. Although his grandfather was an educated man with years of experience in politics, his forecasts were proven wrong as routinely as those of his uneducated driver. **Neither knew more than the other about the twists and turns of the war**.

Newspapers, too, did nothing to help the Lebanese understand the war. They communicated information, but they didn’t make anyone’s predictions any more accurate. The reporters of the war also tended to “cluster”—emphasizing the same details and using the same categories as each other. Clustering reduces the complexity of the world—and leaves us vulnerable to Black Swans.

(When Taleb was attending Wharton, he learned about “efficient markets”—the idea that trading securities can’t produce profits because all relevant information is publicly available and thus already built into prices. Upon absorbing this idea, Taleb completely ceased to read newspapers or watch television.)

---

In the 1980s, as the war continued to rage, Taleb found himself in business school at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. There, he discovered that the triplet of opacity didn’t just affect his countrymen—it affected his professors and the powerful corporate executives who came to lecture as well. Taleb realized that _no one—_not even the “smartest” businesspeople in the world—was prepared for Black Swan events.

That realization became even more stark on October 19, 1987, when global stock markets crashed.

At the time, Taleb was working for Credit Suisse First Boston; his specialty, honed at Wharton, was “quantitative finance”—the application of complex mathematical models to markets to mitigate uncertainty. Taleb, however, used his knowledge as a “quant” not to apply those mathematical models directly, but to suss out _where those models failed_ and invest accordingly. In other words, whereas everyone else was flying blind and didn’t know it, **Taleb was flying blind and _did_ know it_,_ and he placed bets that would pay off if the models were wrong**.

On the day of the crash, he was vindicated. So much so that his bonus was tantamount to “F*** you” money—that is, it was large enough that he no longer needed to work to earn money. He chose to stay in finance, but he customized his roles so that he could spend ample time in solitude and contemplation.

The focus of his sabbaticals? _Uncertainty_.
