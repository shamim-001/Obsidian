# Why We Sleep

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Chapters 3-5: The Human Sleep Cycle

Now you understand how your sleep rhythm gives a regular schedule of sleep from night to night. Next, we’ll look into how, within a single night, your brain cycles between different phases of sleep. This is important to understanding the function of sleep for your brain.

In summary, your brain switches between two types of sleep—REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. The two types of sleep have different functions:

- NREM clears out old memories and mental “trash,” and moves information into long-term storage.
- REM strengthens the valuable information that remains, and it forges creative novel connections between them.

When you sleep, your brain goes through sleep cycles that each last about 90 minutes. Each sleep cycle generally begins with NREM sleep, then ends with REM sleep. As one cycle ends, the next begins. In total for a single night, there’s about an 80/20 split between NREM/REM sleep. You can see this in a sleep graph here:

![why_we_sleep_cycles.png](./Shortform _ Book_files/why_we_sleep_cycles.png)

(Shortform note: While Walker indicates five stages of sleep—one stage of REM and four stages of NREM—other sources such as the [American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-AASM-Manual-for-Scoring-of-Sleep-and-Associated-Events-2007-.pdf), the [Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/stages-of-sleep), and the [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/patient-caregiver-education/understanding-sleep) say there are four stages: NREM 1, the point of crossing over from wakefulness to sleep; NREM 2, when your heart rate slows and eye movements stop; NREM 3, deep sleep; and REM, the dream state.)

### How Sleep Cycles Change Through the Night

On the graph, notice that not all sleep cycles look the same. As the sleep progresses through the night, a greater fraction of each cycle is spent in REM sleep.

Why would the sleep cycles be unbalanced in this way? Why not just have all sleep cycles look the same, with 80% in NREM and 20% in REM?

Walker hypothesizes that it’s similar to tidying up a house: First, NREM declutters, then REM gets into the finer points of cleaning and organizing.

(Shortform note: One way to think about this is that an animal might be interrupted in the middle of the night. If an animal could only sleep three hours in one night, it’d make sense for the more critical functions to be performed first, with the later functions being a luxury if the animal could sleep a full night. This may suggest that NREM performs a more _vital_ function for survival.)

Also beware of what this means for cutting your sleep short. If you normally sleep eight hours, and one night you have to cut your sleep to six hours, then you’re not just losing 25% of sleep—you might be losing 60-90% of your REM sleep.

Likewise, Walker warns that going to sleep later than usual might cut short your NREM sleep.

(Shortform note: It’s unclear why Walker says that going to sleep at a later time would cut the sleep cycle from the front end—the NREM stage—rather than the tail end, or the REM stage. A report by the Committee on Sleep Medicine and Research states that the [average individual’s sleep cycle begins in NREM 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19956/), regardless of when you go to sleep. The exceptions are newborns and those with neurological disorders such as narcolepsy.)

### What REM and NREM Look Like

REM and NREM are distinguishable by measuring electrical activity in the brain. REM is characterized by fast (30-40 Hz), frenetic activity that looks the same as being awake. Walker explains that wakeful thought looks frenetic because many different neural signals are occurring at once throughout the brain. It’s similar to a roomful of people singing different songs at once. The summation of all the voices just looks like noise.

REM sleep is where dreams happen. A few odd things happen during REM sleep:

- Your sense of time in dreams seems dilated—an hour may seem to pass when in reality only five minutes have.
- Unlike the rest of sleep, you consciously perceive your senses, like sight and sound. In non-REM sleep, the thalamus in your brain blocks you from consciously perceiving senses. Once REM sleep starts, this blockade is released.
- In REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly. This was initially thought to be visual exploration of the dream field, but this turns out to be more related to the _creation_ of REM sleep than passive observation of it.

If REM sleep looks like wakefulness, how can an observer distinguish someone who’s dreaming from being awake? Muscle atonia—**during REM sleep, your voluntary muscles are completely limp**. Your brain does this to prevent you from acting out your dreams, since fighting an enemy might cause you to accidentally punch your surroundings.

> **REM Sleep and Sleep Paralysis**
> 
> Researchers believe that [sleep paralysis is a mix of both wakefulness and REM sleep](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/parasomnias/sleep-paralysis)—some parts of your brain wake up before others, so you’re in a conscious state but the muscle atonia persists. While the exact cause is unknown, studies suggest that those with sleep-related conditions and problems may be more likely to experience sleep paralysis.
> 
> A researcher from Cambridge University suggests [doing the following in the event of a sleep paralysis episode](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00028/full#h3):
> 
> - Remember that there’s no reason to panic because sleep paralysis is harmless and doesn’t last.
>     
> - Think of happy thoughts instead of dwelling on the paralysis.
>     
> - Resist the urge to fight it. Stay calm and still.
>     

In contrast, NREM is characterized by slow (3-4 Hz) waves that propagate far from the frontal cortex to the back of the brain. Instead of people singing different songs, the roomful of people sing one song in unison. That billions of neurons can do this together is awe-inspiring.

What’s the function of these slow NREM waves? By being lower frequency, slow NREM waves can propagate further without attenuation, like AM radio waves. Walker suggests this is useful in **transferring memories far across the brain, from temporary memory stores toward more permanent storage**. It also allows communication across the brain for different sections to collaborate on their shared experience.

(Shortform note: One study suggests that progressing through the NREM stages, going deeper into slow-wave sleep, is connected to the recuperative qualities of sleep. The study found that [study subjects who were awoken frequently reported feeling less energetic](https://www.livescience.com/52646-interrupted-sleep-bad-for-you.html) and generally more irritable than those who got fewer, but continuous, hours of sleep. This effect of interrupted sleep can explain the kind of exhaustion that new parents and doctors on call may feel.)

Walker gives one last detail: Sleep spindles (bursts of activity) occur at the end of slow waves, possibly serving a function to block external sensory input from disrupting sleep. People with more sleep spindles are heavier sleepers.

### How Sleep Changes From Childhood to Adulthood

#### Babies

Fetuses spend almost all of their time in a sleep-like state. They don’t yet have the part of the brain that causes muscle-atonia during sleep, thus explaining why babies in the womb kick and punch.

Walker explains that during the last two weeks of pregnancy, REM sleep in fetuses ramps up to 12 hours a day. This causes rapid synaptogenesis, or the building of neural pathways throughout the brain. In experiments with rat fetuses, disturbing REM sleep stalls construction of the cerebral cortex.

**Alcohol impedes REM sleep in fetuses and babies, causing abnormal synaptogenesis.** Walker suggests that this abnormal wiring of neurons is connected to autism—once the construction of neural connections is disrupted, a fetal brain may never fully regain normal function.

- Newborns of alcoholic mothers spend far less time in REM sleep.
- Two drinks in one sitting reduce subsequent REM sleep and breathing rate in unborn infants.
- When babies drink milk containing alcohol, their REM sleep reduces by 30%.

(Shortform note: Walker originally wrote that “infants of heavy-drinking mothers showed a 200% reduction” in the measure of vibrant electrical activity that indicates REM sleep versus those born of moms who didn’t consume alcohol. In his blog, [Guzey points out the numerical error](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#no-two-thirds-of-adults-in-developed-nations-do-not-fail-to-obtain-the-recommended-amount-of-sleep)—it’s not possible to show a reduction of more than 100%. In his own blog, [Walker acknowledges the error](https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/#Miscellany) and says that the second edition would reflect the correction.)

Walker writes that because REM sleep is involved in emotional recognition and social interaction, disrupting REM sleep in utero might contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder.

- Autistic people show 30-50% less REM sleep than normal.
- Rats deprived of REM sleep develop into socially withdrawn adults.

(Shortform note: A 2020 study found that [sleep difficulties in infants who were later diagnosed with autism may be linked to a change in the size of the hippocampus](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507094747.htm), a key part of the brain related to learning and memory. So far, studies have only found a correlational, not causal, relationship between sleep difficulties and autism.)

#### Childhood

While they’re born with very irregular sleep patterns, babies eventually show more regular sleep patterns starting at four months, as their suprachiasmatic nucleus—the part of the brain that controls circadian rhythms—develops.

With age, total time sleeping decreases, and the fraction of time spent in REM sleep decreases. Walker explains that now that the synaptogenesis of REM tapers off, NREM plays a larger role in brain _refinement_, pruning the associations that are most valuable and unique to that child’s life.

He says to consider NREM to actually _cause_ cognitive development in children—changes in deep NREM sleep always come before cognitive milestones, up until the final cognitive milestone in late adolescence, which is the development of rationality in the frontal lobe.

> **How to Deal With Bedwetting**
> 
> NREM sleep is vital to a child’s cognitive development, so it’s important to manage sleep disruptions like bedwetting, or nocturnal enuresis. This childhood problem has various causes, including sleep apnea, and can make it difficult for both child and parent to go back to sleep after cleaning up. It’s estimated that 25% of five-year-olds wet the bed at least once a month.
> 
> If both you and your child are losing sleep over this, The Sleep Foundation lists some [ways to help you address the problem](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/children-and-sleep/bedwetting):
> 
> - Ask your child if anything is making him worried or sad to help you determine if the cause is something emotional or psychological.
>     
> - Remember that bedwetting is unintentional, so be supportive and don’t punish him for it.
>     
> - Keep a bedwetting calendar and reward him for milestones (e.g., one full week with no bedwetting). While punishment can hurt, giving rewards may help.

> - Make sure he’s hydrated throughout the day and try to keep him from drinking anything an hour or two before bedtime.

#### Teens

In puberty, **teens develop a later biological clock than adults, preferring to stay up later and wake later**. This isn’t just teens being rebellious—it’s in their biological nature. Asking teens to sleep at 10PM is like asking adults to sleep at 7PM.

Walker theorizes that this is evolutionarily helpful for teens to gain independence from their parents (having time to be awake while their parents are sleeping). Moreover, teens do so collectively, and so they get private time to socialize.

(Shortform note: Research from the University of Michigan seems to support this, suggesting that teens are [hormonally driven to stay up late to socialize with peers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762453/?report=classic) away from adults.)

Unfortunately, in modern day, schools start at a very early hour (largely to match the circadian rhythms of adult parents). It’s far out of sync with the natural circadian rhythm of teens, so they tend to sleep late and wake up far earlier than they naturally would.

Considering all this, Walker says that if you’re a parent, there’s no need to get frustrated at your teenage kid for seemingly being lazy and sleeping too much, when their environment is heavily geared against their biological tendencies.

(Shortform note: If pushing for a later start time in your school district isn’t a viable option, you may be able to help your teen get better sleep by enforcing a set bedtime. One study found that [adolescents with parent-set bedtime schedules got more sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21629368/) and were more alert and less tired during the day.)

#### Adulthood and Old Age

Sleep quality starts deteriorating in your late 20s, with deep NREM sleep becoming impaired in length and power. In your late 40s, you’ll get 70% less deep sleep than you had as a teenager; **by age 70, you’ll have lost 90% of deep sleep**. Unfortunately, less NREM sleep worsens your ability to cement new memories as you grow older.

You often hear of the elderly sleeping little at night, so the natural conclusion is that the elderly just need less sleep. But Walker says this could be a myth. The elderly might be sleeping less because they’re _unable_ to sleep for as long. This means they could still benefit from more sleep.

(Shortform note: The National Institute on Aging says that [older adults needing less sleep is a common misconception](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/10-myths-about-aging). Older people still need seven to nine hours of sleep a night.)

##### Why Do Seniors Sleep Less?

Walker notes that seniors have three things that keep them from enjoying more restorative sleep: 1) They sleep less than younger people, 2) they have less efficient sleep, and 3) they want to sleep earlier. This is caused by:

- Degeneration of the mid-frontal cortex that generates sleep
- Weakened bladders causing night interruptions
- Circadian rhythm shifting to earlier times

There are several other factors that exacerbate the poor sleep quality of seniors:

- We’re generally unable to determine our sleep quality after sleeping. When seniors sleep poorly and feel unhealthy, they don’t realize they need to improve their sleep quality. They chalk it up to insomnia.
- Because the elderly sleep poorly, they feel tired during the day, and doze off in the early evening. Unfortunately, this reduces the adenosine sleep pressure at night, which causes them to have trouble falling asleep later. Then, their early circadian rhythm wakes them up before they can get a full night’s rest. This causes a vicious cycle of poor sleep.

(Shortform note: Another factor that Walker doesn’t mention is [menopause, which can cause sleep problems](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/women-sleep/menopause-and-sleep) in middle-aged women. Forty percent of women in their late 40s to early 50s experience issues like insomnia, sleep apnea, and sleep disruption caused by hot flashes or restless leg syndrome. These problems begin at perimenopause and last until postmenopause—a period of about seven years. If you’re at this stage, increase your chances of having a good night’s sleep by avoiding big meals and spicy food before bedtime (as these can lead to hot flashes), reducing stress and managing anxiety that may keep you up at night, wearing lightweight clothes to bed, and having a change of clothes on hand so that you won’t have to get up in case of night sweat. Hormone replacement therapy may help with sleep difficulties but poses risks for some women.)

Walker says that all this causes lower sleep efficiency—people in their 70s have 80% sleep efficiency, meaning they stay awake in bed for 1.5 hours when trying to sleep eight.

There are a few ways for seniors to get better sleep:

- Melatonin helps strengthen the desire to sleep in elderly people. It reduces time to falling asleep and improves reported sleep quality.
- Seniors who want to push their circadian rhythm back should get bright-light exposure in the late afternoon, not in the mornings.

(Shortform note: Seniors who don’t get enough sleep are more prone to accidents and falls, so the [Sleep Foundation suggests some sleep safety tips](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/aging-and-sleep): Keep a phone or a list of important phone numbers on your nightstand, but avoid keeping a cellular phone nearby—the notifications, bright screen, and temptation to scroll can keep you up. Have easily accessible light switches and clear pathways of hazards like cords and furniture to reduce your risk of tripping or falling if you need to get up in the middle of the night.)

#### Shortform Commentary: How Much Sleep Do We Need at Each Stage?

The National Sleep Foundation consulted a panel of 18 experts who reviewed hundreds of sleep studies to determine the appropriate [sleep durations for each age group](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29073412/):

- **Newborns (0-3 months)**—14-17 hours
- **Infants (4-11 months)**—12-15 hours
- **Toddlers (1-2 years)**—11-14 hours
- **Preschoolers (3-5 years)**—10-13 hours
- **School-aged children (6-13 years)**—9-11 hours
- **Teenagers (14-17 years)**—8-10 hours
- **Adults (18-64 years)**—7-9 hours
- **Older adults (65 years and above)**—7-8 hours

Other organizations, such as the [American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://aasm.org/) and the [Sleep Research Society](https://www.sleepresearchsociety.org/), have made similar recommendations.

Babies, young children, and teens need more sleep as they’re still growing and developing. To determine how much sleep you need, the Sleep Foundation recommends [considering your overall health, daily activities, and sleep patterns](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need#:~:text=National%20Sleep%20Foundation%20guidelines1,to%208%20hours%20per%20night.).

### The Ideal Human Sleep Pattern

Walker explains that native pre-industrial tribes show a biphasic sleep pattern, with **seven to eight hours at night and a 30- to 60-minute nap in the afternoon**. At night, they sleep two to three hours after sunset, awaking around dawn. He says there are two reasons this sleep pattern is advantageous:

- All people tend to have a dip in energy in mid-afternoon. (So if you’re scheduling a presentation, avoid the slot right after lunch.)
- A study of Greek siestas showed that people who abandoned siestas (due to political and social pressure) showed a 37% increased risk of death from heart disease compared to those who maintained siestas.

What about supposed historical styles of sleeping, like segmented sleep (two periods of sleep at night, separated by a few hours of wakefulness)? Walker argues this is mostly a remnant of old cultural practices, and not a natural way to sleep. He says that no evidence suggests a biological desire to wake up for a few hours in the middle of the night.

(Shortform note: Award-winning author and professor A. Roger Ekirch, Ph.D. writes that [many cultures in pre-industrial societies practiced segmented sleep](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/39/3/715/2454050) and thought it to be completely natural. According to Ekirch, sleeping more than once a day was common not just in siesta countries like Spain and Italy but across preindustrial Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Australia. While he doesn’t say that segmented sleep was the predominant pattern, he does argue that monophasic sleep is a relatively new way to sleep in Western societies, brought on by artificial lights and changing cultural norms. He adds that some people’s difficulty obtaining monophasic sleep may be the residual effects of a previously dominant pattern.)

Human evolution has changed not only sleep patterns, but also sleep periods. Walker explains that, relative to great apes, humans sleep less (eight hours in humans versus 10-15 hours in apes) and have more intense REM sleep (20% in humans versus 9% in apes). He hypothesizes this evolved as follows:

- Apes sleep in trees and enjoy great safety at night.
- In the human ancestor _Homo erectus_, an upright body posture and shorter arms made sleeping in trees more difficult. REM sleep is also dangerous in trees because limp muscles increase the risk of falling out.
- Discovery of fire allowed humans to ward off predators and parasites at night. But danger still inevitably lurked, so humans who could sleep more efficiently for less time were evolutionarily favored.
- As human societies became more complex, REM sleep became more important. REM sleep is found to be critical for 1) internal emotion regulation, 2) reading emotions from others, 3) creativity. This led to improved survival strategies and larger social groups, which further increased brain complexity and more need for REM sleep, forming a positive feedback loop.

(Shortform note: Research also suggests that the human need for shelter and a warm bed [originated in great ape species](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Fruth_Sleep_AmJPhysAnthr_2018_2627710.pdf), who have been shown to build complex sleeping platforms. This nesting behavior may have contributed to the evolution of great apes and may give us a greater understanding of how human sleep patterns evolved. One theory is that nest-building led to improved sleep quality, which in turn led to better brain function and development.)
