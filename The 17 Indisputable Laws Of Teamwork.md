## 1-Page Summary

Whether they’re winning sports championships or engineering technological breakthroughs, teams can accomplish amazing things. But why do some teams succeed when others fail? According to leadership expert John C. Maxwell, building a high-performing team requires more than getting a group of people together and hoping for the best. In _[The 17 Indisputable Laws of Teamwork](https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/9780785274346/the-17-indisputable-laws-of-teamwork/)_, Maxwell provides 17 pieces of advice compiled over a lifetime of leadership research to help you recruit and organize the right people, align their efforts with a common goal, and create a positive team culture. By following Maxwell’s advice, you can raise your team to its highest potential and achieve your most ambitious goals.

Maxwell is a leadership coach, speaker, and pastor. He’s authored over 70 books, including the best-seller _[The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-21-irrefutable-laws-of-leadership/1-page-summary)_, and founded several organizations that provide leadership training, such as the [John Maxwell Leadership Foundation](https://www.maxwellleadership.com/) and [INJOY Stewardship Solutions](https://injoystewardship.com/).

In this guide, we’ll first briefly discuss why teamwork is crucial for reaching big goals. Then, we’ll explore how you can build a winning team by assembling the right people, fostering a team identity, and cultivating strong team dynamics. Along the way, we’ll share more practical tips to help you make the most of Maxwell’s techniques and supplement his advice with other expert perspectives on leadership and teamwork.

### Why Teamwork Matters

Maxwell writes that **if you want to achieve great things, you need to build a team.** He argues that no one can accomplish anything significant by themselves and that all remarkable achievements require team effort. This is because teams have more energy, resources, knowledge, and perspectives than an individual acting alone. They can leverage their collective strengths to overcome obstacles and innovate solutions. In other words, no matter what you aspire to do, you’ll accomplish more by having a team, whether that team is your family, church group, sports team, or colleagues.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that teams aren’t always more effective than individuals—it depends on [the nature and complexity of the task](https://www.switchboard.app/learn/article/are-teams-more-effective-than-individuals#are-teams-more-effective-than-individuals). For simple tasks, individual effort often prevails, as group work can slow down the process. However, for more complex tasks, groups have an advantage over individuals because they can combine different skills, perspectives, and ideas to find better solutions more quickly. Ambitious goals will likely require both complex and simple tasks, so it may be more valuable to be flexible and alternate between individual and group work based on the task at hand.)

Many people dislike working in teams, and Maxwell advises that if you struggle with teamwork, you should try to identify the reason so you can address it, overcome it, and reap the benefits of teams. He notes several common reasons people are reluctant to work in teams:

- **Ego:** You have a strong sense of self-reliance and want to be able to handle everything without relying on others.
- **Insecurity:** You lack confidence and worry your team members will outperform you.
- **Underestimation:** You underrate how challenging your goals are and think you can easily achieve them by yourself.
- **Personality:** You feel more comfortable working alone.

> **Overcoming the Barriers to Teamwork**
> 
> According to one study, [less than 50% of workers](https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/news/half-hate-teamwork/) enjoy working in a team, which means there’s a good chance you’re resistant to teamwork. While Maxwell doesn’t give detailed suggestions on how to overcome the four most common reasons for resisting teamwork, other experts offer advice you can consider.
> 
> In _[Ego Is the Enemy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy)_, Ryan Holiday defines ego as a sense of superiority that causes you to view others as either a threat or someone who’s below you. To overcome a sense of ego, [focus on doing something](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy#aim-to-em-do-em-something-rather-than-em-be-em-someone) rather than _being something_. For instance, instead of trying to be seen as a self-reliant person, focus on the goals you want to achieve. When you do, you’ll likely realize that working with a team can help you reach them more quickly and easily.
> 
> If you struggle with insecurity, [practice self-compassion](https://shortform.com/app/book/barking-up-the-wrong-tree/1-page-summary#how-to-avoid-the-drawbacks-of-confidence) by being kinder to yourself when you make mistakes and focusing on accepting your true self rather than comparing yourself to other team members. In _[Barking Up the Wrong Tree](https://shortform.com/app/book/barking-up-the-wrong-tree)_, Eric Barker writes that self-compassion is _better_ than confidence because it improves your performance and boosts your mood.
> 
> In _[The 10X Rule](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/1-page-summary)_, Grant Cardone writes that many people underestimate the effort and resources needed to reach their goal. To prevent this underestimation, [multiply your expectations by 10](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/chapter-2#lesson-3-take-extreme-action). By doing so, you’ll likely realize the importance of having other people to provide support and resources.
> 
> Finally, if you consider yourself more of an independent worker, some experts recommend you at least give working in a team a try. In _[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people)_, Stephen R. Covey writes that [collaboration is contagious](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/habit-6#going-deeper). The more you work with others who share ideas openly, the more you may find it easier to collaborate and reap the benefits of teamwork.

### How to Build a Winning Team

Maxwell writes that a winning team is a group of people who unite under a common identity and who trust and support one another to achieve shared goals. In this section, we’ll discuss how to build such a team by selecting the individuals with the right skills and attitudes, creating shared visions and values, and nurturing a culture of trust and positivity.

#### Assemble the Right Team for Your Goal

To build a team that can achieve great things, you need to have the right people on it. Maxwell suggests you **select team members based on the type of goals and challenges you face.** Getting clear on what you’re trying to accomplish and what obstacles you’ll likely face will help you identify people who have the right skills, attitudes, and values for your team.

For example, if you’re venturing into new or unknown territory (like founding a startup), you’d likely benefit from having a creative team. In contrast, if you’re facing a high-stakes challenge (like a sensitive negotiation), you may want team members with track records of relevant experience.

(Shortform note: Maxwell recommends you build a team based on your unique goals and challenges, but other leadership experts contend that it’s more important to [build a diverse team](https://hbr.org/2016/09/diverse-teams-feel-less-comfortable-and-thats-why-they-perform-better). People often assume a team is effective if it works harmoniously toward a goal, but research shows that the most successful teams are those that experience some conflict and disagreement. Conflict leads to deeper discussions, new ideas, and better outcomes. Therefore, instead of focusing only on recruiting creative people for novel endeavors or experienced people for high-stakes challenges, it may be more beneficial to recruit people from a variety of backgrounds, with different attitudes, experience levels, and skills.)

Maxwell adds that assembling your team isn’t a one-time decision but instead is an ongoing process. Once you’ve determined the dream team for your goal, regularly reflect on the current members of your team. If your current team falls short of your ideal team, Maxwell suggests you either find ways for existing members to contribute more value or adjust your team by adding or removing members. We’ll look at how to do so in the following sections.

(Shortform note: In _[The First 90 Days](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-first-90-days)_, Michael Watkins suggests you assess your team members by [sorting them into one of six categories:](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-first-90-days/chapter-7#shaping-your-team) keep in place, keep with development, move positions, replace (low priority), replace (high priority), or continue to observe. While Watkins suggests doing this within your first 30 days as a manager, you can make this an ongoing exercise to regularly assess the members of your team as Maxwell suggests.)

##### Put People in the Right Role

Maxwell writes that as you assemble your team members, you must **put them each in the right role**, where their strengths and talents can add the most value. When people are in a role that suits them, they feel more fulfilled, perform better, and contribute more to the team’s success.

To put people in the right role, assess the strengths and weaknesses of each member. Try to understand each person well to know what responsibilities they can excel at. Consider everything from their experience and skills to their personality and passion.

(Shortform note: In _[Principles: Life and Work](https://shortform.com/app/book/principles-life-and-work)_, Ray Dalio suggests using [personality tests](https://shortform.com/app/book/principles-life-and-work/chapter-9-1#figuring-out-people-types) to understand your team members better. These include the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/myers-briggs-overview/) (which sorts people into 16 personality types) and the [Workplace Personality Inventory](https://www.talentlens.com/career-development/workplace-personality-inventory-second-edition.html) (which assesses traits like persistence and stress tolerance). These tests can reveal a person’s strengths and weaknesses and predict how they’ll behave, communicate, and collaborate with others. With this information, you’ll find it easier to assign people to roles that best suit them and their abilities and help them feel fulfilled.)

##### Remove People Who Hold Your Team Back

As you consider how well people are suited for their roles, you might realize that the right place for someone is simply not on your team. Sometimes, teams have weaker members who hold others back, cause problems, or lack the skills or motivation to contribute to the team’s success. Maxwell suggests you **either develop weak members or remove them from the team.**

(Shortform note: In _[Radical Candor](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor)_, Kim Scott suggests you [ask yourself three questions](https://shortform.com/app/book/radical-candor/chapter-5#3-supporting-low-performance-with-no-growth) to decide whether to let a team member go: First, have you adequately invested in them and given clear expectations? Second, how does this person’s performance affect the team? And third, have you asked for advice from a third party? After reflecting on these questions, you’ll be better equipped to make the best decision for the team.)

Maxwell writes that you can be more or less tolerant of weak links depending on your team’s goals. If your team is operating in a fast-paced and high-stakes environment, it may be more sensible to remove weak members than to train them.

(Shortform note: One example of a team that operates in a high-stakes environment is Netflix. In _[No Rules Rules](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules)_, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings describes his policy of [firing average employees](https://shortform.com/app/book/no-rules-rules/part-1) to make room for exceptional ones. He explains that this strategy is crucial for Netflix to remain agile in a fast-changing industry. However, the company ensures its employees feel valued by paying highly competitive salaries and giving generous severance packages to team members they let go.)

To remove someone from your team, Maxwell suggests you be honest but respectful with them. If removing someone makes you uncomfortable, remind yourself that the good of the team comes first. Ignoring the problem only results in a chain of negative events and prevents your team from functioning at its highest level. Team members will grow resentful toward the weaker members and lose trust in their leader’s ability to do what’s best for the team.

(Shortform note: The authors of _[Difficult Conversations](https://shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/1-page-summary)_ provide some more guidance on how to talk with a team member about removing them from the team. They suggest you start the conversation [in a neutral and objective way](https://shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/chapter-8#first-start-from-the-third-story) by describing the situation as though you were a third-party observer. Then, ask the team member to share their perspective with phrases like “Can you help me understand…” before sharing your perspective. If you’ve already decided to let the team member go, the authors recommend you share the news first and then discuss each other’s views to resolve any negative feelings they may have.)

##### Find Your Team’s Catalysts

Maxwell writes that even high-performing teams can lose steam and stop growing after some time. To keep people motivated, **add a “catalyst” to your team.** Catalysts are go-getters who bring energy and enthusiasm to the whole team. They inspire the team to overcome challenges and see that the necessary work gets done. According to Maxwell, once you have a team of individuals working in roles that maximize their strengths, adding a catalyst can take the team’s performance to the next level.

(Shortform note: Maxwell doesn’t explain why he calls this type of team member a “catalyst,” but a look into the origins of the word can give us some clues. The word “catalyst” originates from chemistry, describing a substance that [speeds up a chemical reaction](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainscatalysts). By adding a catalyst to a mixture of other substances, the reaction happens faster and produces more of the desired product. Similarly, a person who acts as a “catalyst” for a team can have a positive impact on the team’s performance, helping everyone become more motivated and productive and produce desirable outcomes.)

To find a catalyst for your team, says Maxwell, look for a person who communicates well, has passion about what they do, and is creative, talented, responsible, and generous with their time and efforts. Catalysts also take initiative and are intuitive—they sense advantages, weaknesses, and needs before others do. All these traits make them uniquely influential. When you identify a catalyst on your team, Maxwell suggests you help them recognize their role and encourage them to step up as a good influence on the team.

(Shortform note: Research corroborates the benefits of having a catalyst on your team, with one study showing that a single overachiever often has [more influence on a team’s success](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-04971-001) than the rest of the members combined. However, relying too much on one person to carry the team can have negative consequences: Often, the highest contributors [feel the least engaged and satisfied](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload) with their work. To prevent your catalysts from becoming burned out, encourage them to be mindful of their limits and motivate other team members to step up and take more responsibility. This way, you can create a more balanced and effective team that doesn’t rely solely on one person’s responsibility, creativity, generosity, and initiative-taking.)

##### Recruit Support Members

Maxwell suggests you also **recruit supporting members to your team.** These are people who can support your team’s core members in various ways, such as by substituting, assisting, or providing resources. For example, successful sports teams have a strong bench of reserve players, software companies have testers who can support the main developers, and executives have assistants who handle administrative tasks. Recruiting support members gives your team more flexibility, allowing it to capitalize on new opportunities and overcome unexpected challenges.

Maxwell advises that you not only bring support members onto your team, but you also work on developing them to become core members of your team. This way, if you lose key members, you’ll have capable people to fill the gaps. With time and training, your team’s support members may become your team’s most invaluable units.

(Shortform note: There are [numerous benefits](https://thereceptionist.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-additional-office-support-staff/) to adding support members to your team. Support members improve team morale by helping to reduce your core team members’ workload and stress. They also enhance your team’s performance by allowing people to specialize in the type of work they excel at and enjoy. Like Maxwell, other experts say you should develop your support members, and they recommend you consider how they might fit into the team long-term _before_ you bring them onto the team.)

#### Encourage Teamwork Over Self-Interest

Assembling a team of capable individuals is only the starting point, Maxwell writes. Your next step is getting team members to **value the common good of the team and its goals more than their personal interests and desires.** Maxwell notes that people can sometimes be tempted to seek personal glory and recognition. However, this self-interest only diminishes what the team can accomplish as a whole. He suggests several strategies to promote a collective focus among team members.

##### Promote a Shared Identity

Maxwell writes that one way to help people become more team-oriented is to **create a shared identity that unifies your team.** A shared identity gives people a sense of belonging and purpose. When everyone wants similar things and follows the same guiding principles, they’re more motivated and committed to achieving team goals rather than pursuing their own interests. To create a shared team identity, you must establish a compelling vision and meaningful values that everyone can appreciate and embrace.

**1) Create a strong vision for your team.** A vision—a common future everyone aspires toward—aligns your team and gives them direction. When they not only know what they’re doing but also why, they’ll have more confidence and motivation. To be compelling, your vision should encourage integrity, stoke people’s passion, build on your team’s tradition, instill a sense of purpose, have realistic steps to achieving that purpose, and help your team see its potential.

**2) Create meaningful team values.** Creating team values gives your team a unique identity and attracts others with similar values to your team. Collaborate with your team members to come up with values your team can share—for example, honesty, positivity, and fun. To encourage team members to adopt these values, model the values yourself, implement them into your team operations, and praise people when they display the team values.

> **Strengthen Your Team’s Tribal Culture**
> 
> The authors of _[Tribal Leadership](https://shortform.com/app/book/tribal-leadership)_ explain how creating a shared identity transforms your team from a collection of self-interested individuals into a cohesive and collaborative group. They explain that humans naturally form tribes, which are groups with shared social norms and ways of working. A tribe develops through [five stages](https://shortform.com/app/book/tribal-leadership/part-1#tribal-culture-develops-through-five-stages), evolving from a loose affiliation of members—who, despite feeling some loyalty to their group, are largely driven by individual impulses—to a cohesive group that works well together and forms a productive, innovative team that can enact groundbreaking changes.
> 
> According to the authors, only 25% of the modern workforce moves beyond the stages where team members are competitive and individualistic. The authors align with Maxwell in saying that [establishing a vision, or purpose, and a shared set of values](https://shortform.com/app/book/tribal-leadership/part-4#stabilize-the-tribe-at-stage-4) is the key to making this happen, and they advise that to do so, you should [ask each team member](https://shortform.com/app/book/tribal-leadership/1-page-summary#establish-your-values-and-purpose) what they think the team works in service of and have them explain their answers. Then, facilitate a discussion until you reach a consensus that everyone agrees on and supports.
> 
> Like Maxwell, the authors recommend creating values collaboratively with your team, but they add that you should also recruit new members based on those values. One way to do this is to tell a story during the interview that illustrates one of your team’s values. If the candidate can identify the message of the story, then you know they understand the value.

##### Be Willing to Make Sacrifices

Next, for a team to work well toward a collective goal, all members must **be willing to make sacrifices for the team.** Team members must be ready to take risks, put in the hard work to improve their skills and accomplish tasks, and sideline their personal interests for group goals. To build a team willing to make the necessary sacrifices to achieve greatness, Maxwell recommends you lead by example: Show your willingness to make sacrifices, and others will follow suit. Then, praise people who put the team before themselves.

(Shortform note: In _[The Leadership Challenge](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/1-page-summary)_, James Kouzes and Barry Posner agree with Maxwell that to build a strong team, you, as the team’s leader, should first articulate your team's values and next, [live by them](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/principle-1#guideline-2-model-your-values). They write that it's only when people see you "practice what you preach" that they'll follow your lead enthusiastically and be inspired to also commit to those values. Research has shown that direct reports mimic the behavior of their leaders quite closely, and thus, the most effective way to encourage team members to put the good of the group ahead of their own good is to do the same.)

#### Foster Strong Team Dynamics

To create a winning team, you must also foster strong team dynamics by improving how team members collaborate and support one another. Maxwell suggests you do this by **cultivating positivity and building trust among team members.**

##### Keep Things Positive

**To enhance positivity, boost the team’s morale.** A team with high morale more easily overcomes challenges, innovates, takes risks, and performs. Maxwell suggests that if your team suffers from low morale, you should identify and address the root causes of it—for example, by providing your team with more training to boost their confidence in their skills. Then, help your team members feel hopeful and believe in themselves by demonstrating your belief in them.

(Shortform note: Morale is how enthusiastic and optimistic people feel toward their team and their work. [Numerous factors can affect morale](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/team-morale), such as boredom with assigned tasks or work-life balance, so some experts recommend having open feedback channels where team members can share their concerns. This allows you to identify and address the real causes of low morale. In addition, recognize and appreciate team members’ achievements to demonstrate your belief in them and help them feel valued.)

Maxwell says that when you’re trying to improve morale, watch for negative attitudes. Some warning signs you should look out for include the refusal to admit mistakes, being unforgiving of others, acting jealous, feeling more important than others, being overly critical, or claiming all credit.

(Shortform note: In _[The Laws of Human Nature](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-laws-of-human-nature)_, Robert Greene defines attitude as the overarching emotion you filter the world through. Attitudes are malleable and are influenced by genetics, upbringing, and life experiences. People often develop negative attitudes during childhood if they lack support systems. According to Greene, there are [five types of negative attitudes](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-laws-of-human-nature/law-14#five-negative-attitudes): hostile, depressive, anxious, avoidant, or resentful. Each of these is important to watch for on your team.)

Maxwell argues that good attitudes might not ensure success, but bad attitudes will definitely lead to failure. This is because attitudes affect performance—a team that’s positive and hopeful performs better than one that’s pessimistic and doubtful. He suggests you address bad attitudes in the team as soon as possible because attitudes are also contagious. One team member with a bad attitude will not only undermine the team’s morale, cohesion, and performance, but they'll also cause others to become more negative.

To correct negative attitudes, Maxwell suggests you have a conversation with the other person. Share your observations and ask them to explain their perspective. Then, help them change by setting clear expectations and providing support.

> **The Benefits of Positive Attitudes**
> 
> Maxwell focuses on the negative effects of bad attitudes, but what are the effects of positive attitudes? In _[The Happiness Advantage](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage)_, Shawn Achor explains how positive attitudes improve performance: They release chemicals that [activate your brain’s learning centers](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage#principle-1-reap-the-benefits-of-happiness). When this happens, you’re able to think quickly and creatively, solve problems and process new information more effectively, and be receptive to more ideas.
> 
> Achor further explains why attitudes are contagious: Our brains have cells called [mirror neurons](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage/conclusion) that detect the emotions, reactions, and behaviors of people around us, and light up as though we were doing or feeling the same thing. Some team members can even have a stronger impact than others if they’re more expressive or socially connected. Thus, you can spread positivity to your team simply by expressing positivity.

##### Build Trusting Relationships

Maxwell emphasizes that to create a strong, unified team, you must **build trust among team members**. Team members can only perform at their best when they know they can depend on one another.

To build trusting relationships, Maxwell suggests you foster two things within your team:

**1) Reliability.** According to Maxwell, team members must have five traits to be reliable: good character, the necessary skills to fulfill their responsibilities, commitment to the goal, the ability to deliver high-quality results over time, and solidarity in the face of adversity.

**2) Good communication**. Leaders and team members alike should talk openly and frequently with one another with honesty, respect, and vulnerability. Maxwell asserts that when teams communicate well, they can act and perform with efficiency and effectiveness.

> **Practical Strategies for Boosting Trust**
> 
> In _[Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team)_, Patrick Lencioni adds another layer to Maxwell’s definition of trust: Trust means you not only depend on team members to do their part but also [feel safe to admit your mistakes and share unusual ideas](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/1-page-summary#impairment-1-distrust) without fear of judgment. He writes that this is a crucial element of a functioning team because if team members don’t feel safe admitting their mistakes, they’ll likely cover them up instead of asking for help to resolve them, which will inevitably lead to further problems.
> 
> Lencioni agrees with Maxwell that reliability is also necessary to build a strong team, and he offers some tips on how to foster it: He suggests you promote accountability within your team by empowering team members to [give regular feedback](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/1-page-summary#impairment-4-fear-of-accountability) to one another. This helps people feel responsible for their actions and for the outcomes of those actions.
> 
> Lencioni also adds insight into how you can encourage communication in a team, arguing that before team members can communicate openly and honestly, they must first get to know one another. Encourage people to [share information about themselves](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/overcoming-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team#how-to-build-trust-in-a-team), such as by asking icebreaker questions. This allows people to start forming bonds. Because it’s harder to be vulnerable about mistakes and fears, Lencioni recommends that leaders first share a story of failure or embarrassment to let others know it’s safe to share such things.

#### Position Your Team for Success

Once you apply Maxwell’s advice in the previous sections, you’ll have assembled a team with the potential to reach its collective goal. **Your next focus should be helping your team perform at its best.** You can do this by regularly evaluating your team’s performance and encouraging team members to become leaders.

##### Evaluate Your Team’s Performance

According to Maxwell, to achieve its goals, a team must **regularly evaluate its performance so that it can make any necessary improvements**. He recommends identifying clear criteria to measure your progress. For example, a nonprofit organization might evaluate its impact based on people served, funds generated, and amount spent.

Clear criteria allow you to objectively gauge how well your team is doing. This can help you make smarter decisions and adjust your team’s strategies to achieve better results.

(Shortform note: In _[Deep Work](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/deep-work)_, Cal Newport recommends using [lagging and leading metrics](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/deep-work/chapter-7#principle-2-use-the-right-metrics) to evaluate and improve your team’s performance. Leading metrics measure progress, such as the actions you’re taking that _lead_ to your goal—for example, the hours your team spends training or your marketing budget. Lagging metrics measure the outcome, or how well your team _met_ your desired goal—for example, the matches won or sales made. Once you create these metrics for your team, Newport recommends publicly displaying them to keep the team motivated and also celebrate small successes.)

##### Empower People to Become Leaders

Maxwell argues that **a team’s leadership is the key factor that determines whether it performs at its fullest potential and succeeds in meeting its goal.** Good leaders enable their team instead of holding it back. They know how to inspire and motivate people, push their capabilities, and empower them to take on responsibilities.

(Shortform note: There isn’t a single model of an effective team leader, but James Kouzes and Barry Posner write that [good leaders do five things](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-leadership-challenge/introduction-to-leadership#five-principles-of-outstanding-leadership): They lead by example, motivate their team with an inspiring vision, challenge the status quo, empower others to act, and genuinely care about their team. According to research, 96% of team members with these types of leaders feel highly engaged at work, and companies with these types of leaders experience 18 times the net income growth compared to companies with leaders who don’t follow these principles.)

To create a team with strong leadership, Maxwell recommends you **devote time and energy to developing your team members into leaders.** He explains that leadership isn’t a fixed role that belongs to a single person—instead, the role might be better managed by different people depending on the situation. Instead of having the same person make decisions for all tasks and projects, you should delegate leadership to the person with the most experience and capabilities for the task at hand. This allows you to optimize the performance of your team and leverage the unique strengths of your team members.

(Shortform note: In _[Turn This Ship Around!](https://shortform.com/app/book/turn-the-ship-around)_, former US Navy captain L. David Marquet echoes Maxwell’s suggestion to delegate leadership and proposes a [leader-leader model](https://shortform.com/app/book/turn-the-ship-around/introduction#the-leader-leader-model)_: Everyone_ thinks like a leader and decisions are made by those who know the most about the situation. To promote the leader-leader model within your team, have team members state what they intend to do next instead of asking superiors for directions. Marquet says decentralizing decision-making makes the team more resilient and effective in the long run because it doesn’t depend on a single person’s skills and decisions.)
