## Part 2: Strategies for Living Wholeheartedly | Chapters 4, 8-9: Be Yourself

In Part 1, we explored worthiness and the factors that help and hinder its development. Now, in Part 2, we’ll explore Brené Brown’s strategies for living Wholeheartedly. **These are the behaviors that Brown believes develop worthiness and allow us to live a Wholehearted life.**

We’ve reorganized these strategies and grouped them according to three themes:

- Being yourself
- Developing inner strength
- Fostering happiness

We’ve also tried to link each strategy explicitly to worthiness, courage, connection, and/or compassion.

In this chapter, we’ll examine three Wholehearted living strategies that encourage you to accept and be your true self:

- Be authentic.
- Reject comparison.
- Use your intuition.

### Be Authentic

Brown’s first strategy for living Wholeheartedly by being yourself is **being authentic**. But what does it mean to be authentic?

According to Brown, authenticity is a way of thinking and acting: **It’s actively making the decision to show your true self to the world.** This means _all_ of your true self, including the more vulnerable parts—for example, your fears, your imperfections, and your quirks.

> **Accepting _All_ of Your Authentic Self**
> 
> Note that to follow Brown’s advice and show even your most vulnerable parts to the world, you’ll need to learn to _accept_ those vulnerabilities. If you see your fears, flaws, and quirks as things to be ashamed of, you’re going to try to hide these parts of yourself. **This is incompatible with authenticity.**
> 
> The idea of accepting your flaws and vulnerabilities may feel alien. As Tara Brach notes in her book _[Radical Acceptance](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance)_, [Western society teaches us that to be worthy of love and praise, we need to “fix” our flaws](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-1) and vulnerable parts—not _accept_ and _show_ them. However, learning to accept your vulnerabilities is important because it increases your feeling of worthiness. You’ll stop seeing your flaws as evidence you’re “not good enough,” and you’ll instead be able to fully embrace your true self.
> 
> One possible path to accepting your flaws and vulnerabilities is to **recognize them as important and inevitable parts of existence.** As Brach notes, [we’re all imperfect](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-1). Having flaws and vulnerabilities doesn’t mean that there’s something “wrong” with you—just that you’re human, like everyone else. Why waste your energy trying to hide key elements of your humanity that are ultimately nothing to be ashamed of?
> 
> We’ll discuss the idea of accepting your imperfections further in the next chapter, when we explore perfectionism and the harm it can do to Wholehearted Living.

#### Barriers to Living Authentically

Brown acknowledges that **being authentic takes a lot of courage.** Letting the world see who you truly are can be a scary process, not least because, as Brown explains, the process often throws up two major barriers:

**Barrier #1:** **The fear of resistance from your loved ones.** Choosing to live authentically requires you to change your behavior: specifically, to stop hiding parts of yourself and curb any inauthentic behaviors. Brown explains that you may fear that your loved ones won’t accept this new, authentic you, and that this will damage your connections with them. She also highlights that unfortunately, this may happen: Some people _do_ react badly to change, even if this change is a necessary part of a loved one living healthily and authentically.

> **Authenticity Benefits Relationships**
> 
> If your loved ones were to react to your newfound authenticity in a negative way, you could respond by reassuring them that **your move to authenticity isn’t something to fear: It’ll benefit them, as well as you.**
> 
> For example, as Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus argue in their book _[Minimalism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism)_, [when a loved one is authentic, we feel more safe and secure in our relationship with them](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/minimalism/chapter-3) because we know we’re seeing—and love—their true self, not a false front. Your loved ones could experience this added security, were they to overcome their fear of change.

**Barrier #2: The fear of challenging societal expectations.** Brown notes that society demands we conform to certain norms—that we look, act, and think in a certain way. If your true, authentic self doesn’t match up to society’s expectations, you may be afraid to be yourself. What if people reject, criticize, or shame you for failing to conform? The fear of this happening isn’t totally unfounded: Brown points out that societal expectations are so deeply ingrained in our culture that people _do_ often ridicule or shame those who fail to meet them.

> **Pushing Back Against Societal Pressure**
> 
> The pull to conform to social norms can be strong. As Brown notes, we often fear the pushback and rejection that can result from breaking convention. However, this is a fear we must overcome if we want to live as our true, authentic selves.
> 
> **So, how can we resist the pressure to fit societal expectations?** Many authors have attempted to answer this question. For instance, in his book _[Influence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence)_, Robert B. Cialdini suggests that [you can fight the instinct to conform by critically analyzing the behavior that society is trying to push you to adopt](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-4). Ask yourself, will this behavior benefit me in any way _other_ than helping me to conform? If you find that it won’t, you may feel more comfortable rejecting the behavior and acting in the way _you_ want to instead. (Brown also highlights the importance of critically analyzing societal messages when discussing building resilience, a topic we’ll explore in the next chapter.)
> 
> Furthermore, in _[Flow](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/flow)_, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggests that [parents can specifically encourage teens not to conform to societal and peer pressure by showing unconditional acceptance to their children](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/flow/chapter-8): non-conformist traits and all. If teens receive this approval from their parents, they’ll be less likely to seek it from their peers and thus less likely to conform to peer pressure. Presumably, if we raise self-accepting, authentic teens, they’ll grow into self-accepting, authentic adults.

##### Overcoming These Barriers

Brown suggests that to overcome these fears of rejection and pushback, first, acknowledge that embracing authenticity isn’t always the safe option when it comes to pleasing others. However, also accept that **the negative consequences of living inauthentically are much more severe than the criticism you may face for being authentic.**

According to Brown, inauthenticity chips away at your worthiness and may impact your overall mental wellbeing: She argues that it can lead to depression, anxiety, and numerous other mental struggles. Furthermore, inauthenticity is a rejection of self-acceptance and self-love. Deciding that your true self needs to remain hidden reinforces the idea that you’re fundamentally not good enough.

> **The Benefits of Authenticity**
> 
> Research supports Brown’s assertion that being inauthentic is harmful to your mental health and worthiness—and, by extension, that being authentic _benefits_ your mental health and worthiness. One study found that [living authentically leads to greater general life satisfaction as well as increased wellbeing](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1064&context=mapp_capstone). Another [linked living authentically to having high self-esteem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251802973_The_role_of_authenticity_in_healthy_psychological_functioning_and_subjective_well-being)—or as Brown would call it, worthiness.
> 
> Authenticity might also bolster your career prospects. Some authors argue that **if you work in business or sales, being authentic may be the difference between success and failure.** For instance, in his book _[Start With Why](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why)_, Simon Sinek argues that being an authentic and honest salesperson, rather than an off-putting, manipulative one, [will help you to build long-lasting relationships with customers](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why/chapter-5) and become more trustworthy.

### Reject Comparison

We all tend to compare ourselves to others. However, Brown’s next strategy for living Wholeheartedly (and being yourself in the process) involves **rejecting the temptation to do this due to the emotional damage that comparison can do.** Instead of comparing ourselves to others, we should be happy to be who we are.

In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown presents the chapter on comparison as an exploration specifically of how we can _use creativity to stave off unhealthy self-comparison to others_. Before we address this point about creativity, let’s learn about why we should be avoiding comparison in the first place: in other words, why it’s so damaging.

#### The Problem With Comparison

According to Brown, comparison’s damage lies in the fact that it involves both **competition** and **conformity**. She acknowledges that at first, this might seem counterintuitive. How can we both compete with others _and_ strive to conform at the same time?

To address this question, Brown argues that **competition and conformity feed into each other when you want to be the “best” in your particular social or societal group**—when you want to conform to that group’s standards and do so “better” than everyone else. You abandon attempts to be and accept your true self, as well as efforts to see your own worthiness. Instead, you focus on “winning” in comparison to your peers.

(Shortform note: Comparison is also arguably at odds with two of Brown’s “gifts of imperfection.” **Comparison can harm your connections with others:** If you compare yourself to someone and decide that you’re “worse” than they are, you might become jealous or envious. These negative feelings will erode your bond. Likewise, comparing yourself to someone else and deciding that you’re “better” than they are (and, by extension, they’re “lesser”) isn’t a good foundation for a strong, equal connection—**and it isn’t particularly compassionate, either.**)

> **Is Comparison Always a Bad Thing?**
> 
> In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown frames comparison as a strictly negative practice because of its harm to worthiness. But **can comparison ever be a good thing?**
> 
> Some research indicates that comparing ourselves upwardly to others—in other words, comparing ourselves to people who we view as “better” than we are in some way—can actually have some positive effects. These include:
> 
> - [Improving our self-esteem,](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.456.7776&rep=rep1&type=pdf) if we realize we have things in common with the person we think is “better” than we are. Clearly, we’re as “good” as they are in some respects.
>     
> - [Facilitating self-improvement.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-01271-001) Realizing that someone is “better than us” in a certain area can help us to improve, as we can learn from this “better” person and improve our own performance. This “better” person can also serve as an inspirational figure to motivate us to improve.
>     
> 
> Furthermore, a review of studies on social comparison in students found that [students who compared themselves upwardly to higher-performing classmates improved their academic performance](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0034654308321210). However, **the same review of studies notes that upward comparison also had _harmful_ effects on students**, such as feeling negative emotions and judging their own academic abilities more harshly. In sum, whether upward comparison can ever be _wholly_ positive is unclear.

#### Using Creativity to Fight Comparison

If comparison is so damaging, why do so many of us engage in it? The answer is that **letting go of comparison can be a tricky task:** As Brown notes, this way of thinking is deeply ingrained in many of us.

However, Brown believes that you can reduce your temptation to compare by recognizing and celebrating your individuality. Furthermore, she states that **you can cultivate your sense of individuality by being creative.** Paint, draw, sew, invent new recipes, sculpt, write: Do anything that indulges your creative side.

**According to Brown, being creative cultivates individuality because it involves producing something original using your unique skills.** Nobody else has the same creative skillset as you or expresses their creativity in the same way as you. Therefore, your creative talents represent a part of you that’s individual and incomparable.

> **The Benefits of Creativity**
> 
> Creativity isn’t just beneficial to your sense of individuality. Research has shown that being creative can improve your mental and physical health in various other ways, too. For instance, a 2010 review of the existing literature on creativity’s health benefits found that [being creative has beneficial effects like](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804629/):
> 
> - Helping people to process trauma
>     
> - Reducing anxiety
>     
> - Enabling people to express difficult thoughts and emotions
>     
> - Reducing stress and compassion fatigue among carers
>     
> 
> Other research has suggested that creativity can [improve the emotional wellbeing of dementia patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16439826/) and [assist with chronic pain management](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10865-008-9149-4). One study even found that [being creative can increase the CD4+ lymphocyte count of HIV patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15039514/)—in effect, strengthening their immune systems.
> 
> While researchers are still unclear on _why_ creativity can have such potent health benefits, the evidence suggests that a link between creativity and improved health at least exists.

### Use Intuition

An important part of being yourself is **trusting, valuing, and using your intuition—your unique and individual gut feeling—when making decisions.** This is Brown’s next strategy for living Wholeheartedly.

According to Brown—who bases her view on the work of psychologists [David G. Myers](http://www.davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=1) and [Gerd Gigerenzer](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/gerd-gigerenzer)—when you use intuition, your brain uses information from your past experiences to quickly and unconsciously attach meaning to something you’ve just observed. **The meaning that your brain decides upon when using intuition becomes your “gut feeling” about the situation.**

For example, imagine you observe someone being rude to your friend. Your mind will quickly scan through all of the information it has relating to rudeness and acceptable standards of behavior. In the past, you’ve learned that rudeness is hurtful to its target and generally socially unacceptable. Based on this information, your brain will attach the following gut feeling to the situation: that your friend is being mistreated, and that you should support them.

(Shortform note: When discussing what intuition is and how it works, Brown doesn’t explicitly state how using intuition will bolster your worthiness (thus allowing you to live Wholeheartedly). However, we might infer that **trusting your intuition, and believing that you can use it to make good decisions, will increase your feeling of worthiness.** Instinctive decision-making will become an area in which you feel you’re “good enough.”)

#### Barriers to Using Intuition

Using your intuition may seem like a straightforward process. After all, you’re probably already doing it unconsciously and automatically. **However, as Brown notes, many of us struggle to use intuition successfully.** She argues that often, this is because we’re wary of accepting our gut feelings.

**According to Brown, this wariness comes from a combination of a lack of trust in our own judgment and the brain’s overwhelming need for certainty.** Because we don’t trust ourselves to intuitively make the “correct” decision, we don’t feel certain that our gut feeling is right. Instinctively, humans hate uncertainty—and that hatred makes us reject the “uncertain” gut feeling.

How can we learn to overcome our fear of uncertainty (and, consequently, become comfortable with following our intuition)? Brown suggests **embracing** **faith.** She doesn’t necessarily mean embracing _religious_ faith; more, embracing the belief that things _will work out_, even if you can’t be _certain_ that they will. Faith requires you to bravely let go of your fear of uncertainty and decide that even though you can’t be sure what’s ahead, you’re going to move forward and act anyway.

(Shortform note: Brown doesn’t explore in detail the link between embracing faith and embracing intuition. One theory is that having faith helps you to use intuition because **you become willing to act on your gut feeling, despite the risk that it’s wrong, because you have faith that it might be right.)**

> **Should We _Always_ Follow Our Intuition?**
> 
> Is intuition _always_ a useful process, and should we _always_ have faith in our gut feelings? Perhaps not: As Malcolm Gladwell notes in _[Blink](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink)_, **the process of intuiting isn’t perfect, and it may not always lead to “correct” judgments.**
> 
> (Note that Gladwell refers to intuition as “unconscious thinking,” a term we’ll also use when discussing his work. Brown’s definition of intuition fits neatly with Gladwell’s concept of unconscious thinking: Both authors view this type of thinking as a powerful process that can lead us to make good decisions quickly, without realizing we’re doing it.)
> 
> As Gladwell explains, sometimes, if we’re under stress, pressed for time, or have strong biases, [our unconscious thinking can malfunction.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink/chapter-3) **The brain may make a faulty snap judgment that’s based on irrelevant, incorrect, or superficial information,** rather than on the full breadth of the information available to it.
> 
> For instance, imagine a person has an ingrained unconscious bias that female medical professionals are usually nurses, not doctors ([a bias that exists](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/female-physicians-often-assumed-be-nurses-patient-survey-finds), according to some research). If this person seeks treatment at a health facility and is greeted by a female clinician, their bias may overwhelm their unconscious thinking, leading them to intuitively believe that the clinician is a nurse, not a doctor, and greet them as such. If their unconscious mind had looked deeper at the situation, it may have noticed that the clinician wore a name tag identifying her as a doctor. **However, overwhelmed by bias, it failed to do so, leading to the faulty snap judgment.**
> 
> This flaw of intuition doesn’t necessarily mean that we should have _no_ faith in it, however: Our intuition does frequently get it right. Furthermore, as Gladwell notes, **there are steps you can take to reduce the likelihood of unconscious thinking going wrong.** One approach he suggests is to [try to overcome the unconscious biases that sway your intuition in the wrong direction.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink/chapter-3) You can do this by repeatedly exposing yourself to people or situations that challenge that bias. For instance, the person in the example above might try to always see female doctors rather than male ones. This will help their brain grow accustomed to the idea that women can be doctors as well as nurses, thus reducing their bias.
