## Chapter 8: Relationship Management

The second step to social competence and the fourth and final skill in EQ development is relationship management. **Relationship management is your ability to develop relationships with other people.**

People with high levels of relationship management:

- Connect with a multitude of people
- Interact with people frequently
- Find the benefits in every relationship
- Create an environment that promotes discussion and connection
- Handle stressful situations well
- Develop a strong rapport with coworkers—even with people they do not inherently agree with

### 16 Tactics to Develop Relationship Management

#### Embrace Openness

**Tactic #1: Be open and take an interest.** Explain your background and share some personal information. When you willingly share things about yourself, it minimizes opportunities for others to misinterpret your behaviors.

> For example, you like to keep your desk pristine and in order. If anything is out of place, you get upset. Without explanation, people may interpret this as uptight and overbearing. However, if you explain that you spent time in the military where order became a part of your routine, it gives context to your behavior and allows your coworkers to better understand your perspective.

In addition to sharing information about your own life, take an interest in the lives of others. This helps you understand their choices and ensures that you don’t misinterpret _their_ behaviors. Be curious, not judgmental:

- Don’t: “You have a degree in music? Why?”
- Do: “You have a degree in music? I didn’t know that! Could you tell me more about it?”

**Tactic #2: Be accessible.** People need to feel comfortable approaching you. To do this, adopt an “open-door” policy. This allows colleagues to come in and have unscheduled conversations in which they can address issues, discuss projects, or seek guidance.

You don’t need to support everyone all of the time. Be clear about _your_ version of the “open-door” policy and stick to it. People will feel more appreciated because you’re willing to give them your time. Also, this gives you an opportunity to learn more about the people that you work with, strengthening your relationships and helping you navigate your workplace culture.

**Tactic #3: Embrace feedback.** Having someone point out errors or areas of improvement can lead to intense emotional responses. You may feel put on the spot or called out. However, feedback is essential to development and requires that you hear it without letting your emotions get in the way. To enhance your ability to take feedback:

- **Think about the purpose.** The person bringing you feedback is probably not coming from a place of malice. They’re likely trying to help you by expressing their observations and suggestions.
- **Listen.** You may feel the urge to get defensive. Take a step back and really hear what the person has to say. Ask questions for clarification.
- **Show gratitude.** Giving feedback is just as challenging as getting it. It requires thoughtfulness and attentiveness. Appreciate the time that the person took to speak with you, even if you don’t agree with the feedback.
- **Take your time**. Often, trying to make changes immediately doesn’t give you time to absorb and understand the feedback you were given. Sort out your emotions and thoughts, then move forward.
- **Value the feedback.** Though you may not agree with the suggestions, take all feedback seriously. Try to implement what you can. You may find that something you didn’t think would work actually makes your life easier.

**Tactic #4: Develop trust.** Trust is difficult to develop but easy to lose. Practice patience and consistently do what you say you’re going to do to create bonds with the people around you. To begin building trust:

- **Promote open communication.** Share something about yourself and encourage others to do the same. You don’t need to lay your entire life out for all to see, but showing a little vulnerability helps people feel comfortable trusting you with their personal information.
- **Be reliable.** If you consistently deliver, people will begin to trust that you’ll do what you say you’re going to do.
- **Use your self-awareness.** Identify relationships that lack trust and figure out what’s missing. If you can figure out why the trust isn’t there, you can start to take actions to fix it.
- **Use your social awareness.** Ask people what you can do to earn their trust. This shows that you genuinely want to bolster the relationship, which automatically begins to build trust.

#### Be Clear

**Tactic #5: Improve your communication style.** Your natural style of communication dictates how others perceive you. If the way you talk doesn’t reflect your intentions, others may not understand what you’re trying to communicate and may develop negative feelings towards you. To better understand the way you communicate and the ways you can improve:

- **Identify your current style.** Describe it yourself, then ask friends, family, and/or colleagues to describe it. This keeps you accountable and removes a biased personal opinion from the equation.
- **List the upsides and downsides of the way you communicate.** For example, if you tend to take charge of conversations, an upside may be that you keep things on task, but a downside may be that you shut down other people.
- From your list of downsides, focus on two or three and figure out how you can adjust for them. You can try to eliminate them, but, if you can’t, find ways you can reduce their impact.

**Tactic #6: Avoid mixed messages.** They confuse and frustrate people. When you're communicating, make sure the way you speak and your body language match what you’re trying to say. If you’re telling an employee that you’re excited to have them on a project, but do so with slouched shoulders and a disinterested tone, they probably won’t trust that you’re actually excited.

Everyone has emotions rise to the surface—even people with great self-management skills. In those moments, try to put negative emotions aside until you have the opportunity to express them fully and in an environment that they won’t have a negative impact. You will need to work through your emotions eventually, but, if you let your emotions disrupt the message you’re trying to send, it will give off mixed messages. If you cannot put your emotions aside, be honest. Explain what’s happening and what you’re feeling.

> For instance, one of your teams successfully launched a project, and you’ve taken them out to dinner to celebrate. While at dinner, you get a phone call from a colleague. They tell you that a different department failed to close a deal that they’ve been working on for months. At that moment, you may feel frustration come to the surface, but you decide it’s not worth destroying the morale of the team you’re at dinner with.
> 
> You tell your colleague that you’ll call her after you’ve finished with dinner to figure out a solution. You return to dinner and say, “If I seem frustrated, it’s because we were supposed to close that deal today, and it didn’t happen. It has nothing to do with you guys. I genuinely appreciate the work that you’ve all done.” You and your team enjoy the rest of your dinner, then you deal with your frustration when the time is right.

**Tactic #7: Explain your choices.** People fear what they don’t understand. If you leave people in the dark, they may not know why you’ve made a choice, leading to frustration and/or anxiety. When explaining your decisions, acknowledge any alternative routes, show your thought process, then explain the ways your decision will impact everyone.

> For example, you’re putting together a team to work on an assignment. You know that Anita is best suited for a position on the team, but you have another project in mind for her, so you put Susan on the team instead. You never explain your decision to Anita. Two weeks later, Anita comes into your office and explains that she’s upset. She knows that she should have been on that team and doesn’t understand why you passed on her. Because you never explained the reason behind your decision, Anita became frustrated and demoralized. Had you taken a moment to pull her aside and explain why you made the choice you did, she may not have been as irritated.

#### Show Respect

**Tactic #8: Make sure your intention matches your impact.** If you mistime comments or fail to note the emotional state of your colleagues, your good intentions may end with unintended consequences. Respect the emotions of those around you and assess situations before you act.

> For instance, you’re a manager at a local restaurant. You decide that you want to lead by example and begin to take on more projects around the restaurant. Your intention is to be a role model that others can look to and take inspiration from. However, in your efforts to work hard, you fail to notice that you’re stepping on the toes of your colleagues—micro-managing them and speaking in a derogatory manner. Though you had the best of intentions, your colleagues now think you’re controlling and overbearing.

**Tactic #9: Respect the emotions of others.** If you try to negate or ignore what they’re feeling, they won’t respond well. Use your listening skills, ask what you can do to help, and be empathetic. This validates the feelings of the other person without exaggerating or exacerbating their emotional state.

> For example, you’re walking into the office when you notice John sitting in his car with his head on the steering wheel. You knock on his window. He rolls it down, and you ask if he’s okay. He says that he’s going through a rough time right now. Instead of saying, “Well, we all have bad days. See you inside,” you acknowledge his emotions by saying, “I’m sorry you’re having a rough time. Is there anything I can do to help you?” He says that he’ll be fine, but he appreciates you taking a moment to check in.

**Tactic #10: Use common courtesies.** Say “please,” “thank you,” and “I’m sorry.” These phrases will help you raise morale and connect to your colleagues through mutual respect and appreciation. These may seem trivial, but they send constant reminders of consideration to the people you’re around.

**Tactic #11: Show your appreciation.** Little signals of appreciation can go a long way. When someone does good work, praise them. When they go the extra mile, acknowledge it. Even if it’s something as small as buying someone lunch or leaving a thank you note, small gestures let the people around you know that you see the work that they’re doing and that you appreciate it.

#### Handle Tense Situations Effectively

**Tactic #12: Only use anger intentionally.** When anger comes out as an emotional response, you may come across as out-of-control. However, if you use it as a tactic, it can effectively send a message. Only use your anger as a tactic when you feel like you have a masterful handle on your emotions:

- Determine the degrees of your anger. You respond to something that annoys you differently than something that infuriates you.
- Only use your anger when it can improve the situation. Sometimes, anger can motivate people to perform better. Other times, anger demoralizes everyone and destroys efficiency. Assess the situation before you use your frustration.

> For instance, you’re the coach of a basketball team. Your team is in the championship, and you’re getting beaten badly. At halftime, you get your team together in the locker room and let them know that they're not doing their jobs. You tell them to pull it together and remind them of the importance of this game. Your frustration helps motivate them to improve their performance and win.

**Tactic #13: Respond appropriately.** Read the situation, watch for signals that indicate the emotional state of the person speaking to you, and respond in a way that respects their feelings.This allows you to help people effectively while keeping them calm and rational. Don’t necessarily mirror the other person’s emotions. Especially in high-tension situations, this will make the tone of the conversation even worse.

> For instance, you’re working in customer service. An annoyed customer throws a broken item on the counter and angrily demands an immediate replacement as she needs it for an event. Rather than reflect her rude demeanor, you apologize for the product not working and tell her that you will work to get her that replacement as quickly as possible. The customer appreciates that you’re taking her claim seriously and begins to calm down.

**Tactic #14: Use “fix-it” statements.** When things start getting intense, avoid pointing fingers and focus on fixing the problem. “Fix-it” statements are neutral statements that refocus everyone’s attention towards the problem at hand. These statements can be direct solutions to the issue or acknowledgments such as “this is challenging.” They alleviate some of the tension and keep things from getting personal.

> For example, you and Anthony are in the middle of a fight. You’ve been painting a mural for a local business. Due to a miscommunication, Anthony put something on the mural that he wasn’t supposed to, costing you both hours of work. As tensions rise, you take a step back and breathe. After a moment, you say, “This is going to be hard, but we’ll get through it.” You then gently explain the way that you can fix the problem. Though you're still frustrated, the conversation calmed down before it could escalate any further or permanently damage your relationship with Anthony.

**Tactic #15: Don’t put off the unavoidable.** Sometimes, unavoidable scenarios arise that you aren’t entirely comfortable with. You may have to work on a project that you don’t enjoy or work with a teammate that you don’t care for. In these situations, develop strategies to approach your work effectively while keeping your emotions in check.

When the scenario involves another person, be polite but direct. You don’t need to tell them that you dislike them, but you do need to figure out a way you can work together without too much hostility. Though it may force you to hold your tongue a bit, use your EQ skills to adapt to the person:

- Watch for signals of their emotional state and navigate the conversation accordingly.
- Try to read _their_ perspective of _you_. They may not want to work with you either, and, while that may sting a bit, it’s important information to note when trying to navigate a difficult working relationship.

> For example, you and Zach work in the same advertising department. You can’t stand one another and typically avoid working together when possible. However, your boss has just assigned you two to the same project during which you will spend significant amounts of time around one another. Instead of dreading the work and letting your anxiety and frustration grow, you ask Zach to grab lunch with you so you can strategize for the project. At lunch, you politely suggest that you work separately on different parts of the project and meet once a day to discuss progress. Zach agrees, and you figure out a plan-of-attack.

**Tactic #16: Give effective feedback.** Effective feedback requires the use of all four EQ skills, and shows how the EQ progression works.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Step #**|**EQ Skill**|**How to Use That Skill**|
|**Step 1**|Self-Awareness|How do you feel about the feedback you have to give? Note your emotional responses to the information that you’re sharing. If you’re uncomfortable or anxious, try to find the reason behind those emotions.|
|**Step 2**|Self-Management|Regardless of how you feel, keep your emotions in check when delivering feedback. Use the information you gathered from your self-awareness to create tactics to keep yourself calm and on task.|
|**Step 3**|Social Awareness|Once you have a handle on your own emotions, think about how this feedback may affect the person in front of you. Consider their personality and current emotional state.|
|**Step 4**|Relationship Management|Finally, once you consider the feelings of the other person, come up with a plan. Feedback requires that you give your opinion then offer solutions. Think about the most effective way to deliver this information effectively without demoralizing or infuriating the other person.|

> For example, you need to talk with Laura about her tone on the phone with clients. Multiple people have said that she’s been short and rude, and it’s cost you business.
> 
> - First, you assess how you’re feeling about the situation. You’re frustrated because her behavior isn’t acceptable. However, you’re triggered by poor behavior with clients, so your annoyance may come from your history with bad coworkers.
>     
> - Next, you think about how you’re going to manage your feelings. You tell yourself that you’re going to keep calm and avoid allowing your frustration to speak for you. You commit to focusing on your breath and counting to ten if you feel your emotions coming to the surface.
>     
> - Next, you think about Laura. You’ve noticed that her demeanor has changed recently, and you’ve heard that she’s going through some issues at home. You know that she’s typically kind and hard-working but can be fragile and defensive at times.
>     
> - Finally, you make a plan. You know that you’re frustrated and want to talk in an environment where you can sit down and take your time with the conversation, so you schedule a one-on-one meeting with Laura. You recognize her potential fragility, and you don’t want to intimidate her, so you decide to hold the meeting in a neutral place like a conference room. Also, you know that she’s going through a hard time, so you decide that you’re going to start the conversation by asking her if she’s okay. If something outside of the office is causing her attitude, this may help you understand her behavior and figure out how to get her back on track.
>     

**Tactic #17: Effectively navigate difficult conversations.** Remain calm, show your empathy, and speak clearly:

- **Start on common ground.** When you see a disagreement on the horizon, start the conversation by discussing a shared goal or perspective. This connects you to the other person and shows that, even if you disagree for the rest of the conversation, you agree on something.
- **Ask the other person to explain their perspective.** Give the person an opportunity to express how they’re feeling and their opinion on the situation. This makes them feel heard and appreciated.
- **Try not to plan rebuttals.** Listen attentively to the other person. If you’re planning comebacks in your head, you’re not actually hearing the other person.
- **Explain your side to the person.** Thoughtfully explain the reasoning behind decisions that you’ve made and your perspective on the situation. Think about the other person’s emotions, and clarify your position tactfully.
- **Keep the conversation moving.** Once you understand the perspective of the other person and vice versa, move the conversation towards resolution. If you allow the conversation to stay in disagreement for too long, hostility can grow.
- **Stay in touch.** Wounds from tough conversations may take some time to heal. Check in frequently and develop a plan to reestablish trust and remind the other person that you value them.
