## Chapter 1: Feeling Trapped by Unworthiness

**Radical Acceptance is a meditative practice that acknowledges what we’re experiencing—positive or negative—and welcomes it.** It’s a powerful tool that allows us to be fully present in each passing moment. It helps us avoid getting stuck in our own heads. Tara Brach, a practicing psychologist and devout Buddhist, discusses how we can use Radical Acceptance to live our lives more fully, by always bringing our full attention to the present moment and accepting it for what it is.

In _Radical Acceptance_ we’ll discuss:

- How and why we get trapped in the stories we tell ourselves about our unworthiness (Chapter 1)
- How Radical Acceptance can help bring us out of that trance (Chapter 2)
- Various ways of practicing Radical Acceptance in our lives and relationships (Chapters 3-11)
- The final step: using Radical Acceptance to let go of ego (Chapter 12)

Many people—perhaps even most people—struggle with feelings of unworthiness. They never feel as if they’re good enough, or smart enough, or successful enough, or whatever the focus of their insecurity is. In their attempts to become “better,” people constantly observe and judge themselves. They are always on the lookout for imperfections in themselves and, when they inevitably find some, it just drives them deeper into their sense of inadequacy.

These feelings drive people to all kinds of self-destructive behavior, most notably addiction in all its various forms. Whether the addiction is to drugs, sex, work—an addiction that is, unfortunately, applauded by Western culture—or something else, it often stems from an attempt to escape the feelings of worthlessness.

They also create feelings of isolation. People who don’t think that they’re good enough will assume that others think the same. They’ll find it hard to trust people who offer them love, friendship, or even simple encouragement.

The tragic irony is that people are always trying to go somewhere else, do something else, _be_ someone else; but we all reach the same inescapable end. Where do we think we’re going?

### The Source of Unworthiness

To illustrate how we come to have these unworthy feelings, Brach shares an anecdote about her time at an _ashram_—a small religious and spiritual community. She struggled with feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing, and hoped that she could alleviate them through spiritual growth.

It worked to some extent. After a lengthy session of meditation and yoga, she would feel whole and at peace. However, as the day went on, feelings of self-doubt and judgement would creep in. She wanted others to admire her spirituality, and felt guilty for having those desires. At the same time, she judged some other members of her ashram for what she saw as their deficient spirituality, and felt guilty for _those_ thoughts.

**She eventually came to realize that, at the most basic level, she was still trying to do the same thing as always:** She was trying to find peace and self-acceptance by changing or improving herself. That was why, no matter how deeply she meditated or how proficient she became at yoga, those feelings were doomed to always come back.

Consider the foundational myth of much of Western culture: Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Most of us have heard it so many times that it’s become banal, but take a moment to really think about the message of it. The story of Eden teaches us humans are inherently bad, and we need to cleanse ourselves of sin before we’re worthy of happiness. Moreover, the way we cleanse ourselves is supposed to be through strict control: Control of our thoughts, our emotions, our natural urges, other people, and even the world around us.

#### Childhood Unworthiness

Western culture breeds and nourishes unhealthy, self-loathing thoughts. From childhood we’re constantly set in competition against each other, forced to prove endlessly that we’re smart enough, skilled enough, “cool” enough to be worthy of attention and praise. Every human connection—with family, friends, or teachers—has to be earned, and there’s always someone watching to see if we’re living up to expectations.

There’s a short anecdote about a family in a restaurant: a mother and father, and their five-year-old daughter. When the waitress comes to take orders, the daughter asks for a hot dog. The father immediately interrupts and says that she’ll have the meatloaf instead. The waitress, completely ignoring the interruption, asks the girl what she’d like on her hot dog. The parents are stunned, but the girl comments with amazement, “She thinks I’m real.”

This story gets to the heart of a lot of the insecurities people grow up with. Many of them stem from a culture that treats children as if they’re not real people, with their own thoughts and feelings. Instead, imperfect parents—carrying on lessons from their own imperfect parents—see their children through the lenses of their own desires and fears. What if the child doesn’t get into a good college? What if she acts out and reflects badly on her parents? They try to drive the child’s life the way they wish they’d driven their own lives, never thinking to ask the child what he or she wants.

In abusive homes this is taken to the extreme, where children are told that they’re in the way, that they’re annoying, that they’re worthless drains on the parents’ time and energy. However, even in healthier situations, children are often taught to be quiet and obedient, and to parrot what their parents think or want to hear.

In short, Western families—often unintentionally—continue the story of the Garden of Eden. Each new generation is brought up thinking that they’re inherently, fundamentally flawed, and that they have to fix those flaws in order to get back into the Garden.

#### Unhealthy Strategies to Cope With Unworthiness

Naturally, people seek out ways to cope with or cover up the feelings of unworthiness or inadequacy, like Adam and Eve trying to hide their nakedness from God. Over time, each of us comes up with our own personal mix of coping mechanisms to hide our imperfections and make up for what we believe to be wrong with us. Here are a few examples.

- **We constantly undertake self-improvement projects.** Whether it’s trying the newest weight-loss program, taking workshops, or angling for a promotion at work, we’re always trying to improve in some way. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with that in itself, but all too often this quest for self-improvement is driven by the anxiety that we’re not _good enough_, whatever that means to us.
- **We avoid risks.** Everyone knows that failing—at a work project, a new hobby, or a hoped-for relationship—is painful and embarrassing. We want to be instantly good at what we do and to succeed at everything. It’s a natural feeling, but taken to the extreme that fear holds us back from expressing ourselves, from seeking out responsibility or leadership roles, or even just from trying new things.
- **We hide from our own experience**. We have a running narrative about our lives that we use to separate ourselves from whatever raw emotions we may be feeling in the moment. The narrative is bound to have certain running themes: what we have done and still need to do, how others see us, how others have helped us or let us down. Constantly thinking about the past and worrying about the future gives us a false sense of control, while robbing us of the experience of actually living.
- **We stay busy.** Burying ourselves in work is a socially acceptable way to avoid pain. “I’m keeping busy” is an all-too-common response when we ask how someone in mourning is doing. If we ever slow down, we risk having our pain and our feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness catch up. As soon as there’s any break in the work we immediately turn to our phones, our televisions, food, music, anything to keep our own psyche at bay for a while longer.
- **We criticize ourselves.** We search for—and find—every flaw we have and every mistake we make. It gives us a false sense that we’re controlling our urges, hiding our weaknesses, and perhaps improving ourselves. However, the endless self-reproach does more harm than good.
- **We criticize others.** By blaming and judging others, we remove some of the pressure from ourselves. Instead of making ourselves the enemy, the enemy could be a parent who didn’t respect us, or a political group who takes away our rights. There are, of course, genuine threats in the world that need to be dealt with accordingly. However, if we simply lash out and attack these external evils, it causes harm in much the same way as attacking ourselves; it strengthens the harmful thought patterns and the damaging responses to them.

Most of these coping mechanisms are rooted in the assumption that there’s something fundamentally wrong with us. Every time we recognize and hide from our own sense of inadequacy, we’re strengthening the neural pathways that cause that feeling in the first place. Even the last one, which assumes that there’s something wrong with others instead of ourselves, perpetuates the harmful pattern. **In short, by trying to avoid the pain, we’re only making it worse.**

### Anxiety Stems From Selfishness

Legend has it that the Buddha attained enlightenment while meditating under the Bodhi tree. While he would go on to teach many lessons about spirituality and religion, his teachings all begin with what is called the first noble truth: Suffering is universal, and understanding it is the first step toward enlightenment.

During his meditation, the Buddha examined his own suffering and discovered that it came from the false belief that he was a distinct person, separate and apart from the universe. **This sense of “selfness” had him trapped in endless cycles of desire and aversion.** He—like all people—was fruitlessly chasing what he thought he wanted, and running from what he perceived as painful or unwelcome.

This sense of individuality goes back to the very earliest forms of life: single-celled organisms whose membranes created barriers between them and the rest of the world. This was the beginning of _dualism_, the belief that your own self is separate from the world around you. Desires and aversions are also part of evolution, millions of years’ worth of history guiding us toward what will help us and away from what will hurt us.

However, when those wants and fears become the core of how we see ourselves, we lose our larger identities. When we perceive our experiences through a lens of “I” and “mine,” the universal suffering becomes personal; the sense that “something is wrong” becomes “something is wrong _with me_.”

**It may help to understand what the self truly is: It’s nothing but a collection of our most habitual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.** Consciousness is the mind telling itself a story about what it’s experiencing. Isolating yourself, believing that you are somehow different and distinct from what’s around you, separates you from the world and leaves you insecure, needy, and afraid. It disconnects you from the love that unites all living things, your deepest, truest self—what the Dalai Lama calls your “Buddha nature.”

The Buddha taught a lesson that’s in sharp contrast with Western ideas of sin: **Being born human is a precious gift.** It’s a chance to recognize the love and awareness that is the true nature of every creature. Or, as the Dalai Lama once said, “We all have Buddha nature.” In other words, people are inherently good, not bad. We don’t need to constantly strive to prove and improve ourselves.

We are good enough.

#### Let Go of Perfection

**The Zen master Seng-tsan said that to be free is to live without worrying about imperfection**. Imperfections—in yourself or in the world—don’t mean that there’s something wrong with you. They’re a natural and inescapable part of existence. Therefore, it’s much better to accept yourself, others, and life as they are, rather than chasing some impossible dream of how they should be.

By becoming so focused on ourselves, and chasing what we think we want, we cut ourselves off from the things that fulfill our greatest needs: Those things that keep us connected and reaffirm our natural goodness, our Buddha nature. Our greatest needs are met when we relate to each other, when we are fully present in every moment instead of worrying about the past or future, and when we accept and revel in the beauty—and the pain—that’s always around us.

Decenter yourself. **Remember that it’s not all about you; it just _is_.** This is the key to Radical Acceptance.
