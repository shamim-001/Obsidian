## Chapter 1: The Future Before Me

I didn’t want to be a doctor. I didn’t know what I wanted to be. Maybe a writer, but the time when I’d have to decide on a career was far off. I was getting ready to leave for college in less than a month, and the only thing I was concerned about was how much I couldn’t wait to leave my small community in Arizona and enter the shiny world beyond it.

Plus, so many people in my family were doctors, including my uncle and father. From what I knew about it, medicine seemed to equate to long hours and time away from your family.

My father had moved my two brothers, my mother, and me from Bronxville, New York, a picturesque community north of the city, to Kingman, Arizona several years earlier. Kingman wasn’t on anyone’s radar except for as a place to pass through. The desert town was walled in by two mountain ranges. My father had loved the weather, the more reasonable prices, and the opportunity to build his own medical practice.

How he’d convinced my mother to move there was a mystery. A Hindu from southern India, she was deathly afraid of snakes, which were prevalent in the Arizona desert, among other creatures. My friends and I ran freely, roaming the expansive land in search of treasures. Compared to our previous buttoned-up, quaint, Norman Rockwell community, I was enchanted with the unruly terrain.

My father still worked often. He was something of a passing mirage, appearing in the evenings and on the weekends to provide whatever combination of affection and edicts he could fit in that amount of time.

My mother, on the other hand, became ingrained in our educational upbringing. She feared the lack of opportunities a school district like Kingman could offer her sons. She was well-educated, having trained to be a physiologist before marrying my father. But her knowledge of books was scarce, and she was determined to change that in our lives.

She dug up a list of recommended reading for prospective college students. She made sure we read each one on the list. At ten, I read _1984_ by George Orwell, which helped curate my love for words. My brother, Suman, at college by the time I was twelve, also gave me the books he’d been reading. _Brave New World_ instilled in me my moral compass. I would later write about it on my college applications, denouncing the popular belief that we only live to find happiness.

These books enriched my mind and became my guide for how to understand life.

Making sure we were well-read wasn’t the end of my mother’s pursuits. She became part of the school administration, organized the teaching staff, lobbied for advanced classes to be provided. She was a one-woman construction crew, and she reconstructed the Kingman school district into a place where the students started to feel like they had a chance. To ensure our chance at success, she drove us to Las Vegas a hundred miles away to take our placement tests.

### A Spark of Destiny that Grows to a Flame

The summer before I left for Stanford, my girlfriend at the time gave me a book, _Satan: His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, J.S.P.S._ by Jeremy Levin. It wasn’t like the rest of the books I’d read. It was about the brain and how the mind was strictly a mechanical function of it. This idea changed me. My love of literature was partly due to the way it cut to the core of human meaning. If the brain was responsible for operating this sense of meaning, I wanted to learn more about it. To my upcoming college courses in literature, I added biology and neuroscience.

My time at Stanford wasn’t geared toward figuring out a career path. What motivated me during those first years of college was a desire to understand the aspects of life that made it meaningful. I was working toward degrees in English and Biology, but I still felt literature was superior in illuminating the mind.

I had come to determine that meaning was intertwined with morality and human connection. Through literature, including the likes of T.S. Eliot, Elio, Nabokov, and Conrad, I learned about human suffering, isolation, despondency, and the fallibility of language and ensuing consequences. I became privy to the experiences of others and to the need to reflect on my reaction to them. Literature created a landscape for moral examination and for the expression of true life. But studying life is not the same as living life, and I was often conflicted between the academic work and the desire to put that work to practice by forming relationships. How could a life have meaning if it is not directly experienced in the flesh?

I was forced to answer that question during the summer between sophomore and junior years. I had the choice of working at a scientific research center in Atlanta or as a cook at a summer camp in the Eldorado National Forest. It was a choice between filling my brain with theories about meaning or filling my life with meaningful experiences. I chose the camp.

On my way there, I tried to discern if I’d made the wrong choice, but after arriving, I realized everything I wanted the camp to be was a reality. The scenery, the people, the connections and experiences---they were all beautiful. Standing on top of a mountain at sunrise, I saw the juxtaposition of light as the world woke up on one side and the darkness of the world still asleep on the other. It was a miraculous moment, one that makes you realize just how small you are amidst the whole of the universe.

### A New Lens for Life

Life was different once I got back to school, more enriching. I spent the next two years continuing my education of the relationship between the mind and meaning. Literature and philosophy offered in-depth exploration of the significance of life, and neuroscience helped me continue to examine how the brain related to that significance. All of this was happening while I forged deep friendships and curated deep life experiences.

It was during senior year when my neuroscience class took a trip to a facility that housed people with traumatic brain injuries. As soon as we entered, a visceral wailing met us. I looked around until I saw the source of the sound---a young woman curled up on the floor in the middle of an agonizing episode. I quickly recognized that we were the only non-residents in the place. When I inquired why, I was horrified to find out that many of the families of the residents had stopped visiting as frequently or at all.

I expected my professor to understand my disillusionment about the abandonment of these kids. After all, the crying girl had smiled at me. Didn’t she deserve people who cared about her? Imagine my surprise when this teacher, a person I knew to ponder how science and morality came together, said sometimes it’s better if patients like that don’t survive. I was livid and stormed out. But later, after thinking about it, I realized that experience had changed something in me. The brain houses our ability to relate and connect and make meaning of life. When the brain fails, we lose those things. I wondered: when those things are lost, is life worth living?

### Who Will I Become?

I couldn’t shake the feeling, as I got closer to graduation, that there was still more I wanted to learn. I decided to enroll in graduate school to continue my education on how literature relates to meaning. I was going after a master’s degree in English literature at Stanford.

I understood that language created our sense of significance and integrity. Language created bonds between people. From these ideas, I came to understand that human relationality was what engendered meaning. I started to consider that the brain was not solely representative of this process. The whole body was inextricably involved somehow.

A professor of mine, Richard Rorty, a masterful philosopher, helped me see that every discipline had a part in creating language that would serve as the function of knowing the meaning in life. I began to follow the work of Walt Whitman in his search to uncover the concept of “the Physiological-Spiritual Man.” I based my thesis on this work, but, like Whitman, I couldn’t concretely discern the proper words, or language, that adequately described this state of being.

I also discovered that literature, in the way it sharply deviates from science, was not to be the focus of my continued studies. Despite the positive response to my thesis, I’d included as much rumination on neuroscience and psychiatry as literature. I knew it was beyond the scope of the standard English department ideology. And so was I.
