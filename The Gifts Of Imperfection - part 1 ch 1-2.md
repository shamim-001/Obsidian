## Part 1: The Theory of Worthiness | Chapters 1-2: Defining Worthiness

In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brené Brown explores “Wholehearted living”: a concept she devised after years of research into shame, vulnerability, and self-worth. Wholehearted living has many aspects and nuances, but we can succinctly understand it as **a way of life that cultivates a feeling of worthiness.**

In this first part of the guide, we’ll explore the theory behind worthiness, including the factors that promote and undermine it. In this chapter, we’ll define worthiness more concretely, covering the key principles that underpin it and how you can cultivate it.

### Defining Worthiness

According to Brown, worthiness is **the conviction that you are good enough as you are, flaws and all, and that you deserve to be loved.** In simpler terms, we might conceive it as **having high self-esteem.**

Brown develops the idea of worthiness organically through anecdotes, advice on how to feel worthy, and descriptions of love and belonging, and it can be hard to pull out the main ideas about worthiness. We’ve synthesized the four key principles that seem to underpin her idea of worthiness:

**Principle #1: Accept yourself unconditionally.** Don’t set prerequisites for being worthy—for example, “I’ll be good enough once I’ve paid off all my debts” or “I’ll be good enough once I’ve got a college degree.” You don’t need to meet these arbitrary requirements to be worthy because you’re enough _as you are, today_.

**Principle #2:** **Abandon the idea that to be “enough,” you need to fit societal standards or other people’s expectations.** You’re worthy as you are, no matter how well you “fit in” or what anyone else thinks.

**Principle #3: Reject the notion that you need to earn self-worth by proving yourself or pleasing others.** Your worthiness isn’t rooted in your actions—for example, succeeding at work or making lots of friends. _Who you are_, not _what you do_, is at the center of your worth.

**Principle #4: Believe that you deserve love and belonging.** During her research, Brown found that it’s impossible to fully experience love or belonging until you’ve cultivated worthiness. People with a lack of self-worth often believe that they don’t _deserve_ to belong or receive love, and when we feel we don’t deserve something, we reject it.

> **The Low Self-Esteem Epidemic**
> 
> In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown acknowledges that many of us struggle to see our worthiness. **But _why_ do so many of us have low self-esteem?**
> 
> Many writers and researchers have attempted to answer this question. For instance, in his seminal work _[12 Rules for Life](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life)_, Jordan Peterson approaches low self-esteem from an ethical angle. He argues that since humanity has repeatedly revealed its propensity for evil—for instance, through atrocities such as the Holocaust—[it’s become much easier for us to hate both humanity as a whole and ourselves](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life/rule-2) (presumably for being part of the fundamentally “evil” human race).
> 
> Meanwhile, writer and speaker Rachel Hollis writes in her book _[Girl, Wash Your Face](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/girl-wash-your-face)_ that [low self-worth is often a result of childhood trauma](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/girl-wash-your-face/lie-3). [Psychological research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020764019894618) supports this theory. Childhood trauma is widespread—the US government’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports that, by age 16, [almost 70% of young people have experienced some form of trauma](https://www.samhsa.gov/child-trauma/understanding-child-trauma). Therefore, it’s no wonder that so many adults have low self-esteem.
> 
> The good news is that, whatever its cause, low self-esteem—or, as Brown may frame it, a lack of worthiness—_can_ be improved, as she discusses next.

### Cultivating Worthiness

So, we’ve learned what worthiness is, according to Brown. The next question is, _how can we cultivate worthiness_? Brown’s research suggests that there are three values that you need to practice to increase your sense of worthiness: **courage,** **compassion,** and **connection**.

#### Courage

By courage, Brown doesn’t mean the kind of courage you use during an act of heroism, such as the courage you show when you run into a burning building to save a child. Instead, she means **ordinary courage—being brave enough to be vulnerable and honestly express who you are, how you feel, and what you’ve experienced.** For example, it’s having the courage to admit to your boss that you’re struggling with your workload and need help.

> **Ordinary Courage in Women and Girls**
> 
> In the footnotes of _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown states that she first encountered the term “ordinary courage” in the work of clinical psychology professor Annie Rogers. Where Brown talks about _people in general_ needing to have ordinary courage, Rogers’s work specifically discussed ordinary courage in _women and girls_.
> 
> In a research paper, Rogers noted that [young girls often possess and use great ordinary courage, frequently speaking their minds and sharing their vulnerabilities.](https://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-abstract/63/3/265/31617/Voice-Play-and-a-Practice-of-Ordinary-Courage-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) **However, beginning in early adolescence, women stop using ordinary courage,** becoming reticent to share the full truth of what they’re thinking and feeling. According to Rogers, this reduction in ordinary courage coincides with a loss of female confidence and resilience. Furthermore, the reduction in courage is probably the result of cultural norms that discourage women from speaking their minds.
> 
> So, how can we encourage girls to continue to use ordinary courage, even as they enter adolescence? Rogers found that in her experience, [role modeling—being courageous and vulnerable herself—encouraged girls to open up](https://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-abstract/63/3/265/31617/Voice-Play-and-a-Practice-of-Ordinary-Courage-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) and be courageous in turn. Furthermore, research suggests that [participation in adventure-based programs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325455333_Inspiring_Courage_in_Girls_An_Evaluation_of_Practices_and_Outcomes)—outdoor retreats that often involve [completing challenging physical and mental tasks in a group-based setting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51518683_Adventure-based_programming_Exemplary_youth_development_practice)—can encourage courage in adolescent girls.

#### Compassion

Brown calls practicing compassion an exercise in bravery, vulnerability, and acceptance. Put more simply, see compassion as **being kind to yourself and others.**

As well as explaining what compassion _is_, Brown clearly defines what it _isn’t_. It’s not condemning the person (or thing) that caused your, or another person’s, pain. Likewise, it’s not trying to _erase_ the pain by seeking a resolution to that cause. Instead, it’s merely allowing yourself, or another person, to feel their feelings and express their pain. It’s about empathizing with the person who needs compassion (whether that’s you or someone else), not trying to “fix” them or their issues.

For example: If a friend confesses that her manager is belittling her at work, don’t jump to finding a fix for the issue, like suggesting she speak to human resources. Likewise, don’t rush to blame your friend or her manager for causing the issue. Instead, listen deeply to how your friend is feeling. Express empathy based on similar experiences you’ve had.

> **Empathy and _Nonviolent Communication_**
> 
> Brown’s ideas on _true_ compassion involving empathetic listening are backed up by Marshall Rosenberg in his work _[Nonviolent Communication](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication)_. Rosenberg argues that many of us fall into one of the traps Brown described: [trying to analyze and solve people’s pain, rather than just listening to and empathizing with it.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/nonviolent-communication/chapters-7-8)
> 
> In Rosenberg’s view, we commonly make this mistake because **empathizing with others is hard and can be emotionally draining.** So, we take the easier option of entering “fix-it” mode. However, to help others and maintain strong relationships, we must learn to simply listen to people, as difficult as that may be at first.

#### Connection

Brown presents a definition of connection that’s personal rather than objective. To her, it’s an intangible energy generated when we form an open, judgment-free, and mutually sustaining bond with another person. **More simply, understand connection as building meaningful and fulfilling relationships with others.**

Citing the work of psychologist Daniel Goleman—specifically, his book _[Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/103/1030254/social-intelligence/9780099464921.html)—**Brown asserts that, at the most fundamental, biological level, humans need to develop strong relationships with others.**_ She suggests that we can strengthen our connections by reaching out to other people regularly. We should also work to connect with them on more than a superficial level: We should share our honest thoughts and feelings with others and encourage them to do the same.

> **Connection and Social Media**
> 
> You might think that social media sites are great places to connect with other people. However, according to Brown, **while these platforms provide a convenient way of contacting people, they’re not the place to form _real and deep connections_.**
> 
> Various other writers and researchers back this view. For instance, in his book _[Lost Connections](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/lost-connections)_—about the social and societal factors that can contribute to depression—journalist Johann Hari also asserts that [social media communication doesn’t provide the same benefits as in-person connection](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/lost-connections/part-2-chapter-3). Furthermore, Cal Newport argues in his book _[Digital Minimalism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/digital-minimalism)_ that [replacing in-person communication with digital communication can actually erode our social skills](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/digital-minimalism/chapter-5).

> **How to See Our Own Worthiness**
> 
> Brown seems to be unique in explicitly connecting the cultivation of worthiness to practicing courage, compassion, and connection. Other writers have differing ideas on how we can learn to see our own worth:
> 
> - In _[12 Rules for Life](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life)_, Jordan Peterson claims that the solution to low self-worth is to [remember that you have a unique mission to pursue](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/12-rules-for-life/rule-2) and to recognize that you’re just as worthy of care and help as anyone else.
>     
> - In _[The Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis)_, Jonathan Haidt ties feeling self-worth to [having a purpose and feeling like you’re part of a greater mission](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/chapter-9).
>     
> - In _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within)_, Tony Robbins argues that [feeling in control of your life is essential to cultivating high self-esteem](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-13).
>     
> 
> If this diversity of opinion shows anything, it’s that self-worth is complex, with many factors feeding into or inhibiting it.
