## How React elements work
If the type is a string, the element represents a DOM node, while if itâ€™s a function, the element represents a component.

React uses a technique called the Virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. => [Think of the Virtual DOM as a rehearsal before the actual performance. By rehearsing the changes in the Virtual DOM, React can minimize the actual changes needed in the real DOM, resulting in a smoother and more performant user experience.]

==Reconciliation==
Reconciliation in React is the process of comparing the Virtual DOM with the actual DOM and efficiently updating the actual DOM to reflect the changes in the Virtual DOM. This process is crucial for React's performance as it allows React to minimize unnecessary DOM manipulation and maintain a consistent and up-to-date representation of the user interface.

Here's a simplified explanation of the reconciliation process:

1. **State Change:** When a component's state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree to represent the updated state.

2. **Diffing Algorithm:** React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the existing Virtual DOM tree to identify the differences between them.
    
3. **Patching:** React applies the identified changes to the actual DOM in a minimal and efficient manner.
    

Reconciliation ensures that the actual DOM reflects the current state of the application, without re-rendering the entire DOM from scratch. This makes React applications more responsive and performant, especially when dealing with complex UI updates.
