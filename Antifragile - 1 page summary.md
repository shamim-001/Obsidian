## 1-Page Summary

_Antifragile_ is the fourth book in former options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s five-book _Incerto_ series, which explores randomness and its unpredictable effects. In this book, Taleb discusses strategies and principles that will allow us to be helped by unforeseen events rather than harmed by them.

People often think that the opposite of fragility is durability. If something is fragile, that means it’s easily broken. Therefore, if something isn’t easily broken, logically that should mean it’s the opposite of fragile. **However, there’s another step beyond durability: something that actually gets stronger under stress.** Since there isn’t an established English word for such a thing, let’s call it _antifragility_—not just the lack of fragility, but its true opposite.

_Antifragile_ discusses:

- Sources of fragility and antifragility
- Why antifragility is necessary in all aspects of life
- Strategies to avoid fragility and seek antifragility
- The ethical components of fragility and antifragility

### What Antifragility Is and Why We Need It

We live in an unpredictable world. The models and theories we use to try to predict the future invariably fall apart as unforeseen events prove them wrong and, in turn, destroy the plans we made based on those models. Clearly, systems based on such flawed models are bound to be fragile—easily broken.

The solution to this problem is antifragility. Instead of a never-ending search for more accurate models and better predictions, **all we need to do is make sure that we’re in a position to benefit from uncertainty and volatility instead of being harmed by it.**

This is hardly a new concept; nature exhibits antifragility in almost everything she creates. An organism can strengthen itself through minor damage in the form of exercise. In a similar sense, a species can strengthen itself through minor damage in the form of natural selection, which leads to evolution.

However, unlike nature, humans try to control the world through models and rules. We think we can perfectly predict the future and avoid any shocks that would cause our fragile systems to fall apart. We think we can outsmart millions of years of evolution and antifragility, and we’re almost invariably wrong.

Instead of trying to predict the future, we should assume that there will be major events we can’t see coming—because, sooner or later, there will be. If we’re prepared for them, using the methods and practices explained in this book, we can make sure that such events work to our advantage instead of hurting us. **By avoiding fragility and embracing antifragility wherever possible, we can set ourselves up to thrive in an uncertain world.**

#### Antifragility is Growth Through Hardship

The phrase “necessity is the mother of invention” points to another, more immediate sort of antifragility. **Basically, people overreact to setbacks**. They use more energy and effort than they need to compensate for the problems they experience. The excess energy goes on to become innovation and progress.

For example, a speaker who’s quiet or hard to understand will capture his audience’s attention more effectively than one who sounds like a trained actor. By straining to hear and understand him, the audience will naturally pay more attention and retain the information better.

However, this is only effective up to a certain point. **An audience that can barely understand the speaker will pay closer attention; an audience that can’t hear him at all will simply give up.**

The opposite is also true: A lack of challenge causes people to _undercompensate_. For example, the automation of airplanes actually led to an increase in preventable flying accidents at first. The pilots were becoming complacent and—more dangerously—bored. Their skills and their attention waned, and as a result they got into accidents that more alert pilots wouldn’t have.

In short, people in a challenging situation will rise to the challenge and become stronger from it. However, people who get too comfortable miss out on the chance to benefit from antifragility, like the pilots who relied too much on their newly automated systems and ended up crashing their planes.

### Where to Find Antifragility

A basic guideline is that anything living—whether literally, as with organisms, or figuratively, as with an artist’s growing and changing popularity—has some degree of antifragility. **Another way to think about antifragility is in terms of simple versus complex systems.** A light switch is a simple system: You flip the switch and the light turns on. If any part of the system is damaged, like a faulty wire or a burned-out bulb, the system works less effectively or not at all. In other words, this system is fragile.

A human body, on the other hand, is a complex system. It has many different parts that communicate with each other and help each other compensate for stressors. When part of a system is able to communicate that it’s been damaged, and other parts of that system are able to compensate for that damage—or overcompensate, as discussed earlier—antifragility is the result. In humans, we can see a simple example with exercise: Weak muscles break down and become bigger and stronger as they heal.

So, in short, simple systems are easily broken while complex systems often have built-in ways to absorb shocks. When complex systems are able to strengthen themselves in response to the damage, they’re antifragile.

### Why Modern Society is Fragile

Modern society, in many ways, tries to remove the stress and randomness from life. We schedule our every move: When we work, when we eat, when we sleep, not to mention _how_ we do all of those things. When every step is preplanned, there’s little struggle or danger except in carrying out that plan.

The side effect of this lack of struggle is a lack of personal growth, of artistic expression, and in many cases, of valuable lessons. Without the randomness and danger of life, there’s no chance for us to benefit from antifragility.

For example, one learns a language best by being immersed in it, by making mistake after mistake before learning how to communicate effectively. However, to avoid that embarrassment and struggle, we teach languages in classrooms using books and rules, and we get much worse results.

**As complex living things, humans benefit from—and secretly hunger for—some amount of risk and chance.** Someone who can’t find the energy to go to a preplanned gym session could lift a car off of a trapped child, if need be. Someone who can’t stick to a diet will skip meals quite easily if there’s simply no food to be had.

“Modern” societies are focused on making life last longer and longer, even as the people living those lives get sicker and sicker. By contrast, in “primitive” hunter-gatherer societies, the effects of old age didn’t take hold until very near to the end of life.

#### How Variation Creates Stability

Modernization promotes uniformity, which people often confuse with stability. If something never changes, then naturally it seems stable.

However, what people miss is that when such a system _does_ change, it’s usually catastrophic. Like the switch and the lightbulb, the only reason an unchanging system changes is because something breaks. **In other words, it’s fragile.**

A system that has some natural variation might seem less stable and less reliable than the previous situation, but it’s usually more stable in the long run. A system that’s naturally subject to change and randomness will be able to cope with variations. It may even become better as those variations destroy weak and flawed parts of the system, leaving the best and most stable parts behind. **Such a system would be antifragile.**

For example, it might seem like a bank clerk has a more stable job than a cab driver. The clerk has a fixed schedule and brings home the same amount of money each week, while the cab driver may have good days and bad days that make his income seem less reliable.

However, the clerk’s stability is an illusion. He’s totally dependent on the bank and, on a larger scale, the economy to keep him employed. If something goes wrong he could find himself out of a job, suddenly bringing home no income at all. There’s no chance for the clerk to recover from the shock or grow stronger from it; his job is simply gone.

The cab driver, on the other hand, is relatively protected from shocks like that. There’s no chance that he could suddenly lose his job, because people will always need cab drivers. If his income starts to drop, he improves his skills—becoming a “stronger” cab driver—and continues about his business. **The cab driver’s career is variable, and therefore has the chance to be antifragile.**

#### Size and Control Breed Fragility

Modern society also tends to create large, rigidly controlled systems: centralized governments, multinational corporations, and so on. **Large systems are more vulnerable to fragility because they have, and need, many more resources.** The effects when those systems break are also much more pronounced.

For example, if a large bank gets into financial trouble and has to suddenly sell off billions of dollars in stock, it creates a shock that affects the entire global market. However, a bank a 10th of that size in a similar situation might only have to sell stock valued at millions, not billions, which the market could absorb much more easily.

**Along with size, another common cause of fragility is rigid, top-down control.** Large organizations such as major banks, corporations, and even (or especially) governments are prone to this type of fragility. They’re run based on rules, predictions, and models, which almost inevitably fail sooner or later. When that happens, as in the above example of the bank, the results can be disastrous.

Perhaps the best “federal” government in the world is Switzerland’s, which can hardly be called a federal government at all. It’s a loose collection of small cantons or regional governments, each of which deals primarily with its own local issues. There’s no grand supreme leader handing down edicts to the cantons.

While there is occasional friction between cantons when an issue impacts more than one of them, that actually serves to strengthen the system as a whole. There’s some natural variation in how they run their affairs, which gives the entire system a chance to benefit from antifragility. Good policies survive, bad policies are eventually thrown out. **This seems to be the ideal system of government: small, decentralized, and with some chance for small struggles.**

#### The Risks of Human Intervention

Modern society tends to rely on predictive models to plan for the future. Rather than setting ourselves up for antifragility, we try to foresee everything that might go wrong and plan specifically for those events. This is reflected in everything from weather forecasts to quarterly projections at a corporation.

**However, predictions and models are notoriously fragile and easily destroyed by a single piece of data that doesn’t fit.** Decisions based on those models are similarly fragile, and often have harsh consequences: People lose jobs, stock markets crash, and sometimes people even die.

In spite of predictive models’ terrible track records, many people insist on using them to decide on courses of action. This is especially dangerous when people want to intervene in something that would be just fine if left alone.

Perhaps the best example of this tendency is in medicine. Medicine has always had risks and harm associated with it, which are called _iatrogenics_—unintended harm from treatments. For example, before we knew what germs were, countless people died of so-called “hospital fever.” Even now, medicines and treatments almost always have side effects, some of which can be more devastating than the disease they’re supposed to treat.

Therefore, ideally we’d only intervene when potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Someone who will die without heart medication should, of course, have it. Someone whose blood pressure is sometimes a bit high would probably do better without it—the side effects of the medication may be more harmful than the condition.

Iatrogenics and its non-medical equivalents happen because of a common logical fallacy: **People mistake a lack of evidence for evidence.** Smoking, for example, was once thought to have health benefits. There wasn’t yet evidence that it was harmful, so people took that as evidence that it _wasn’t_ harmful. It wasn’t until decades later that people realized the horrific side effects.

**We could avoid many harmful side effects if we simply shift the burden of proof.** Rather than having to prove that something _is_ harmful, we should have to prove that it _isn’t_ harmful before starting to use it—guilty until proven innocent, so to speak.

### How to Become Antifragile

The key to antifragility is having more potential benefits available than risks. When that’s the case, on average you’ll gain more than you lose from random events. For example, you might put a small amount of money into stocks with high potential to increase or decrease in value. If the stocks go down, you haven’t lost anything you couldn’t afford to lose. However, if they go up, you could stand to make a great deal of money.

**One way to make sure you’re in an antifragile situation is to have many options available to you, so you can make the best choice at any given time.**

This principle applies even in very mundane situations. For example, someone invited to a dinner party that isn’t especially interesting, but is better than eating alone, might call around first to see if any other friends are available that evening. If a more interesting opportunity presents itself, the person can skip the party and do that instead. If not, the party is available as a fallback option, with the key word being _option_.

This person has very little to lose and a fair amount to gain. At worst, he winds up at a party that’s less exciting than he’d hoped. At best, he finds something more fun to do and has an excellent evening.

**Making proper use of options doesn’t take any great intellect or education, only rationality.** Nature itself uses optionality to always find the best outcomes—or at least, the outcomes that will allow life to continue. Countless mutations and evolutionary trends fail, and the organisms carrying them die out. However, these failures don’t harm nature itself. At the same time, the beneficial mutations and trends propagate, making it ever-more-likely that life will continue to exist on Earth. You wouldn’t call nature intelligent, but there’s no arguing that it’s rational.

Related to the intelligence versus rationality point is the idea of the long shot. Many intelligent people will point out that lotteries and casinos—which offer very small chances of very large payouts—aren’t worth it. And they’re correct: The options that you get from lotteries and casinos are too expensive, giving you ever-increasing downsides that are unlikely to ever be offset by your winnings.

Where these intelligent-but-irrational people go wrong is in applying the same logic to _any_ kind of long shot. For example, it’s extremely unlikely that buying stock in any given company will make you rich. However, if you invest a few dollars each in a lot of different companies—including, say, Amazon or Apple when they were first starting out—you’ll have limited cost with the potential for immense profits.

In short, decisions made based on traditional intelligence—which is to say, book smarts—tend to be fragile. They can easily go wrong if you misunderstand something, or incorrectly apply your knowledge, like how people who understand the lottery try to apply the same logic to the stock market. However, decisions based on rationality tend to benefit from antifragility; rationality is simply about examining your options and choosing the best one at any given time.

#### Exponential Benefit and Risk

Both fragility and antifragility have exponential effects. **In other words, as the significance of an event increases, the effect of that event increases even faster.**

For example, if you drummed your fingers against a window, you wouldn’t damage it at all; however, you could break it quite easily with a punch. Thousands of tiny impacts from your fingers don’t add up to the same effect as one large impact from your fist.

In the same way, a fragile situation has a limit to how good it can be, but the negative impacts increase infinitely (or near-infinitely). A window can never be anything more than a window, and once broken, it’s useless.

However, an antifragile situation is exactly the opposite, with limited risk but potentially infinite (or near-infinite) benefits. The previous example of many small stock purchases shows this principle: $100 invested in Amazon back in 1997 would be worth around $120,000 now.

We can sketch these situations with the graphs shown below:

![antifragile_graph.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/antifragile_graph.png)

In both cases, as the _significance_ of an event increases (in other words, as we go farther to the right), the _outcome_ of that effect becomes either much worse (for fragility) or much better (for antifragility).

**The two graphs also illustrate why fragility dislikes randomness, and antifragility loves it.** Imagine picking random points on each of the graphs; depending on where the point falls on the _significance_ axis, it may have a positive or negative _outcome_. Now imagine that you keep picking such random points over and over again. Eventually you’re going to land on a point with enough significance that the outcome is either hugely negative (for the fragility graph) or hugely positive (for the antifragility graph).

### The Ethics of Fragility

**Finally, fragility and antifragility have an ethical component as well.** Modern society makes it possible to give the benefits of a situation to one person or group and the harm of that situation to another—in other words, it makes one person’s situation antifragile by making others’ situations fragile, which is blatantly unfair.

The problem is imbalanced agency. Some people have the power to make decisions that affect many others, and the others have no choice but to accept the outcomes of those decisions. To give an extreme example, this imbalanced agency is how we end up with countries that have a handful of billionaires, and millions of people in poverty.

When we say _agency_, what we really mean is optionality. **The people who have the power are the ones who have all the options and therefore, all the antifragility.** They can shunt the fragility onto those who are less powerful, generally the poor and the marginalized. This is why the CEO of a failing bank can be let go with a severance package worth tens of millions, while taxpayers are being gutted to pay for his bank’s bailout.

**The best way to correct this imbalance is by making sure that everyone has something to lose—some kind of fragility that they need to defend against.** Remember that antifragility of the whole depends on the fragility of the parts, like muscles getting stronger after the weak parts of them break down. By allowing some people to gain all the benefits while others take on all the harm, modern society has overturned that principle.

Rather than correcting this imbalance with complex rules and massive enforcement agencies (remember, large size and rigid controls make systems fragile), we could address it with simple laws. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi found an ideal solution almost four millennia ago.

One tenet in the Code stated that any injuries or deaths caused by the collapse of a house would also be inflicted on the one who built that house. If the owner of the house died, the builder would be executed; if the owner’s son died, the builder’s son would be executed, and so on.

It might sound brutal to our modern-day sensibilities, but the punishment wasn’t the point. **The point was to give the builder a stake in what he was building.** A craftsman knows his craft better than any government-sponsored team of safety inspectors, so this is the simplest and most effective way to make sure that what he makes is safe and of good quality.

**So, in short, the best way to ensure ethical behavior is by making sure everyone has something to lose**. Someone who has to shoulder the risks herself, rather than diverting them to those with fewer options, will most likely act in good faith.
