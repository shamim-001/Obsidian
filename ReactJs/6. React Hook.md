### React Hook Definition
React hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a way to reuse stateful logic without writing a class component. Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8.

In simple terms, a React hook is a function that enables functional components to have state, lifecycle methods, and other React features that were previously only available in class components. Hooks make it easier to write and organize reusable logic, making functional components more powerful and flexible.
