# Tools of Titans

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Inspiration and Goals

We’ll start with the foundation of success—how to set goals and adopt a courageous mindset.

### Visualize Your Goals

If you don’t know where you’re going, why are you pedaling so hard?

Many titans **visualize their long-term goals**, so it becomes easier to know what they’re fighting for. It also becomes easier to focus, since you know what won’t drive you closer to your goals and thus can say no to.

Specific tips from titans:

- Arnold Schwarzenegger believes that having a clear vision of the final goal makes the work in between easier. It helps you stomach all the hard work and pain it takes to reach your goal, since you know why you’re pushing so hard.
- Tony Robbins spends the last part of his morning meditation imagining the three things he’ll make happen that day. He visualizes the successful outcome and viscerally feels the emotions to motivate him.
- Dilbert creator Scott Adams picks his goal and writes it down 15 times, every day. He finds that this increases serendipity—it’s as if the universe provides opportunities to make you successful. More pragmatically, he believes this focus helps your brain filter in the opportunities that fit your goal and filter out wasteful opportunities, much in the same way that even in a room full of noise, you can clearly hear someone call your name.

People often confuse dreams and goals. **A dream is something you fantasize about that will never happen. A goal is something you set a plan for, work toward, and achieve.**

### Be Courageous. Be Brazen

Do you have a big goal you would love to tackle, but you don’t feel ready? **You’ve likely put artificial constraints on yourself.**

Many titans spoke about pushing past artificial boundaries placed on them by society or by themselves.

Realize that every titan you admire started out where you are today—with formidable obstacles towering in front of you. The difference with the titans is they had the courage to push past these obstacles.

Here are selected quotes and stories on having courage:

- Steve Jobs: “Everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”
- Dan Carlin: “Don’t be afraid to do something you’re not qualified to do.”
- Eric Weinstein (Managing Director of Thiel Capital): Being told that something is impossible shouldn’t be the end of it. Instead, it should trigger another train of thought—how can you get around it and make it possible?
- Neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley chooses to do research that other people might find foolish or even dumb. You only have one short life to make an impact, and being afraid of making a mistake is not how you do it.
- Author Brene Brown dares herself to choose courage over comfort.
- Entertainer Jamie Foxx, born Eric Bishop, started his career at an improv venue. There’d be 100 men and 5 women in line to perform, and the manager would always pick the girls to get variety. In response, Jamie picked a unisex name so he’d be much more likely to get picked.
- Marketer Noah Kagan suggests the 10% challenge: Go to the counter and ask for 10% off your coffee. You have to learn to ask for things and put yourself out there.

What you’re most afraid of doing is often what you most need to do.

#### Tim Ferriss’s Fear Exercise

If you ever feel afraid of doing something, try Tim Ferriss’s fear exercise.

First, think about the change you want to make.

- If you made the change you’re afraid of, **what is the absolute worst that could happen**? Picture the situation in vividly clear detail.
- How bad would this outcome be? How permanent would this damage be?
- If this happened, how could you work your way back and recover?
- How likely is this absolute worst case outcome, from 0% to 100%?
- Now that you’ve pictured the worst case outcome, what’s the best case outcome? What’s a realistic good outcome? How would your life be better here?

Now think about what life would be like if you didn’t make the change:

- If left at the status quo, what does life look like in 6 months? 3 years? Is this the happiest life you could lead? Or would you be poisoned by regret?
- What good reasons do you have to put off this change?

After this exercise, you likely realize that the worst case is nowhere near permanently crippling. Even if you fail, you’ll be able to recover your old life just fine.

Ultimately, you may realize that you lack great reasons not to make the change, other than your own fear.

#### You Don’t Need Much to Start

**Don’t be afraid of doing what you want because you believe you lack something critical**—the perfect set of personal connections, ideas, funding, or what have you. These are excuses. You likely already have enough to get started.

Even if you feel you’re in a lowly position, don’t be afraid to punch above your weight class. Talk to people above your current level; find opportunities you’re not qualified for. Just try to be helpful, and listen and learn.

- When investor Chris Sacca worked at Google, he participated in meetings he wasn’t invited to and offered to be helpful by taking notes.
- When the book’s author Tim Ferriss launched his first book, _The 4-Hour Workweek_, he went to a trade conference and parked himself at a lounge where bloggers hung out. He never pitched his book—he just asked a lot of dumb questions so he could learn how to be successful.
- Author Ryan Holiday suggests the “canvas strategy”—early on, your role is to find canvases for other people to paint on. You should help other people do their best work and pave the way for them. Don’t worry about being taken advantage of. Find the grunt work nobody wants to do and constantly strive to be helpful to people. Give your ideas away.
- Football coach Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots started his career as a volunteer by analyzing film of football games, a grunt job in the coaching team.
- Co-founder of The Princeton Review Adam Robinson suggests approaching each interaction as a challenge to delight the other person. This puts the focus off of yourself. Try this approach for job interviews or investment meetings.

If your ego gets in the way and you don’t want to do grunt work, realize that your lower position is simply temporary, and you might as well get the most out of it and prepare yourself for more success later.

### Being Tough

Getting through rough patches requires grit and willpower. If you’re not tough, how can you be tougher?

It’s simple: **If you want to be tough, be tough. Make the tough call on your very next decision.**

US Army general Stanley McChrystal has a few tips:

- Push yourself harder than what you think you’re capable of. You’ll find strength you didn’t realize you had.
- Surround yourself with people who share the same difficulties as you, and traverse difficulties with them. Afterward, you’ll find yourself even more committed to what you struggled for.

Ancient Stoic thinker Seneca suggests that, for 3 days, you throw away your comforts and endure a period of simplicity—like sleeping in a sleeping bag or eating only oatmeal. This will reset your setpoint for comfort, and afterward even the smallest morsels of food will be delicious.
