## Chapter 3: Groupthink and Creativity

U.S. institutions, including our schools and workplaces, are structured to serve the extrovert ideal. The organizing principle is “Groupthink,” which prioritizes teamwork above all. Groupthink practices, such as “cooperative learning” in schools and open offices and brainstorming in the workplace, are based on the erroneous belief collaboration is necessary for creativity and intellectual achievement.

The Groupthink notion that creativity is the product of teamwork has influential advocates, including prominent author Malcolm Gladwell, who wrote that innovation is “fundamentally social.” Organizational consultant Warren Bennis claimed in _Organizing Genius_ that the “great group” has replaced the “great man.” However, in reality, an exclusive focus on collaboration actually undercuts creativity and achievement.

### The Rise of Groupthink in the Workplace

**The belief in teamwork above all dominates the corporate workplace**. Organizing employees into teams became a popular practice in the 1990s—half of all companies used teams by 2000, while nearly all do so today. Most managers believe teamwork is necessary for success.

Some teams work together remotely while others work face-to-face, but all require a large investment in time, which can include online or in-person meetings, retreats, and team-building exercises, brainstorming sessions, working on shared documents, and keeping track of everyone’s time with shared online calendars.

**To facilitate face-to-face teamwork on site, many companies have implemented open- office designs** with no walls or private offices and little or no privacy. While 70% of employees work in an open setting, the amount of space per employee has shrunk by 300 square feet since the 1970s. As one CEO described it, work has shifted from “I” or individually focused settings to “we” settings.

### Groupthink in Schools

**The demands of business for employees who can work in teams have reshaped teaching**—schools are training children via cooperative and group learning methods to fit into the culture of corporate America.

As a fifth-grade public school teacher in Manhattan explained it, children are being taught that success and respect depend on verbal abilities rather than on originality and insight. “You have to be someone who speaks well and calls attention to yourself.”

Besides teamwork, **children are also being taught leadership and managerial skills with an eye to the needs of the business culture**. For instance, a third-grade teacher explained how she had put a quiet child who preferred to work independently in charge of the safety patrol so he could practice leadership.

Cooperative learning entails grouping children’s desks into pods to facilitate group activities. There are rules for group work—for instance, one fourth-grade teacher’s rule was that children couldn’t ask a teacher for help unless everyone in their group had the same question, presumably to encourage students to help each other find answers. Even math and creative writing, which used to be thought of as individual activities, are sometimes taught through group work.

The cooperative learning approach supposedly encourages students to take responsibility for their education. However, **training all children to function in a corporate or team-oriented environment ignores the skills needed to achieve excellence**—for instance, intense practice alone (more on this later).

### Fueled by the Internet

The trends of corporate teams, open offices, and cooperative learning in schools were fueled by the rise of the Internet and lessons drawn from it.

The internet demonstrated the power of collaboration. Shared intelligence and creativity produced resources such as Wikipedia, the open-source operating system Linux, and the grassroots political organization MoveOn.org. Successful collaborations like these, whose results exceeded the sum of their parts, created enthusiasm for the so-called wisdom of the crowd or hive mind.

The success of online collaboration reinforced the belief in the value of face-to-face collaboration and teamwork in workplaces and schools. However, proponents of teamwork and open-office transparency didn’t consider that **online collaboration works differently from in-person collaboration**—in-person interactions are more susceptible to Groupthink in problem-solving and to style over substance.

**The corporate teamwork environment marginalizes the contributions of introverts, who like to work alone**. By contrast, the early Web allowed introverts to work independently on ideas and also share and build on the ideas of others. According to a study of the U.S., Australia, and the U.K., many of the earliest computer developers were introverts who worked alone but contributed to the greater good. For example, Apple’s Steve Wozniak worked alone on a prototype PC, but he shared ideas with a group called the Homebrew Computer Club.

### How Creativity Works

**Research has found that creativity requires 1) solitude and 2) intense concentration.** Because these are the preferred work styles of introverts, it’s not surprising that many of the most creative people are introverts.

In the 1960s, researchers at UC Berkeley compared a group of extremely creative people, including scientists, engineers, writers, and architects, to a group of less-creative types to learn what drives creativity. They found that the most creative people tended to be independent, individualistic, and shy and solitary as teenagers. Other studies have supported these findings. But what gives introverts a creative edge? The likely explanation is that their preference for working in solitude fuels their creativity.

We know from the studies of psychologist Anders Ericsson that **intense solitary work drives extraordinary achievement.** When Ericsson studied violinists, he found that the best spent the most time practicing alone. Ericsson found the same was true for other kinds of high achievers—for instance, for top tournament chess players, serious study alone was the strongest predictor of success.

Ericsson contended that **the key to outstanding achievement—“deliberate practice”—can only be undertaken alone**. In deliberate practice, you identify what you need to learn, work on it, and track your progress. It would be harder to focus on improving in the areas most crucial to you if you practiced in a group. (Shortform note: [Read our summary of Peak by Anders Ericsson here](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/peak).)

This kind of solitary, intense focus on a passion is typical of creative people. Steve Wozniak compared himself to an artist, needing to work alone to control his creation. “I don’t believe anything really revolutionary has been invented by a committee,” he wrote.

Focus on a passion often starts in adolescence—for instance, Wozniak was fascinated by electronics as a teenager and spent hours working on them alone. A 1995 study of 91 extremely creative people found that they were loners as adolescents because their passion made them different from their peers. Examples include author Madeleine L’Engle and Charles Darwin. However, the kind of solitude that drives creativity and achievement is hard to come by in teams and open offices.

### The Open Office Productivity Myth

Although companies are enamored of open offices, **studies have shown that open-office designs reduce rather than enhance productivity**.

For instance, consultant Tom DeMarco and colleagues studied 600 computer programmers in ninety-two companies and found that the top performers worked in settings providing the most personal space, privacy, and control over their surroundings and the least interruption. Since the results of the so-called Coding War Games study were reported in 1987, other studies have also shown that performance and productivity lag in open-office environments.

For one thing, **open offices are characterized by interruptions and noise, which create stress**. A study of 38,000 knowledge workers found that being interrupted is one of the biggest deterrents to productivity. Workers in open offices are more likely to have high blood pressure and get the flu. They experience more friction with coworkers, argue with them more, and worry about others overhearing their phone calls and peeping at their computer screens. A noisy environment also gets in the way of learning. Research shows that people learn better after a quiet walk in the woods than a noisy walk on a city street.

**Multitasking is another productivity myth. Current research shows that the brain can’t focus on two things at the same time**—it actually switches back and forth between tasks, which lowers productivity and increases mistakes by up to 50%.

Employees are often well aware of the drawbacks of overly stimulating open-office environments. For example:

- A video design company in California, Backbone Entertainment, found that its video game developers, who tended to be creative introverts, disliked the company’s open floor plan, so the company switched to cubicles.
- In designing its new Ohio headquarters in 2000, Reebok thought its shoe designers would prefer shared workspace where they could brainstorm ideas. But when managers asked them, shoe designers said they needed quiet surroundings in order to concentrate.

### Brainstorming Doesn’t Work Either

**Brainstorming in a group, another favorite of the Groupthink or team-oriented culture, also fails to deliver more creative or better ideas**.

Alex Osborn, an advertising man and author in the 1940s and ‘50s, came up with the idea of brainstorming because he was concerned that employees at his ad agency weren’t producing very creative material. He believed this was because they were afraid to share their ideas for fear of judgment, so he created a discussion process intended to remove the threat of criticism. The rules were:

- Don’t criticize.
- Don’t hold back.
- The more ideas you have the better.
- Build on others’ ideas.

With this process, Osborn believed that groups produced better ideas than people working alone. He made grandiose claims for it and other companies picked up the idea. Brainstorming soon was incorporated into the business culture of teamwork.

However, it doesn’t actually work as advertised. In 1963, a study of mining company employees by a psychology professor showed that people working on their own, whether they were executives or research scientists, produced more ideas than those working in groups and the ideas were of the same or better quality.

**Research over the last forty years has also underscored that brainstorming doesn’t produce better ideas**. Among the findings: idea-generating performance gets worse as brainstorming groups get bigger. For instance, groups of nine produce fewer and worse ideas than groups of six; groups of six do worse than groups of four. Organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham concluded that based on the scientific evidence, businesses would be crazy to use brainstorming. When you want efficiency or creativity, he said, it’s better to let people work alone.

According to psychologists, there are three reasons brainstorming doesn’t work:

- Some people stay on the sidelines and let others do all the talking.
- Only one person can talk at a time, while others have to be silent.
- In spite of the rules to suspend judgment, people still hold back for fear of looking stupid.

Research has shown that group influence also can hinder discovering the best ideas: people tend to go along with others, even when they know the others are wrong, in order to fit in. In fact, the fear of rejection can be so strong that it makes us change our perceptions.

Despite the evidence against brainstorming, it remains popular. Studies show that **participants usually believe their group performed much better than it actually did**. The reason may be that it makes people feel connected—which may have value—but it doesn’t inspire good ideas.

#### Online Brainstorming

**In contrast to brainstorming in a group meeting, brainstorming online can be effective**.

When brainstorming online, well-managed groups are more effective than individuals at coming up with viable ideas. Unlike face-to-face brainstorming, research shows that the larger the online brainstorming group, the better it does. The same applies to online collaboration on academic research. Professors who work together online produce research that has greater impact than the work of those meeting face-to-face or working alone.

### Alternatives to Groupthink

In spite of its drawbacks, face-to-face collaboration does have some benefits—for instance, studies show that it creates trust more readily than online collaboration does. And sometimes being around people without directly interacting with them—for instance, in a cafe where people are working individually—helps your mind work. But working in a cafe is different from working in an open office because you have some control over your environment—for instance, deciding when to arrive and how long to stay, as well as where to sit and whether to interact with anyone.

**The key to effective collaboration isn’t to stop meeting face-to-face, but to improve the process to take advantage of the strengths of both extroverts and introverts**. For example, balance the membership of groups with both introverts and extroverts, and assign tasks in accordance with people’s strengths.

Also, create work environments where people can choose to connect in social spaces or to work alone in a quiet space. In schools, we should teach children to work with others, but also to engage in “deliberate practice” by themselves.

Some companies, such as Pixar and Microsoft, are creating office designs that include a mix of quiet work spaces, meeting areas, and social spaces like cafes where people can talk without interrupting coworkers’ focus. For example, Microsoft offices have sliding doors and moveable walls that employees can adjust to fit the level of interaction they want. These flexible spaces accommodate both introverts and extroverts.
