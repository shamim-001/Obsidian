## Fundamental 1: Don’t Criticize or Complain

The book starts with three general principles that underlie the other chapters. The idea that “people crave importance” is repeated the most often throughout the book, so it’s worth paying special attention to.

### Principles

- People don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong they may be.
    - Remember that people are “creatures of emotion,” with their own biases and motivated by ego and pride.
- Criticizing people nearly always puts them on the defensive. They dig in their heels, rationalizing their actions as just.
    - Even Al Capone lamented that he was just helping others have a good time during Prohibition, and all he got was abuse.
    - Family members of criminals frequently go into denial, blaming the system instead of the person for the crimes.
- **Criticism hurts a person’s pride and sense of importance**.
- It may feel good to tell someone off, but this is usually harmful in the long term. People continue to justify their actions and condemn you for the criticism. People can harbor resentments for insults that last a literal lifetime.
- Any weak person can criticize or complain. It takes real character to understand and forgive.

### Tactics

- Consider the information that you don’t have about the situation. Consider the most favorable scenario in which the situation happened, and whether you should think more kindly of the mistake.
    - Most likely, you would have acted similarly if you were in the same circumstances.
    - During the Civil War, as Lee retreated, Lincoln ordered General Meade to cross a river and engage. Meade refused. Lincoln thought to excoriate Meade on how he had single-handedly lost the Union the war, but he instead imagined being on the frontlines of battle - seeing the deaths of thousands of your men, hearing the screams of the injured.
    - It’s common for parents to criticize their children for failing to meet the yardstick of adults. Remember they’re just children, and that you once took your parents’ criticism the same way.
- Even when someone commits the gravest mistake, consider not lambasting her, but rather encouraging her to rise to her otherwise high standards of excellence.
    - Bob Hoover’s plane crashed when the mechanic inserted jet fuel instead of gasoline. Instead of lashing out, he threw his arm around the guy and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my plane tomorrow.”
- Before you send an angry message to someone, wait overnight. More often than not you’ll dial back the anger.

### Examples

- A wife asked a husband for 6 ways she could improve herself. Instead of listing a hundred, he waited a day to think, then bought her 6 roses and said “I wouldn’t change anything about you - I like you the way you are.”
- A safety coordinator found employees not wearing hard hats. Instead of rebuking them for violating safety code, he reminded the men that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and that if they cared about their safety, it should be worn on the job. (As we’ll discuss later, this also conveys the message in terms of the employees’ interests.)
