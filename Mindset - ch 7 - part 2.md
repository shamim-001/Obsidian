## Chapter 7 Part 2: Mindset for Parents, Teachers, and Coaches

Parents want to help their kids to succeed in school and life, yet their **comments, actions and attempts to be helpful often send the wrong message**.

Words and actions from adults tell young children, students, and athletes what to think about themselves. They can convey a fixed-mindset message that children’s traits are permanent and they’ll be judged for them. Or they can convey a growth-oriented message that children (and all people) are continually developing and adults are committed to helping them in this process.

Children are extremely sensitive to these messages. **They’re concerned about how they’re being tested/judged and what will happen if they fall short.**

### Kids Hear Messages Constantly

**Children with fixed mindsets hear judgment from their parents** — it feels as though their abilities are always being measured.

To understand children’s thinking, researchers asked them several questions. Here are the responses from both the fixed-minded and growth-oriented kids.

**Question #1**: Imagine that your parents are happy when you get a good grade. Why would they be happy?

- Fixed-minded children responded along the lines of: “They were happy to see I was smart.”
- Growth-minded children said a good grade meant they’d buckled down and worked hard.

**Question #2**: Imagine that your parents talked with you about your performance when you did poorly. Why would they do this?

- Fixed-minded children responded that their parents probably were worried that they weren’t smart, that bad grades might mean they weren’t smart.
- Growth-minded children said their parents likely wanted to teach them better study methods for the future.

**Question #3**: Imagine your parents were upset when you didn’t share. Why would they feel this way?

- Fixed-minded children responded that their parents thought the behavior showed they were a bad person.
- Growth-minded children said their parents probably wanted to help them learn and get along better with other kids.

Normal kids often misbehave (actually, every three minutes) — it can be an opportunity either to judge them as having failed or to help them grow.

Children pick up these lessons from an early age, even as toddlers. They learn either that mistakes merit judgment and punishment or they can bring suggestions and help for how to do better. Teaching rather than judging is what helps children learn.

#### Kids Pass On Messages

Children are eager to pass on things they’ve learned. This includes messages from either mindset.

For example, researchers asked children what advice they’d give to a child who was having trouble with math. Children with a growth mindset said they would advise the child to read the problem again, think harder, or maybe ask the teacher for help. Children with fixed mindsets had no help to offer since they viewed ability as a fixed trait. For instance, one child just said, “I’m sorry.”

### Messages about Success: When Praise Hurts

When children do something well, most parents want to encourage them or build their confidence, but often they’re not helping the way they think they are. Here’s how many parents respond — and what their kids hear:

- “Wow, you learned that fast; you’re really smart.” What the child hears: If you don’t learn fast, it means you’re dumb.
- “Look how smart you are — you got an A without even studying.” What the child hears: If I have to study, it means I’m not smart.
- “Look at that artwork — You’re the next Picasso.” What the child hears: If I draw something difficult and fail, they’ll see I’m not really a talented artist. I’d better not take the chance.

These examples show that **praising children’s intelligence hurts their motivation and performance**. Children getting fixed-mindset praise develop resistance to difficult challenges that might show they’re not so smart or talented. If they try and fail, they further lose motivation and confidence. They believe the message that their performance — success or failure — reflects who they are: If success means they’re smart, failure means they’re dumb.

**The best way for parents to help their children build confidence is to teach them to welcome challenges, to want to understand mistakes, to enjoy effort, and to continually look for and try new learning strategies.**

#### How to Praise Children

**The research findings on the de-motivating effects of praise don’t mean praising children is bad and we shouldn’t do it.** Children love praise and need adult approval. The key is to avoid praise that judges their intelligence or ability, which implies you’re proud of them for an inherent trait rather than for their effort and improvement.

Applying a growth mindset, **praise them for what they’ve achieved through good study strategies, practice, and persistence**. Show interest in _how_ they succeeded or improved, in their efforts and choices. For instance, you might comment, “You really studied hard and it paid off. I can see how much you improved. Outlining the important points was a good strategy.” Or, “It’s great that you kept trying different ways of solving that math problem until you got it.”

For a student who worked hard and didn’t do so well, a helpful response would be: “Everyone learns differently. Let’s try to find a way that works for you.” (This approach is especially helpful for children with learning disabilities.) Or, “I like your effort. Let’s work on it some more and figure out where you’re having trouble.”

For a student who did something quickly without mistakes, avoid praising speed and perfection, which will get in the way of tackling challenges. It would be more constructive to say something like, “You finished that assignment so quickly that it must have been too easy. Let’s try something else that you can really learn from.”

Sometimes parents use growth-oriented language with _their_ children, but then undercut it by expressing judgments (fixed-mindset statements) about other people, which the kids overhear. For instance, they might remark, “Some have it and some don’t” or “What a lame-brain.” When children hear things like this, they wonder whether those judgments apply to them too. Remember, they’re always listening.

Teachers also can easily fall into the trap of praising children in ways that kill motivation. For example, praising great mathematicians as geniuses is a subtle reference to a fixed mindset. It would be better to describe mathematicians as people who developed a passion for math, worked at it, and made big discoveries.

#### Reassuring Children

When children are preparing to take a challenging test, it’s natural for parents to want to reassure them by saying something like, “You can do this — you know you’re smart.” This usually has the opposite effect of raising the stakes and making them even more afraid of failing. Instead, **sympathize with the pressure they feel for potentially being judged**. Reassure that you’re not judging them —you care about their learning, and are proud that they’ve worked hard and continued to improve.

### Messages About Failure

**Society tells parents that the way to boost children’s self-esteem is to protect them from failure** — for instance, by minimizing a loss or blaming the coach or teacher. This might make children feel better temporarily, but it’s harmful in the long run because they don’t learn to handle life’s inevitable setbacks. They react poorly to feedback, saying it undermines their confidence, and want only to hear about how talented they are.

**Growth-minded parents take an interest in their child’s failure**, seeing it as an opportunity to learn. They don’t get upset or concerned about the child’s ability, or whitewash the failure.

Imagine how you might respond when your nine-year-old daughter, a budding gymnast, performs reasonably well at her first gymnastics meet but doesn’t win a ribbon. She’s crushed because she was confident she’d win. Here are typical, but fixed-mindset, ways to console her:

- Tell her you thought she was the best (this is a lie and she knows it).
- Tell her the judges were unfair and she should’ve gotten a ribbon (this blames others).
- Tell her gymnastics isn’t that important (sends the message that if you’re not great at something new immediately, it’s not worth pursuing).
- Tell her she has the talent and will win next time (talent will get you where you want to go).
- Tell her she didn’t deserve to win because she didn’t practice enough (this could be growth-minded and helpful, if it were said in a different way).

Here’s how a growth-minded father actually responded in the above scenario. He told her he understands how disappointing it is when you have high hopes and do your best but don’t win. However, he also pointed out that **she hadn’t really _earned_ a win yet**, since she was just starting in gymnastics and had a lot to learn. Other girls on the team had worked harder and longer. She’d have to do the same if she really wanted to excel. He told her that doing a sport just for fun is fine too, but excelling requires a higher level of commitment. With this feedback, the girl worked harder, especially on weaknesses, and won five ribbons and was overall champion at a bigger competition.

#### How to Give Constructive Feedback

Everyone thinks the criticism they give their children is constructive. But while they intend it to be helpful, often it isn’t. **To be constructive, criticism must help a child fix something or do something better**. Most often, what they hear from parents isn’t constructive — it’s judgmental.

For example, when a child does incomplete or sloppy work, a frustrated parent might say, “You mean _this_ is all you can do? Are you stupid or lazy?”

Instead, constructive or growth-oriented criticism would sound like, “It upsets me when you don’t finish an assignment. When can you finish this?” Or, “This looks like an assignment that requires a lot of concentration and effort. Let’s talk about how you apply concentration skills.”

#### Discipline

When parents judge and punish children, they’re usually trying to teach them something — but children may learn an unintended lesson. For instance, when parents punish a child for doing something wrong (making a bad decision), they’re teaching the child not to go against the parents’ rules and wishes. Instead, what they should be teaching is **how to think through a situation and make a better decision next time**. Growth-oriented parents set high standards _and_ teach children how to meet them rather than judging and punishing them for falling short.

#### Extreme Expectations

It’s natural for parents to have high aspirations for their children, but sometimes parents allow their desires to take precedence over what’s best for the child or what the child wants.

For example, Mark was exceptional in math and wanted to go to Stuyvesant High School for its advanced math curriculum. But his parents made him go to a different school because they’d heard that it would be hard for him to get into Harvard from Stuyvesant. They didn’t care about his interests, only about theirs. They wanted him to succeed, but on their terms. Their message was, “We’ll love you only if you go to Harvard.”

Many children pick up this type of message. Researchers studied children age six to college-age and found that **those with fixed mindsets believed they had to fulfill their parents’ expectations in order to be loved and respected.**

John McEnroe’s father put tremendous pressure on him to excel at tennis when he discovered the boy was good at it. As a result of the pressure, McEnroe didn’t enjoy playing tennis. He liked being at the top for the money and fame, but he never liked the sport.

In contrast, Tiger Woods’ father, although ambitious, fostered his son’s love of golf and raised him to focus on growth and learning. He once said he’d have been happy if his son had chosen another occupation, such as being a plumber, as long as he applied himself.

When parents force fixed-mindset ideals and aspirations on their children, they eliminate any room for failures or for their child’s individuality. However, when they adopt a growth mindset and encourage their children’s development of interests or passions, neither will be disappointed.

### Mindset for Teachers

Along with growth-oriented parents, children need growth-minded teachers and coaches to help them learn to develop and succeed. Famous teachers Marva Collins and Rafe Esquith taught from a growth mindset. They believed in the growth of ability and intellect, and they loved both learning and fostering development and learning in their students. **They created a nurturing environment in which they emphasized standards and hard work.**

#### Hard Work

Marva Collins taught Chicago children who had reached a dead end. For instance, one boy had attended thirteen schools in four years and another had been kicked out of a mental health center. On her first day, Collins told the students: ‘Welcome to success. But success is not coming to you, you must come to it.”

Her students worked all day with only a short lunch break. They wrote every day and, as their skills grew, they tackled increasingly difficult material. When _60 Minutes_ did a program on the school, the children expressed pride in working hard. One student told reporter Mike Wallace that he liked the hard work “because it makes your brain bigger.”

Similarly, Rafe Esquith taught Los Angeles second graders form high-crime areas. Many had family members with drug, alcohol, and emotional problems, so the children didn’t get much support at home. To emphasize the value of effort, Esquith regularly reminded them of how much they’d learned and how difficult concepts had gotten easier with practice. He told them he wasn’t any smarter than they were, but knew more because he worked at learning. His motto was, “There are no shortcuts.”

#### Standards and Nurturing

Collins set extremely high standards.

For instance, three- and four-year-olds used a vocabulary book for high school students; seven-year-olds read The Wall Street Journal. However, she also created an atmosphere of love and concern. She also told the children she would love them even when they didn’t love themselves.

A caring, nonjudgmental learning environment is important for performance. Researchers who studied 102 high-achieving musicians, artists, athletes, and mathematicians found that their first teachers were warm, accepting, and committed to teaching them.

Like Collins, Esquith maintained an atmosphere of affection and personal commitment to his students, while setting high standards. He decried what he viewed as slipping standards in many schools, noting that educators don’t help children when they gloss over deficiencies — they consign them to continued failure and a lifetime of low-wage jobs. His fifth grade reading assignments included: _Of Mice and Men, Native Son, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, A Separate Peace, and To Kill a Mockingbird_. He required his sixth graders to pass an algebra final that eighth and ninth graders in most schools would struggle with.

Besides setting high standards, growth-minded teachers show students how to meet them. Collins didn’t just tell her students to read Shakespeare’s _MacBeth_. She and her students read and talked about each line together. Esquith spent considerable time planning passages for each student to read in class, so that a shy child would succeed and a more advanced student would be challenged. He met with students before and after school and even on vacation. His goal was for students to be able to learn and think on their own.

### Mindset for Coaches

Coaches are teachers too, but their students’ failures and successes are more public. **The mindset they bring to the job can have an enormous impact on student athletes’ success on the field and in life.**

Contrast two famous college basketball coaches: Bobby Knight, a fixed-mindset coach; and John Wooden a growth-minded coach.

#### Bobby Knight: No Mistakes

Indiana college basketball coach Bobby Knight had a fixed mindset and could be extremely harsh. He took every defeat personally, feeling that it made him a failure and ruined his identity as a superior coach. He demanded perfect games. He couldn’t tolerate mistakes and was legendary for blowing up on the court.

Knight was so obsessed with winning that he humiliated players who contributed to losses. For instance, when the team lost, he prohibited those who’d played poorly from traveling home with the rest of the team. Instead of improving under his guidance, some players succumbed to his humiliations and lost their love for the sport. He motivated players through fear. He claimed to be trying to toughen them up, but he was using them to validate his greatness.

Some players escaped by transferring to other schools or going early to the pros. Even his best player, Isaiah Thomas, was ambivalent. He said there were times he wanted to hug Knight and times he’d have shot him if he’d had a gun.

#### John Wooden: Give Your All

UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, winner of 10 NCAA championships, was Knight’s polar opposite in coaching style and philosophy. His strategy was constant training in basic skills, conditioning, and adopting a new mindset. As a growth-oriented coach, **he demanded that each player commit himself to improving a little each day**, which would add up to great improvement over time. While Knight’s goal was a perfect game, Wooden’s was that each player be fully prepared and give full effort. He didn’t accept laziness or coasting and would end practice if players weren’t trying hard. His philosophy was that when you do your best, you might be outscored, but you won’t lose.

Wooden wasn’t the best when it came to strategy, but he excelled at understanding and motivating his players. For him, helping them fulfill their potential, not just in basketball but in life, was more rewarding than winning games. Years later, players expressed appreciation for the values he taught, which they applied throughout their lives. None of them had thought about shooting him.

### Misconceptions About Growth Mindset

Some parents, coaches, and teachers who want to do the right things for children nonetheless misunderstand or misapply the growth mindset. It’s deceptively simple — a growth mindset means believing people can develop their abilities. This chapter looks at some misconceptions and explains how to start developing a growth mindset and pass it on to children.

**Misconception #1: Having a growth mindset means being open-minded.** People who are flexible and open-minded often think they have a growth mindset. They sometimes call it an open mindset. But being open-minded is different than being committed to developing your own and other people’s abilities, which is hard work rather than simply a commendable attitude.

**Misconception #2: A growth mindset is only about effort, especially praising effort**. It’s much broader than that. Effort is important but it’s part of a process of growth that also includes **effective learning strategies, focus, perseverance, and asking for help when you need it**. Progress and learning come from the whole process, not just effort or one of the other components.

There are several pitfalls to praising effort alone, rather than the development process:

- Some people praise any effort at all, even when it’s minimal, which sends the wrong message about what it takes to succeed.
- Some teachers and coaches praise kids when they try but make little progress, in other words, when they’re not learning. Acknowledging the effort isn’t enough — parents or teachers need to determine why the effort isn’t working and help the child find better strategies so they can start learning again.

**Misconception #3: The growth mindset means praising the process**. You should praise the process, but also connect it to the outcome — what children have learned, progress they’ve made, or specific achievements. The message to children needs to be that the process enabled them to achieve their goals.

**Misconception #4: A growth mindset means telling children they’re capable of doing anything**. This doesn’t help kids grow. It puts the responsibility for learning entirely on them. The way to help children grow is by showing them how to develop the skills to move toward their goals.

Beware of overpraising. Also, don’t criticize children for having a fixed mindset. It’s your responsibility to teach a growth mindset and help children develop.

**Grow Your Mindset: Tips**

- Your works and actions send children a message. Think about what they’re likely to hear, rather than what you intended to say.
- When a child accomplishes something, try to focus on how they did it (the entire process including effort, strategies, perseverance, and seeking help when needed).
- Think about the goals you set for your children — are you focusing on their talent or on developing their skills and knowledge through effort? Are you putting your aspirations ahead of the child’s interests?
- Teachers: use the growth mindset to set high standards, but also teach students how to reach them.
- Coaches: don’t demand perfection from your players, which is demotivating. Emphasize commitment and diligent effort.
