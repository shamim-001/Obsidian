## Chapters 17-18: The Final Lessons

The final two chapters of the _Gita_ are devoted to answering Arjuna’s remaining questions and wrapping up the conversation. In Chapter 17, Arjuna asks for more details about scriptures. Specifically, he wants to know what happens to people who worship faithfully, but not in the ways that are prescribed in the scriptures.

Chapter 18 reiterates that the way to find everlasting peace is by maintaining faith in Vishnu, devoting your life and all of your actions to him, and detaching from your ego. **This is, as Krishna has said many times throughout the _Gita_, the ultimate goal of life.**

### Worship Influenced by the Gunas

Following up on Krishna’s last lesson, Arjuna asks about people who worship faithfully but don’t follow the rituals prescribed by scripture. He wonders which guna they’re acting from by doing so.

Krishna answers that every living creature has some kind of faith, which could come from any of the three gunas. What kind of faith someone has depends on which guna he or she is ruled by, which also impacts every aspect of that person’s life. Krishna specifically discusses what each type of worship focuses on, and what each type of person likes to eat, which taken together give insights into the kinds of people that they are.

**Sattvic worship focuses on God, in all of the many forms he takes.** People ruled by sattva like to eat mild, healthy food that fuels them without causing damage to the body. Like their food, their worship is also straightforward and designed to promote good health. They make offerings with their minds focused on the ultimate purpose: worshipping God. They don’t think about rewards or social standing, they simply perform their spiritual duties.

**Rajasic worship focuses on wealth and power.** People ruled by rajas like food with strong flavors—spicy, salty, bitter, or sour. However, such food ends up causing them pain, and even sickness. Just like they eat with the intention of indulging themselves, they worship for selfish reasons as well—to make a show of it, or because they hope to be rewarded for their faith.

**Tamasic worship focuses on ghosts and spirits, rather than any form of God.** They worship without any true faith, and don’t even follow the proper rituals. Tamasic worship may be practiced in order to gain power over one’s followers, or in the misguided belief that torturing one’s body is spiritual. Like their worship, their food has no purpose nor value—people ruled by tamas like food that has been overcooked, or that has gone stale; food that’s lost its flavor and nutrition.

Finally, Krishna says that there are three different types of self-discipline, each of which can be practiced according to any of the three gunas as previously described—but _should_ be practiced according to sattva. The physical disciplines are service, worship, self-control, and peace. The disciplines of speech are honesty and kindness, and studying the scriptures. The mental disciplines are gentleness, calmness, and restraint.

#### The Name of Brahman

Krishna ends this lesson by reciting the sacred name _Om Tat Sat. **While the three words together represent Brahman, each has its own powerful and important meaning.**_

Om is the oldest Hindu _mantram_—a short phrase that is repeated many times over to focus the mind and spirit. It’s a holy syllable that represents Brahman and is meant to be the sacred sound that one can hear while deep in meditation. Those who follow scripture always use this mantra while making offerings, giving gifts, and performing other spiritual duties.

Tat simply means “that,” but represents the ultimate reality: the truth of God and the universe that no one can possibly imagine or describe. Worshippers will add the word Tat to indicate that they’re performing these actions to free themselves from karma, rather than for any immediate personal benefit.

Sat means, simultaneously, “what is” and “what is good.” It describes an admirable or honest deed. On the other hand, engaging in spiritual practices in bad faith would be _asat_, without goodness. Worshipping for selfish reasons has no value, in this life or any life to come.

**Taken together, the phrase Om Tat Sat means that _only good is real._** Evil, like sense-objects, is temporary and false.

### The Kinds of Renunciation

Now starting to wrap up his lesson, Krishna returns to one of the _Gita’_s earliest topics: renunciation of actions, called _sannyasa_, and renunciation of the results of those actions, called _tyaga_. Krishna reiterates that sannyasa, completely giving up on taking any actions at all, isn’t a proper spiritual path, and it’s impossible besides; as long as you have a body, you’ll have physical needs that you must see to.

**He’s more interested in tyaga and goes into detail about three ways to practice it according to the three gunas.** Simply renouncing all of your duties and responsibilities is tamasic tyaga, which will only degrade your spiritual health. Renouncing only those actions that you think will be difficult or unpleasant is rajasic tyaga, driven by selfishness and lacking in any spiritual value.

**However, fulfilling your obligations without any thought of selfish rewards—doing your duty simply because it is your duty—is sattvic, and this is the best form of tyaga.** Sattvic tyaga will bring you closer to God.

#### What’s Needed for Action

Since actions must be performed, Krishna now explains the five things that are needed for every act that anyone performs, whether good or bad:

1. The physical body
2. The means to perform the act
3. The sense of self
4. The actual performance of the action
5. The divine will that drives it

People who don’t fully understand these five elements think that they are the ones performing actions, but those with spiritual wisdom understand that they are only vessels through which the divine will acts. While awareness of oneself is needed to take any action, that action should not be taken _for_ oneself. Everything should be done in service to God.

In addition to the five elements that are needed to perform an action, three things determine when and how people take action: the concept of knowledge, the things that are known, and the one who knows them. Without these things, people wouldn’t know when it was appropriate to take action, or what actions to take.

The action itself can also be broken down into three aspects: the means to perform the act (which is both part of the action and part of what’s needed to do the action), the action itself, and the one doing the action.

#### Action Driven by Gunas

These deconstructions are important because **the knowledge to perform the action, the action, and the one doing the action can all be affected by, and described in terms of, the three gunas**.

Sattvic knowledge is what Krishna has been explaining throughout the _Gita_—that there is a single, divine entity living in all things, and therefore all things are connected and unified. Sattvic understanding knows right from wrong, what will bring security and peace, and what will ultimately lead to freedom and union with God.

As Krishna has said before, acting selflessly to fulfill one’s obligations—one’s dharma—is the proper way to take action. This is sattvic action. Sattvic actors are selfless, unconcerned with payment or reward, and equally happy in good times and hard times.

Rajasic knowledge is selfish; it doesn’t see the unity in everything but considers different things and creatures as separate entities. Because it lacks this crucial understanding, rajasic intellect can’t tell right from wrong. It pursues wealth, pleasure, and good reputation, often at the expense of others.

Rajasic action is also selfish, done in the hopes of personal gain, and often causes undue stress on the actor. Rajasic actors are greedy and destructive, and they’re obsessed with their ever-shifting fortunes.

Tamasic knowledge is deluded—like a child, it sees one small part of the world and thinks that’s all there is, with no concept that there could be something beyond its own experiences. It’s even more confused than rajasic knowledge and mixes up right and wrong at every turn. It leads to fear, grief, sadness, and a refusal to learn from mistakes.

Tamasic action is ignorant and thoughtless, done without any consideration of dharma, the impact it will have on others, or even one’s own ability to do it. Tamasic actors are lazy, undisciplined, and dishonest. They often procrastinate on their work or shirk it entirely.

#### The Three Kinds of Happiness

**Like everything else, you can even describe happiness in terms of the gunas.** Happiness that comes from sattvic knowledge and action is hard to find at first. Working without any thought or hope of personal reward will seem bitter and pointless until you come to fully understand how you’re fulfilling dharma and helping the world through your actions. However, sattvic happiness is the only type of happiness that brings lasting joy and peace.

Happiness that comes from the guna of rajas is immediate and pleasurable, but temporary. It’s the joy of getting something you’ve always wanted, or the thrill of eating a piece of spicy food. It fades quickly and reveals itself to be an illusion—remember, only that which is permanent and unchanging is real.

Tamasic happiness is a lie from beginning to end. It comes from idleness, sleep, and intoxication. This kind of false happiness should be avoided at all costs.

### Krishna’s Final Lesson

Krishna’s final lesson to Arjuna reiterates one of his first lessons: **Every person should seek to fulfill his or her own destiny, and not chase after anyone else’s.** By doing one’s own duties as best as possible, and devoting every action to God, it’s possible to break free of samsara and reach God’s true home, to be reunited with him forever.

Krishna is circling back around to this point because the great battle of the _Mahabharata_ is about to begin, and he wants to make sure that Arjuna is ready for it. He warns that, even if Arjuna tries to stay out of the battle, his karma and his own nature as a kshatriya—a warrior and a leader—will force him into the fight. The key for Arjuna is to understand that he isn’t going out there to fight for himself, but because he’s a vessel for divine will and destiny.

Finally, Krishna tells Arjuna to share what he’s learned, but only with those who are ready to receive the lessons. Anyone who’s lacking in devotion, discipline, or the desire to learn isn’t worthy of learning what Krishna has taught Arjuna throughout the _Bhagavad Gita_. **However, teaching the divine mysteries to those who _are_ ready to receive them is the greatest act of love and devotion that one can perform.**

Krishna signals that their conversation is coming to an end. He asks whether Arjuna has been listening and whether his teachings have dispelled Arjuna’s doubts. Arjuna replies that he’s freed from his uncertainties and misunderstandings. He vows to carry out Krishna’s will.

#### Sanjaya’s Prediction

Sanjaya, who has been observing Arjuna and Krishna’s conversation and reporting what he hears to king Dhritarashtra, says that he is overwhelmed and overjoyed to have heard the divine mysteries directly from Krishna himself. He also reveals that he saw the divine vision of Krishna’s true, infinite form—something that supposedly only Arjuna had seen.

Sanjaya predicts that, in spite of the Kauravas’ much larger army, the Pandavas will win the battle with Arjuna and Krishna leading them. **He says that anywhere Krishna and Arjuna are, there is certain to be victory, happiness, wealth, and wisdom.** That final prediction marks the end of the _Bhagavad Gita_.
