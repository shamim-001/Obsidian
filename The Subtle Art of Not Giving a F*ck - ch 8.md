## Chapter 8: Value—Practicing Rejection

Our culture tells us to always be positive and accepting of everything—to always say _yes_. However, Manson argues, **if you value everything equally, then you really have no values at all.** Therefore, you must also practice rejection—saying _no_ to all those things that don’t align with your values or further your goals. It comes back to giving a f_ck about some things and choosing to not give a f_ck about others.

The idea of narrowing our options to be happy may be counterintuitive, but Manson believes that **meaning in life comes from caring a lot about a few select things.**

### Why Less Is More

Manson claims that we actually tend to be happier with less; the more options we have, the less satisfied we are with the options we choose, because we keep thinking of the ones we didn’t choose. You keep wondering if you’d be happier with a different choice. Psychologists call this the paradox of choice. When faced with an overabundance of options, some people delay making a choice in order to keep their options open as long as possible, or they avoid commitment.

(Shortform note: Further studies have shown that the Paradox of Choice [may not be as straightforward](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/is-the-famous-paradox-of-choic) as experts once thought. While it’s true that having too many choices often leads to stress and difficulty making decisions, **in some circumstances the opposite is true.** For instance, someone who’s an expert on a subject will prefer having more choices available, such as a computer whiz looking at parts for a new PC.)

He adds that, when you continually chase new experiences, you experience diminishing returns—you gain less satisfaction from each additional experience. The same principle applies to acquiring possessions, hobbies, partners, jobs, and friends.

The older and more experienced you get, the less significantly such things affect you when compared to your total experiences. Therefore, Manson urges you to **focus on the people and experiences that bring you the most satisfaction, and reject those that don’t make the cut.** He adds that it’s good to practice rejection; say “no” to those unneeded trips, possessions, hobbies, and people.

However, Manson also provides a counterpoint to his own argument: Experiencing as many different things as possible _can_ be helpful when you’re young and trying to determine where your interests lie.

> Recall the _[hedonic treadmill](https://dictionary.apa.org/hedonic-treadmill)_ that we discussed in Chapter 2: **Constantly chasing happiness actually makes us feel worse, because it highlights that we _aren’t_ happy.** Also consider the [Set Point Theory of Happiness](https://www.apa.org/monitor/dec07/happiness), which states that people have a “baseline” happiness level that they’ll always return to, even after life-changing events like a promotion or a divorce.
> 
> Both of these theories effectively say the same thing: It’s impossible to make ourselves happy just by getting things that we want (including experiences, relationships, and so on). Therefore, it would be better to say “no” to those things and devote ourselves to what will really make us happy—which, according to Manson, is progress and personal growth.

Rather than following the cultural dictate to keep pursuing a broad range of things or experiences, Manson says that you should **focus on a narrower range of things and depth of experience**. Prioritize quality over quantity. Here’s why:

- **Commitment to less brings you freedom**. It allows you to focus on what’s most important to you and achieve more than you would if your efforts were scattered.
- Commitment makes decision-making easier and **dispels the fear that by choosing you’re going to miss out**. When you’re committed to something, you don’t need to keep pursuing more.

> **Finding Your Focus**
> 
> In _[Designing Your Life](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/designing-your-life/chapter-9)_, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans suggest the following process for figuring out what you should commit to:
> 
> - **Make a list.** Identify and list all of the options you have available for whatever situation you’re trying to figure out.
>     
> - **Categorize your list.** Group those options by theme. Within each theme, list the relevant options in order of how much they interest you (most interesting at the top, least interesting at the bottom). Cross out every option except the top one or two from each theme.
>     
> - **Discern which option is right for you.** They use the word _discern_ instead of _decide_ to emphasize that this process isn’t purely thought-based. Listen to your instincts, your emotions, and even the physical sensations you feel when considering each option.
>     
>     - Many of us aren’t in tune with our instincts and feelings, because we’ve been taught to disregard or suppress them. If you find that you’re having trouble hearing what they’re saying, you might try to explore them through a reflective practice like journaling or meditation.
> - **If applicable, test your new choice.** Live as if you’d fully committed to your decision; both your thoughts and your actions should reflect your new commitment as much as possible. After 2-3 days, you should have a good sense of whether it’s the right choice for you.
>     
>     - During this trial period, pay attention to your mindset, your feelings, and your body; all the same things you used to help discern this option in the first place.
> - **Let go of the other options.** If your trial period leaves you feeling good about your decision, commit to it and put the other options out of your mind. Cross them off your list, throw the list away, or do whatever you have to do to affirm your commitment to the choice you’ve made.
>     

### Rejection Is a Social Skill

As we’ve discussed, Manson believes that rejection is an integral part of committing ourselves to our core values. He also says that, in a different way, **rejection is essential in building healthy personal and love relationships.**

Rejection is a social skill that everyone needs to learn. People try to avoid being rejected or rejecting others because it makes them feel bad. But, if you don’t practice rejection, you’ll get stuck in situations that make you unhappy—the very thing that you were trying to avoid in the first place.

- Trying to avoid rejecting or confronting anyone and to accept everything is a form of entitlement. Entitled people believe they should feel good all of the time; rejection feels bad, so they avoid it. As a result, they become self-absorbed and lack values.
- Avoiding rejection (both being rejected and doing the rejecting) can make us feel better temporarily, but it isn’t the way to have a meaningful life.

(Shortform note: Robert Cialdini’s book _[Influence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/influence)_ explains that we avoid rejection because our brains are hardwired to avoid downsides—which we subconsciously perceive as danger—over seeking upsides. Thus, we don’t ask for things that we want (or say no to things that we don’t want) because of the potential downside of rejection.)

Therefore, Manson concludes, practicing rejection strengthens our relationships. **When we’re comfortable saying no and getting no for an answer, that means our relationship is based on honesty and openness.**

> Psychotherapist Amy Morin, author of _[13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do,](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/13-things-mentally-strong-people-dont-do-amy-morin?variant=32207570468898)_ writes that people who avoid rejection (who avoid both rejecting others and being rejected themselves) [often suffer from a lack of self-worth](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201708/10-signs-youre-people-pleaser).
> 
> Such people feel the need to be accepted and liked—in other words, they get their sense of worth from other people—and rejection in any form can cause them intense anxiety. As a result, “people-pleasers” tend to rate others’ needs more highly than their own. This can lead to self-destructive behavior, as the people-pleaser sacrifices his or her own health for the sake of others.
> 
> Morin recommends **breaking out of people-pleasing habits by starting small:**
> 
> - Say no to something unimportant, like a small project or a dinner date you don’t want to go to.
>     
> - Give your honest opinion about something simple, like a popular movie you didn’t care for.
>     
> - Stand up for something you believe in—while not as trivial as the other options, it may help if you have the “courage of your convictions,” as they say.
>     

#### Rejection in Love Relationships

Manson warns that **an inability or unwillingness to practice rejection leads to unhealthy love relationships.** It blurs the boundaries between partners when one or both assume responsibility for the other’s feelings; remember, nobody is responsible for your situation or your feelings except you. Therefore, you should _reject_ the idea that your partner’s happiness is your obligation.

To have a **healthy relationship**, there must be **firm boundaries** between the partners and their values. Each person must:

- Accept responsibility for their own problems, and refuse to take responsibility for their partner’s problems. For example, if your partner feels insecure and jealous whenever you spend time with other people, **it is not your responsibility to cater to those feelings.**
- Work on their own problems, with the other’s support.
- Be willing to both reject and be rejected by their partner.

> Manson expands on this discussion in his blog post “[The Guide to Strong Relationship Boundaries,](https://markmanson.net/boundaries#setting-boundaries)” adding that a lack of boundaries goes hand-in-hand with a lack of self-esteem. In other words, you fail to set boundaries because you don’t value yourself enough. Therefore, he says, **the best and easiest way to establish strong boundaries is to build up your self-esteem.**
> 
> However, like happiness, self-esteem isn’t something that you can pursue. Rather, self-esteem is a side effect of being a stable, capable person; the type of person that this book is trying to help you become.

Manson claims that romantic love can be like an addiction, giving temporary highs but creating long-term problems. Furthermore, he says that romance is often characterized by entitlement on the part of one or both people, leading to blurred boundaries between them. Because of these blurred boundaries, entitled people either assume responsibility for their partner’s problems, or they hold the other person responsible for their problems.

(Shortform note: In fact, love may be more like a drug than Manson realized when writing this book. When you’re in love, your brain produces large amounts of [dopamine](https://www.healthline.com/health/relationships/effects-of-love#brain-effects), which causes intense happiness much like being high. Since that feeling is associated with the person you love, you’ll start doing whatever you can to see and be around that person—much like an addict will do anything to get his next fix. That desperation for a dopamine high can contribute to blurred boundaries, since you’ll be tempted to sacrifice your own well-being for the chance to stay close to your partner.)

> The book _[Difficult Conversations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/chapter-3)_ explains that we often mistake people’s _impacts_ for their _intentions_. For example, you might assume that a harsh remark your partner made that hurt your feelings (its impact) was _meant_ to hurt you (its intention). Conversely, you may have said something harsh a moment before but didn’t intend to hurt your partner—in this case, you focus on your _intent_, instead of the _impact_ your statement had on the other person.
> 
> In short, we often assume that we have good intentions, while others have bad intentions. The way to avoid this hypocrisy is, as Manson says, to **take responsibility for your actions and your feelings.**
> 
> When you take responsibility, intentions—your own and other people’s—no longer matter to you. All that matters is _**what you did to cause the current situation**_ and **what you will do in response to it.**

##### The Mindsets of Entitled Partners

Manson believes that entitled people blame others for their problems, or accept blame or responsibility for another person’s problems, because they’re trying to feel loved. They generally fall into one of these two mindsets:

- **Victim:** If they play the role of victim, then someone will save them and they’ll feel loved.
- **Savior:** If they fix the other person, then they’ll be appreciated and loved.

He adds that victims and saviors are naturally drawn to one another, but end up unable to meet each other’s needs. That’s because they’re not in a healthy relationship; each partner is acting selfishly, using the other to get an emotional high. Furthermore, because a victim/savior relationship isn’t built on solid values, both partners are terrified that any disagreement or rejection could make the relationship fall apart—meaning that they couldn’t get their “fix” anymore.

(Shortform note: Relationships based on a victim and savior dynamic fail because of Manson’s earlier point that [you have to take responsibility for your own emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-emotional-meter/201709/the-victim-and-savior-relationship). Your feelings aren’t anyone else’s problem, and nobody else’s feelings are your problem. More to the point, other people’s feelings are totally out of your control.)

##### The Mindset of Supportive Partners

In contrast to a victim/savior relationship, Manson says that disagreements and rejections in healthy relationships might lead to bruised feelings, but the pain is short-lived. That’s because the partners **care about each other enough to work through the difficulty together,** instead of only caring about themselves.

Maintaining boundaries in a healthy relationship doesn’t mean partners don’t help and support each other; it means that **they support each other by choice,** rather than due to pressure or a feeling of obligation.

> Psychologists recommend a [four-step process for setting boundaries](https://positivepsychology.com/great-self-care-setting-healthy-boundaries/) (in any relationship, not just a romantic one):
> 
> - **Define the boundary.** This first step is just for you; you have to clearly know what boundaries you want before you can set them.
>     
> - **Explain the boundary.** Once you know what your boundary is, communicate that information to your partner (or whoever the boundary is for).
>     
> - **Keep it simple.** You don’t need to go into details or justifications. In a healthy relationship, the other person or people will respect your new boundary without demanding explanations about it.
>     
> - **Add an “or else.”** Along with your boundary, clearly lay out what the consequences will be if someone violates it. Make sure that you’re prepared to follow through with those consequences.
>     

#### Building Trust in a Relationship

Trust is a vital component in a relationship. For Manson, that means that **partners have to trust each other enough to be honest:** to say what they really think and feel and to tolerate rejection (saying no and hearing no).

According to Manson, that means being honest about even simple things—for instance, if your partner asks whether you like her new haircut, and you really don’t care for it. Many partners lie to avoid short-term discomfort in answering such questions, but honesty in a relationship is more important than feeling good in the moment. **Being honest about small things sets the stage for being honest about bigger things.**

He adds that conflict and differences also help to build trust. In fact, conflict is necessary because **when people can disagree, it means the relationship isn’t conditional or dependent on keeping one or the other happy**.

- If someone always agrees with you, they’re not being honest and you can’t trust what they say. Working out differences openly is preferable to manipulation and dissembling.
- Rejection is part of building trust. If both people in a relationship cannot say no and accept no in turn, one partner’s values and problems may dominate the relationship.

> **How to Fight Effectively**
> 
> TIME Magazine interviewed psychologists about how to productively “fight” with your partner. [They gathered the following tips:](https://time.com/5402188/how-to-fight-healthy-partner/)
> 
> - **Examine your fights.** If you find yourselves arguing about the same topics over and over, try to find what triggers those fights and figure out a way around that problem.
>     
> - **Schedule your fights.** If you start getting pulled into an argument, agree to continue it when you’ll have the time and focus to have a real discussion.
>     
>     - This also gives both partners a chance to calm down and collect their thoughts, instead of lashing out in anger.
> - **Call timeout when you or your partner needs it.** Fights are stressful, and one or both partners might drop into [“fight, flight, or freeze.”](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze) When that happens, put the argument on hold until both people are ready to continue it.
>     
>     - “Fight, flight, or freeze” is an instinctive response to danger. When one or both partners are instinctively reacting to a perceived threat from the other, it’s unlikely that they’ll be able to have a productive conversation.
> - **Ask instead of complaining.** Ask for what you want, instead of complaining that your partner isn’t meeting your needs. This approach is less confrontational and more likely to get the outcome you want.
>     
>     - For example, instead of complaining that your partner lets dirty dishes pile up, just ask him or her to wash them.
> - **Listen, and ask questions.** Listen to what your partner is saying, and ask questions to make sure you really understand what the issue is.
>     
>     - Don’t interrupt or insult each other—if the fight gets to that point, it’s time to call a timeout.
> - **Learn your partner’s apology language.** Like [love languages](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-5-love-languages/1-page-summary), people respond to different kinds of apologies differently. For example, some people want dramatic gestures, while others benefit more from a simple, contrite admission that you were wrong.
>     
>     - If the two of you have different apology languages, then trying to smooth over a conflict might just make it worse—your partner might see your dramatic gesture as insincere, or your simple apology as inadequate.

However, while conflict can work to strengthen a relationship, Manson clarifies that not _all_ conflicts are beneficial. For example, cheating destroys trust rather than strengthening it. If that trust can’t be repaired, the relationship is over.

- **People who cheat are valuing something more than the relationship.** Whatever that value is—validation or power, for instance—it’s not compatible with a healthy relationship.
- Most cheaters apologize when caught and promise never to do it again, but that won’t fix the relationship. Fixing it, if that’s even possible, is a lengthy and painful process—the cheater needs to uncover and acknowledge the value that broke the relationship, and then decide whether it or the relationship is more important.
- Next, the cheater needs to build a track record of improved behavior. It has to be a long one—trust can’t be rebuilt without time and painful struggle.

> In his blog post [“Why People Cheat in Relationships,”](https://markmanson.net/why-people-cheat) Manson offers another explanation: People cheat when their **need for self-gratification** is greater than the **satisfaction they get from their relationship.** Thus, according to Manson, there are two reasons why people cheat:
> 
> - **They aren’t mature enough to delay their gratification for a larger goal.** In other words, they value the immediate pleasure they get from cheating more than they value a healthy, long-term relationship with a loving partner.
>     
> - **An unhappy relationship.** Manson argues that it’s common sense that people are more likely to cheat if the relationship is already miserable.
>     
> 
> In short, Manson is still saying that people cheat because there’s something that they value more than the relationship; however, he’s adding the important point that it might be because the relationship isn’t very valuable to the cheater.

This process applies to repairing any relationship where trust has been broken: The transgressor owns up to the values that led to the rift and proves he or she values the relationship through improved behavior over time.

Manson adds that you might be able to repair one breach of trust. However, **if trust is broken again, the relationship is damaged even further and may be beyond repair.**

(Shortform note: As Maya Angelou famously said, [“When people show you who they are, believe them.”](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oprah-life-lesson-maya-angelou_n_2869235) Repairing a relationship is difficult because one person now needs to overturn the other’s belief about who he or she is. Damaging the relationship again, especially in the same way, may cement that belief forever.)
