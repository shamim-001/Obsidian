## Chapter 11: Effective Decision-Making

This chapter brings together the previous principles of total receptivity, honesty, transparency, productive conflict, letting the best ideas win regardless of source, a systematic approach, and the right people into a process that helps you arrive at the best decisions.

While each situation has unique particularities, Dalio describes general principles for any decision. He writes that there are only two main steps to making a decision: learning and deciding. We’ll explore each of these in detail in this chapter.

### Learn Well

Dalio says that the foundation of decision-making is gathering information from credible sources. To do this, you need to be receptive and open to productive conflict (both of which were discussed in previous chapters).

To make sense of all the information you receive, you should use each piece of information appropriately. Dalio says you shouldn’t treat all information equally, because some information is more important than others, and some people are more credible than others in a given topic area. You also shouldn’t mistake opinions for facts.

(Shortform note: When you receive an overwhelming amount of information, it can be hard to tell which pieces of information are more important than others. Try to [filter everything using a hierarchy of knowledge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemyatt/2012/03/28/6-tips-for-making-better-decisions/?sh=387f18b834dc): first, your **gut instincts** or intuition, which you might need to trust even in the face of data; second, **information**, or your collection of data; and third, **knowledge**, or the information after analyzing data.)

#### Understand the Situation

Dalio says that any important decisions you make for a situation should put you on an upward trajectory at the right pace, so that you can reach your goals within a reasonable amount of time. To make those decisions, you should have a good understanding of the situation, with a clear view of the factors and realities at play. This means you need to:

##### 1) Get an Overview of the Situation and How You Got There

Compare your overview against your desired trajectory. Some people make the mistake of just looking at what’s currently happening without considering the context, and then making decisions from there. This leads to poor outcomes.

For example, you might look at rising sales figures and think that you’re doing great, and consequently decide to keep doing what you’ve been doing. On the other hand, if you look at your performance over time and compare it against your ideal trajectory, you might see that sales are rising _too slowly_ to make a significant impact. This discovery should lead to a different decision altogether.

(Shortform note: Aside from taking a big-picture view of your metrics, you might also need to reevaluate them to see if they’re measuring anything meaningful. [Check if you’re mistakenly using vanity metrics](https://hbr.org/2013/03/know-the-difference-between-yo), or numbers that look great on paper but that don’t really do anything for your organization.)

##### 2) Look at the Situation on Multiple Levels of Detail

Dalio says that reality isn’t just a random pile of facts. Instead, it’s made up of interconnected levels of detail with a greater logic: There is a top level of the most important points, as well as lower levels of supporting detail. You need to be clear about the level you’re deciding on and understand that the decision should be consistent across all levels.

For example, if you’re deciding to start a small business, your levels might be:

- Level 1 (the top level of detail): your purpose
- Level 2: your desired job to fulfill that purpose
- Level 3: the kind of education you need to get that job
- Level 4: the grades you need to get into your ideal college
- Level 5: what you should do to get the grades you need

If you make a decision to put little effort into getting good grades, it will naturally affect the levels above it. You can’t make a different decision at Level 5 and expect nothing to change in the higher levels.

(Shortform note: Just because decision-making has levels, it doesn’t mean that the process is linear, where you simply make changes at one level and then move on to the next. Instead, [decision-making is a circular process](https://hbr.org/2021/04/11-myths-about-decision-making): As you obtain new information, you have to circle back and compare it against the information you already have, and analyze this old information through a new lens. For example, when deciding on a university, you don’t just look at one school and make a decision. You explore various universities to adequately compare them and find the best fit based on your objectives, capabilities, and resources.)

##### 3) Focus on the Rules, Not the Exceptions

Looking at each situation from different levels can be time-consuming, but you can use what Dalio calls a “by and large” approach: Don’t get obsessed with details that don’t really matter and lose sight of what’s really important. **_Informed approximations_ can already lead to effective decisions.**

(Shortform note: In a review of _Principles_, _[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/life-and-work-codied-at-last-1506889007)_ calls attention to the [contradictions in the book](https://www.wsj.com/articles/life-and-work-codied-at-last-1506889007), including how Dalio advocates focusing on the details while also championing being imprecise (or using the “by and large” approach). You can reconcile these two principles by focusing on important details and not getting caught up in irrelevant ones.)

### Decide Well

Once you’ve gathered relevant information from credible sources, you can make a decision. Dalio outlines five principles for making good decisions:

#### 1) Systematize Your Decision-Making

Dalio believes that what hurts good decision-making the most is emotions, so it’s best to automate decisions as much as you can. This means using the same timeless and universal principles to decide on situations that fall within the same category.

Ideally, you can convert your principles into algorithms and have a computer decide alongside you. Here’s how:

- Write down your principles for making decisions in both words and algorithms.
- Back-test your algorithms with previous data to make sure they would have made good decisions in the past.
- Use the algorithms in real time, in parallel with your thinking brain.

(Shortform note: If it’s unclear what algorithms are, think of an “if-then” statement. For example, “If I receive enough money to pay my bills, I will save 20% of what remains in my retirement account. If I don’t, I will pay my highest interest bills first, then try to cut down my spending.” Having clear rules like this gives you an easy way to make decisions without thinking hard, from scratch, each time.)

If the rules and algorithms you use for decision-making lead to the wrong output, Dalio explains, the weightings or rules need to be changed. (Shortform note: For example, think of how you spend your time. Is your time optimally allocated among the activities that will help you best meet your goals? If not, then what is causing you to spend your time this way? Designing the rules that govern how you spend your time will improve how your machine works.)

#### 2) Never Take the First Available Option

Sometimes it appears you only have a choice between two difficult options, or they each trade off something that is unnegotiable. But as Dalio’s experience has shown, you don’t have to settle for either option and can instead look for a novel solution—for example, you can have a fund that has high returns _and_ low risk.

(Shortform note: When presented with an option that doesn’t seem attractive, sometimes all you need to do is to look at it from a different angle—reframing might make that option more desirable. Research shows that when one scenario is presented in two different ways, [people tend to go for the option that focuses on gains](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426021-100-top-10-ways-to-make-better-decisions/). For example, given a choice between a snack that’s 90% fat free and 10% fat, we’re more likely to choose the first option.)

#### 3) Weigh Second- and Third-Order Consequences

Every action has a direct “first-order” consequence, as well as longer-term second- and third-order consequences. Dalio urges you to think of the consequences as a series of dominoes, one triggering another. Some of the hardest habits to adopt have painful short-term first-order consequences but fantastic second- and third-order consequences. **Don’t let short-term first-order consequences deter you from reaching the real goals.** It’s worth enduring the shorter-term pain for the longer-term gain.

- For example, saving money has the first-order consequence of deducting money from your account that you can’t spend today. This is painful, but the second-order effect is you have more money saved for retirement. The third-order effect is even better—with more money saved, you feel less stress about your career and might have more options for how you spend your time.

> **How to Process Second-Order Consequences**
> 
> You may ignore second-order consequences because you think they’re too unpredictable and too complicated. But using [second-order thinking can keep you from making disastrous decisions](https://medium.com/@noahmp/second-order-thinking-3fc2a224b131). To help simplify the process, try asking yourself the following questions:
> 
> - What are the different probable outcomes?
>     
> - Which one is the most likely?
>     
> - What are the chances that I’m right?
>     
> - What do others think?
>     
> - How does my thinking differ from theirs?
>     

#### 4) Make Expected Value Calculations

By “expected value calculations,” Dalio means assessing all your options to determine which gives you the **highest expected value**. Many people shy away from options that have possible downsides and take very safe options, even though the safe options don’t have the highest expected value. **Don’t reject an option just because there’s something wrong with it—instead consider the gains.**

- Every option has a probability and reward for being right, and a probability and penalty for being wrong. The important thing is to figure out what those probabilities are, then choose the one that will give you the best return. Note that Dalio says it’s okay to take a chance when the chances of success are low but the upside is very high, as long as the downside is low.

> **How Successful Companies Make Value Calculations**
> 
> Dalio believes it’s OK to take chances as long as you increase your chances of winning and your bets aren’t big enough to put the entire organization at risk. Other successful companies employ a similar tactic of taking calculated risks through a [“bullets-before-cannonballs”](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/great-by-choice/chapter-4) approach. Jim Collins describes this approach in _[Great by Choice](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/great-by-choice)_:
> 
> - **First, successful companies fire “bullets.”** These are small-scale projects that serve as an experiment.
>     
> - **Then, they concentrate their firepower into “cannonballs.”** Companies use data from the small-scale projects to tell them which ones have the biggest potential for success. Once they determine the bullets that hit the mark, the companies launch bigger-scale projects in the same direction.
>     
> 
> In contrast, unsuccessful companies take an all-or-nothing approach, firing uncalibrated cannonballs that expose them to huge risks.

#### 5) Get Past Disagreements

Dalio says that principles are the true basis for disagreements between people. Rather than argue about the conclusions both of you have, argue about the principles that each of you used to arrive at your conclusions. If both of you agree on the principles, then you should also agree on the decision.

(Shortform note: It can be argued that people who start from the same place can still arrive at different conclusions. One study found that [73 teams that tested the same hypothesis and started with the same data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350362513_Observing_Many_Researchers_using_the_Same_Data_and_Hypothesis_Reveals_a_Hidden_Universe_of_Data_Analysis) produced a wide range of conclusions. This demonstrates that analysis is a highly complex process that isn’t always as straightforward as just following the same principles, as Dalio suggests.)

Dalio writes that many leaders see disagreements as disloyalty and would rather people just follow orders. But great leaders prefer to have good challengers to stress-test their ideas. Being the only person thinking is not the optimal way to succeed. However, this can go the other way, with too many voices weighing in. Even if you use credibility-centered decision making (discussed in Part 1) to resolve disagreements, some lingering resentment may remain. Here’s how to deal with it:

**Don’t leave important conflicts unresolved**—escalate the conflict to a higher authority, or put it to a vote. (Shortform note: Generally, you should allow employees to deal with disagreements on their own, but [step in if it leads to changes in behavior](https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2014/05/15/conflict-resolution-when-should-leaders-step-in/?sh=27465aa13357), reduced productivity, and increased stress.)

**Don’t let little disagreements divide you** when big agreements should bring you together. Use the “by and large” approach—overall, you have good relationships, so don’t focus on inconsequential details. (Shortform note: Sometimes, _not_ having disagreements can be divisive, because it might mean people are avoiding difficult topics. According to _[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team)_, this artificial harmony may signal a lack of trust and may lead to problems like wrong decisions, passive-aggressive behavior, or unresolved issues.)

**Dalio believes that every event has happened before,** so you can make predictions and plans based on the past. In the same way, disagreements that happen have likely happened before, so you can have procedures ready to resolve them. (Shortform note: An even better approach might be to go beyond conflict resolution and [think about conflict prevention](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemyatt/2012/02/22/5-keys-to-dealing-with-workplace-conflict/?sh=29ed64c61e95). Identify potential areas of conflict and intervene before they arise.)

**Know when it’s time to stop debating and to move on.** Get the big things right, and don’t worry about perfecting the small things. However, if you disagree on whether it’s important to debate something, it probably should be debated. (Shortform note: [If you have a perfectionist on your team](https://hbr.org/2011/10/how-to-manage-a-perfectionist.html) who can’t let things go, help them become more self-aware and understand how obsessing over small details can stymie both team and personal progress.)

#### Make the Decision

After the discussion has ended, Dalio says it’s time to collect the votes from everyone, then weigh each person’s vote by how credible they are regarding this decision. Compare the democratic equally weighted result with the credibility-centered vote. If the two align, then the answer is easy—you have a final decision, and you can move on. If the two disagree, then you should generally go with the credibility-centered vote. (Bridgewater has automated this process using an in-house app.)

Dalio says the vote is just a strong suggestion—the right to debate is not the same as the right to make decisions, and the meeting still has one person who’s ultimately responsible for making the final call. In some cases, this final decision-maker can override a credibility-centered vote, but should only do so when they can define _specifically_ what they disagree with, explain their logic, and state that they understand the risks of being wrong.

If the decision you wanted isn’t what’s decided, you must support the decision. This signals that you believe in the validity of the system more than you care about getting your way. The success of the group is more important than your individual desire.

​​(Shortform note: While Dalio has a lengthy decision-making process, Malcolm Gladwell presents another way to go about it in [Blink](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink): [making decisions in an instant](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink) using snap judgments. Snap judgments operate quickly, using patterns from previous experiences. You can improve your snap judgments by considering only the most essential information and preparing for situations that potentially require quick decisions.)

> **Potential Pitfalls of Shared Decision-Making**
> 
> Getting more people to weigh in on decision-making can lead to greater insight, reveal blind spots, and lead to better decisions. However, such [collaborative work can have two significant downsides](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload):
> 
> - **Collaboration overload**—research suggests that people spend around 80% of their time in collaborative activities, whether in meetings or attending to tasks other than their own. This leaves little time for critical individual work.
>     
> - **Uneven work distribution**—research also shows that only three to 5% of employees contribute 20 to 35% of the value. (This may be the case for Bridgewater’s more credible employees.) These employees may become overloaded with requests from other people.
>     
> 
> To avoid these pitfalls of collaboration, companies should recognize when collaboration is necessary, redistribute work to help ease the load of overburdened or more credible employees, and incentivize effective collaboration.
