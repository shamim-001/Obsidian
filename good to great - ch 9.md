# Good to Great

## Chapter 9: Great to Lastingly Great

#### Top-Line Takeaways

- Contrary to Collins’s expectations, _Good to Great_ isn’t a sequel to his bestseller _Built to Last_—it’s a _prequel_.
    
- Enduringly great companies adhere to good-to-great concepts in their infancy. It’s only when they’ve achieved greatness that they begin to adopt the qualities Collins outlined in _Built to Last_.
    
- Why the fixation on greatness? Collins believes that a desire to be great—rather than simply good or successful—is a natural byproduct of doing something we love. If we’re content with being just decent or average at what we do, then we’re probably in the wrong line of work.
    

### Built to Last (by Going From Good to Great)

In his previous bestseller _Built to Last_, Collins and his coauthor identified 18 lastingly great companies and studied how they constructed a durably great company from scratch. Using a similar methodology to _Good to Great_, the authors compared the lastingly great companies with competitor companies.

The enduringly great companies from _Built to Last_, it turns out, adhered to many of the principles Collins discovered in _Good to Great_.

> **Great to Lastingly Great: Hewlett-Packard**
> 
> Bill Hewlett and David Packard were best friends in graduate school, and their company was simply an extension of their friendship—they wanted to work with each other as well as people that shared their values and passions.
> 
> They took the team-first principle to an extreme: The minutes of their first meeting, which took place in 1937, state that the company would compete in the field of electrical engineering by designing and manufacturing products. The minutes also show that discussion of _what they would actually manufacture_ was tabled until a later meeting.
> 
> After WWII, with revenues shrinking, Hewlett-Packard still retained talent, even if there wasn’t anything particular for those workers to do. The thinking was, **Fabulous people will do fabulous things, so why not have them do those things for us?**
> 
> Even after HP had become one of the most successful and admired companies in business history, Hewlett and Packard retained their (Level 5) humility. Packard, in fact, though a billionaire, lived in the small house he and his wife built in 1957 until he died. A eulogy pamphlet created by his family featured a picture of him on a tractor and the caption “David Packard, 1912–1996, Rancher, etc.”—no mention of his massive success as an industrial engineer and entrepreneur.

### Taking Good to Great to Lastingly Great

The four key ideas of _Built to Last_ are as follows:

- **Design Your Own Timeline**
    - Rather than look to the outside to see where you stand on your trajectory, set your own agenda and time benchmarks.
    - The idea is to build a company that can endure beyond individual product cycles or leaders.
- **Embrace the “And”**
    - When faced with an “either/or” choice, devise a solution that lets you have “both/and.”
    - You want your company to be able to pursue both terms in a dichotomy: freedom _and_ responsibility, consistency _and_ change, etc.
- **Develop a Core Ideology**
    - A “core ideology” is a combination of a core purpose (the deep justification for your organization’s existence other than turning a profit) and a set of core values (principles that guide your every decision).
- **Spur Progress, but Refer to the Core**
    - Adaptation and change is vital, and you should stimulate innovation and agility whenever and wherever you can _while also staying true to your core ideology_.

Collins found that all of the _Good to Great_ principles supported the four _Built to Last_ ideas.

#### More on the Core

One of the more surprising discoveries Collins and his coauthor made in _Built to Last_ was that, while a core ideology is essential, a specific _kind_ of core ideology isn’t.

That is to say, _**a core ideology can be anything you want, as long as you believe in it and refer back to it as you embark on the adaptations demanded by the facts of reality**_.

For example, Walt Disney represents both the adaptability needed to survive and thrive in a forever-changing marketplace _and_ the power of a core ideology. Although the company has diversified from animated features to television to theme parks and cruises, it has never strayed from its core ideology: Bringing joy to children through creativity, the refusal of cynicism, and obsessive attention to detail.

#### Hedgehog BHAGs

Another concept _Built to Last_ explores is the BHAG (pronounced _bee-hag_)—Big Hairy Audacious Goal. BHAGs are the **huge, seemingly impossible objectives that can inspire outsiders and stakeholders alike**.

But there are _good_ BHAGs and _bad_ BHAGs:

- A _good_ BHAG is one determined by the deep understanding derived from hedgehog thinking—the application of the three circles and the creation of a Hedgehog Concept.
    
    - Boeing, for example, began as a military contractor exclusively. When a level 5 CEO took over the company in 1952, he realized that the company’s knowledge of jet propulsion and manufacturing large airplanes could apply to the design and production of large-scale commercial aircraft.
        
    - The BHAG—to become the leading commercial aircraft maker in the world—was certainly bold, but it checks out when analyzed using the three circles: (1) The company’s technology and knowhow meant it _could_ be the best commercial aircraft manufacturer in the world; (2) commercial aircraft satisfied its economic variable (profit per aircraft model); and (3) the company’s managers were passionate about the move.
        
- A _bad_ BHAG is one determined by hubris, without the steady and disciplined development of a Hedgehog Concept.
    

### Must We All Strive for Greatness?

Before the transition point, both the good-to-great companies and their comparisons were either tracking or slightly bettering the general market return. But this didn’t feel enough.

Why try to build something great?

Collins has two answers:

#### #1: Greatness requires no more (and sometimes less) effort than goodness.

Although fewer companies reach greatness overall, the actual procedures necessary to achieve greatness—hiring the right people, developing a Hedgehog Concept, maintaining discipline—aren’t prohibitively painful.

Think about the “stop doing” list: **Many of the reforms necessary to achieve greatness actually involve _reducing energy output and waste_**.

#### #2: If you feel like what you do has purpose, the quest for greatness is a given.

The Level 5 executives Collins interviewed strived for greatness not for accolades or material rewards but rather for _the sake of_ _greatness itself_.

They believed deeply in their mission and the mission of their companies, and **because they felt like what they did had profound meaning, they wanted to do it as best they could.** It would never occur to them to settle for “just OK.”

If, at your job or in another area of your life, you find yourself content to float in the middle of the pack, it stands to reason that that part of your life doesn’t excite your imagination and passion. Remember hedgehog thinking: **Greatness requires great enthusiasm**. If you’re doing something you love, you can’t help but want to be great at it.

And once you start doing meaningful work, you will find yourself on the path to having a meaningful life and feeling like you made a contribution. Collins ends the book on a reflective note, saying that the greatest satisfaction is knowing that your short time alive meant something.
