# The Psychology of Money

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Part 2: Understand Why You Want Money

You’ve now learned why so many people fail to achieve financial success. In this section, Housel outlines some mindsets that he recommends you develop to foster a healthy attitude toward money. They involve understanding the true value of money so that you can know what expectations you should and shouldn't have for your wealth.

Housel argues that **the true value of money is that it buys you control over your time.** He also notes what _isn’t_ the true value of money: Money isn’t valuable because it buys you “more,” and it’s not valuable because it buys you respect.

### Lesson #5: Money Buys Us Control Over Our Time

In Chapters 7 and 10, Housel explains the true value of money: **Money buys you control over time**, which psychologists contend is the key driver of happiness.

Housel explains that when you have control over your time, you can choose what to do and when you want to do it. Housel argues that this ability—this flexibility—is essential for two main reasons. First, the more flexible you are, the more options you have—and the more economic opportunities you have access to. For example, you can afford to take time off to develop a new skill that sets you apart from your competition instead of getting stuck in a dead-end job. Second, the more flexible you are, the more of a safety net you have to endure the unexpected. For example, if you lose your job, you can take your time choosing your next job; you don’t have to take the first one you’re offered out of economic necessity.

(Shortform note: Financial flexibility isn’t just valuable for individuals—it’s valuable for companies, too. The Covid-19 pandemic prevented many companies from making money, either because they couldn’t provide their goods or because people could no longer afford their services. In such a situation, financial flexibility matters: One paper found that the stock [price of highly flexible firms fell by 26% less than the stock price of firms with low flexibility during the collapse period” of February 3 to March 23, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rfs/hhaa134/6046943).)

Housel argues that having a sense of control over your life is so essential that when we don’t have it, we rebel. Psychologists call this phenomenon “reactance:” People who feel like they don’t have control will refuse to do things they want to do just to regain that sense of control. For example, you might be thrilled about your job’s holiday party—but if they require you to go, you may feel differently.

> **The Scarcity Principle: Why You Want Control More When You Don’t Have It**
> 
> Our reaction to having no control over a situation may also be due to [the scarcity principle—the idea that we find things with limited availability more appealing](https://shortform.com/app/book/influence/chapter-7). In _[Influence](https://shortform.com/app/book/influence/)_, psychologist Robert Cialdini defines reactance as an adverse reaction we have to any restriction of our choices and explains that we don’t exhibit it if something is freely available because we don’t feel restricted. But scarcity limits our choices, especially if what we desire was previously abundant—so when something is scarce, we desire it even more than we did before. In other words, when control grows scarce, we want control even more than we did before and so we exhibit reactance.

Moreover, Housel suggests that Americans’ lack of control has caused a national satisfaction problem: American happiness levels aren’t as high as they should be because we lack control over our time. Housel explains that Americans’ median income has nearly doubled since 1955. If money made us happier, we should be twice as happy as we were 50 years ago. But we haven’t become significantly happier since 1955. Housel argues that this is because our relationship with time and work has changed. In the 1950s, most people performed some kind of physical labor. Their jobs ended when they left their workplace. But nowadays, many more people do knowledge work, so we think about our jobs long after we leave the workplace, making us feel like we’re always working and that we don’t have control over our time. Therefore, we’re not as happy as we used to be.

(Shortform note: In direct contrast to Housel, psychologist Steve Pinker suggests that [we might be less happy than we used to be because we have too much control over our lives](https://ideas.ted.com/the-world-is-an-amazing-place-so-why-arent-we-happier/). In 1955, there were strict expectations regarding people’s rules—for example, people had far fewer career options. He suggests that today, we have more freedom but we also have more uncertainty: When you have freedom to choose, you don’t always know what to choose. This uncertainty, Pinker suggests, causes anxiety and reduces our happiness.)

So how can you become happier? Housel admits that this is a difficult dilemma because it’s so individual: Different things make different people happy.

However, knowing what makes most people happy can help—and according to end-of-life interviews, people typically value not consumer purchases but the ability to develop quality relationships or to devote themselves to bettering the world. In other words, most people value the things they had the luxury to do because they controlled their time. Therefore, having more control over your time will likely make you happier, too.

(Shortform note: One way to increase your sense of control over your time—and thus your happiness—may be to [determine how much an hour is worth to you](https://jamesclear.com/value-of-time). Paying an accountant to file your taxes may initially seem wasteful. But if the time you save doing your taxes gains you more financial value—and allows you to do something you _want_ to do with that time—it may be worth the cost.)

### Lesson #6: Be Happy With Enough

You’ve now learned that money is valuable because it buys you time and flexibility—but how much money should you have? Housel never gives an exact number—but, he warns, wanting more than necessary can drive you to lose not just all your money, but also intangible, irreplaceable things like your freedom. That’s why he thinks that learning to **be happy with enough** is critical to financial success—a lesson he elaborates on in Chapter 3.

Housel explains that some people are never satisfied: No matter how much money they make, they still want more. This endless pursuit of more can often drive them to risk their existing wealth for wealth they don’t have and don’t even need—and to do so in both legal and illegal ways.

As a legal example, Housel cites the traders worth millions who invested their personal wealth into the hedge fund they managed, Long-Term Capital Management. Their desire for more caused them to take on such a high risk that they all lost their fortunes in one of the strongest markets in history. As an illegal example, Housel cites con artist Bernie Madoff. He didn’t need a Ponzi scheme to make him rich—his firm already made $25 to $50 million a year. But Madoff wasn’t satisfied, and his greed led him to mastermind the Ponzi scheme that ultimately cost him everything.

> **Not Just Greed: Why Do People Risk Their Wealth?**
> 
> Housel argues that people like the investors at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) and Madoff risk their wealth primarily due to greed, but other observers note that overconfidence and ego may also play a role.
> 
> Overconfidence may drive you to risk more than you should because it makes you think that you’re not _really_ risking that much. As one article notes, [the investors at LTCM were so overconfident in their investment strategies](https://www.forbes.com/global/2000/1211/0325120a.html?sh=197304e37a94) that they thought their single-day losses would never exceed $35 million; in actuality, the single-day loss that wiped them out was $553 million. Had they realized how much they were _really_ risking, it’s possible they would have thought twice about their actions.
> 
> Similarly, [Madoff may have committed his crimes not just because he was greedy, but because he wanted to protect his ego](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/21/madoff-corporate-fraud). As psychologists note, lots of greedy people never commit fraud. The ones who do often, like Madoff, are initially genuinely successful, which leads them to idealize themselves—so when they start to fail, they turn to fraud to protect their reputations.

But when you learn to **be happy with enough** money**—**whatever that amount is for you— you don’t take unnecessary risks with the money you’ve already accumulated. (Shortform note: In _[Mindfulness in Plain English](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindfulness-in-plain-english)_, meditation master Henepola Gunaratana suggests another method for combating greed and preventing yourself from taking unnecessary risks: [By meditating, you can find the emotional root of greed and destroy it](https://shortform.com/app/book/mindfulness-in-plain-english/chapters-2-3).)

#### How to Be Happy With Enough

So how can you learn to be happy with enough? Housel suggests a few ways:

**#1: Stop increasing your lifestyle standards.**

If you keep wanting an increasingly lavish lifestyle, you’ll never be satisfied. Not only will you then take dangerous risks to achieve satisfaction, you’ll grow envious of others who live whatever way you want at the time, which will diminish your enjoyment of life. Therefore, Housel states, it’s critical that, once you reach the lifestyle you want, you can be happy at _that_ lifestyle—not the one that’s slightly more prestigious.

(Shortform note: The phenomenon of your lifestyle becoming more expensive as your income grows is known as lifestyle inflation. Housel appears to disapprove of lifestyle inflation as a whole, but other financial experts point out that if your income increases, you should allow yourself to enjoy it. They recommend [spending on experiences rather than items](https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/23/slippery-slope-lifestyle-creep/?sh=1ae101457628): Experiences make you happier than things do, so you’ll feel more satisfied even if you spend the same money—which in turn may prevent you from feeling that your new lifestyle increase isn’t enough and wanting even more.)

**#2: Accept that somebody will always have more money than you.**

If you’re always comparing yourself to somebody richer, you’ll never be satisfied. Unless you’re the richest person in the world, someone always has more money than you do.

(Shortform note: This might be especially difficult if you’re always seeing how others live on social media. Combat social media envy by deleting your accounts or by [unfollowing the people who inspire the most envy](https://www.lifehack.org/600150/how-social-media-fuels-jealousy).)

**#3: Know your values.**

When you know your values, you realize that some things are more important than money. Therefore, you don’t risk losing those important things (like your time or freedom) in order to get less important things (like more money). In this way, knowing your values prevents you from taking dangerous risks with your finances.

(Shortform note: “Know your values,” is easy to say but hard to do. If you’re struggling to pinpoint yours, try strategies like [listing a few people you love and writing down why they’re important to you](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/changepower/201811/6-ways-discover-and-choose-your-core-values).)

### Lesson #7: Status Symbols Don’t Buy Respect

Another way to prevent yourself from spending more money than you need to is to understand the lesson Housel shares in Chapter 8: **status symbols don’t buy respect.**

Housel argues that people often covet status symbols because they want respect. When others admire your possessions, you assume that they’re admiring you. However, Housel contends, when people admire your status symbols, they barely notice you. Rather, they imagine how much other people would admire _them_ if they owned that symbol.

For example, if you buy a mansion and notice delivery drivers gawking at you when they pull up, you imagine that they think, “This house is so nice. The owner must be so sophisticated—I should treat her with respect.” But in actuality, they’re looking only at the house—not you—and thinking, “That house is so nice. If I lived here, people would think I’m so sophisticated and treat me with respect.”

So if you buy a status symbol, Housel recommends, remember that owning it won’t make people respect you as much as you expect. Instead, Housel urges, realize that you’ll gain the most respect from embodying good values like kindness.

(Shortform note: Some studies contradict Housel’s argument and suggest that status symbols _do_ buy respect—in other words, how wealthy you appear affects how well people treat you. In _[Pitch Anything](https://shortform.com/app/book/pitch-anything)_, sales coach Oren Klaff describes how the [higher-status you appear, the more likely people are to follow your lead](https://shortform.com/app/book/pitch-anything/chapter-3): When a well-dressed man jaywalked across a busy street into traffic, pedestrians often unthinkingly followed—but they didn’t follow a sloppily dressed person in the same situation. So while someone who sees you in fancy clothes may very well imagine themselves in those clothes, they also probably will treat you with the respect those clothes suggest you deserve.)
