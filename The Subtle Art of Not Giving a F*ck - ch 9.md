## Chapter 9: Value—Reflecting on Mortality

We prefer not to think or talk about death because we fear it. However, death is the yardstick we all use to measure our life and its meaning. Without death providing perspective, our lives and values wouldn’t mean anything.

Thus, Manson believes that accepting your mortality means **getting rid of superficial or selfish values** and **considering what impact your life has made on the world.**

- When we feel entitled, we put ourselves at the center and view everything and everyone from the perspective of how it affects us. This is our current social/cultural dynamic: We feel society should serve us, we try to impose our views on others, and we feel that we deserve things we haven’t earned.
- Instead, you should choose your values and make decisions with the reality of death in mind. For instance, being part of something greater than yourself, or caring about something beyond yourself. These kinds of selfless values are the ones that bring happiness.

(Shortform note: In _Meditations_, Marcus Aurelius points out that [even the most extraordinary people die](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/books-10-12). Most of us will be forgotten once we’re gone; even if you’re one of the few people who’s remembered for centuries, that fame won’t do you any good once you’re dead, so why concern yourself with it? Therefore, Aurelius argues, self-serving goals are meaningless. **The only important thing in life is what you can do for others.**)

Instead of feeling a need to be extraordinary because society celebrates only the extraordinary, Manson urges you to realize that _true fulfillment_ comes from questioning yourself and choosing your own values—choosing what to give a f*ck about.

In short, **confronting the reality of death teaches you to prioritize what’s important, and to stop chasing or worrying about trivial things.**

> Accepting that you’ll die someday can sharpen your focus, and make you realize what’s really important to you. However, the _fear_ of death may do the opposite; it may act as a distraction, and prevent you from fully committing to your new values.
> 
> There are many ideas about why we shouldn’t fear death, but perhaps the simplest is an [Epicurean](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Epicureanism) argument: “_Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo_” (I did not exist, I existed, I do not exist, I do not care). In other words, you won’t care after you’re dead, because there won’t be a _you_ to care about it. **There’s no reason to be afraid of something that you’ll never experience.**
> 
> Aside from no longer existing, the other thing people commonly fear about death is [leaving things unfinished.](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/why-youre-afraid-to-die-f286d325664b) For these people, the fear isn’t so much death itself as it is dying without a sense of fulfillment. Finding that fulfillment is what Manson’s lessons are all about. That’s why he says it’s so important to give the right f*cks and devote your energy to the right things—so that you’ll live a life that’s meaningful to you, and that you’ll be satisfied with when your time comes.

### Accepting the Reality of Death

To deal with the fear of death, people often come up with ways to leave a legacy: for example, putting their name on something, contributing to a cause, or doing something that will be remembered.

However, Manson says that focusing on a legacy may or may not be a positive thing. He references the work of psychologist and author Ernest Becker, who argued that we should instead **confront the inevitability of death, and focus on having better values in life.**

Becker was a professor of anthropology in the sixties when he got colon cancer. In order to cope with the fact that he was dying, he researched and wrote an influential book, _[The Denial of Death](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Denial-of-Death/Ernest-Becker/9780684832401)_, about coming to terms with death.

Becker said that because humans, unlike animals, have the ability to conceptualize past and future, and to imagine a future in which we no longer exist, we experience “death terror.” This anxiety about death underlies everything we do.

Becker argued that instead of focusing on immortality projects, you should question the identity you’ve created, and strive to accept the reality of death. **Instead of futilely pursuing immortality, you’ll then be free to choose more meaningful values in life.**

> In _Antifragile_, Nassim Nicholas Taleb offers a scientifically-grounded idea about why [death is not just inevitable, but necessary](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/antifragile/chapters-21-22).
> 
> The basis for Taleb’s concept of antifragility (becoming stronger through damage or injury) is that weak parts of a system are destroyed by stress, and the remaining parts overcompensate for that stress to protect itself in the future (like a weightlifter’s muscles, which break down from exercise and rebuild themselves stronger than before).
> 
> Taleb applies that concept to us, treating the human race as a “system.” He explains that individuals are fragile, and they must die so that the species as a whole can be antifragile. Following that logic, he makes much the same argument as Manson (and Aurelius, and many others throughout history): We shouldn’t try to live forever; rather, we should live good lives and then make room for others.

#### Life Is Short: Spend It Wisely

We commonly distract ourselves from the inevitability of our death is by giving too many f_cks about things and feeling entitled, as we’ve explored throughout this guide. However, Manson believes that** saving your f_cks for important things is part of accepting your mortality. **

When you accept that your time is finite (and, therefore, so is the number of f_cks you can give in life), you recognize the importance of spending those f_cks wisely. Your main concerns shouldn’t be living forever, or being remembered once you’re gone—immortality is impossible, and being remembered does you no good.

Instead, Manson concludes, focus on what’s really important: The impact you can make on the world through constructive values and focused efforts. In other words, **live a fulfilling life by giving the right f*cks, and you’ll have no reason to fear death.**

(Shortform note: Seneca the Younger was another prominent Stoic philosopher like Marcus Aurelius. Seneca wrote the famous essay _[De Brevitate Vitae](https://dailystoic.com/on-the-shortness-of-life-seneca/)_ (On the Shortness of Life), wherein he argued that our problem isn’t that life is too short, but rather that we waste too much of our limited time. He urges us to examine our lives and **decide if we’re really living our lives, or just passing the time until we die.**)
