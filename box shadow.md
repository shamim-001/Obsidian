#css #box-shadow 

Default value: offset
```css
box-shadow:
    0 0 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),
    inset 0 0 0 3px #EFEFEF,
    inset 0 0 10px black,
    0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
```

1. The first shadow:
   ```css
   0 0 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
   ```
   This shadow has the following properties:
   - `0` for the horizontal offset (no horizontal shadow).
   - `0` for the vertical offset (no vertical shadow).
   - `0` for the blur radius (no blurring effect).
   - `4px` for the spread radius (creates a shadow that is 4 pixels larger than the element).
   - `rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` for the color and transparency of the shadow. It is a semi-transparent black color defined using RGBA values.

2. The second shadow:
   ```css
   inset 0 0 0 3px #EFEFEF
   ```
   This shadow is an inset shadow, meaning it appears inside the element. It has the following properties:
   - `inset` keyword to indicate that it is an inset shadow.
   - `0` for the horizontal offset (no horizontal shadow).
   - `0` for the vertical offset (no vertical shadow).
   - `0` for the blur radius (no blurring effect).
   - `3px` for the spread radius (creates a shadow that is 3 pixels smaller than the element).
   - `#EFEFEF` for the color of the shadow. It is a light gray color defined using a hexadecimal value.

3. The third shadow:
   ```css
   inset 0 0 10px black
   ```
   This shadow is also an inset shadow and has the following properties:
   - `inset` keyword to indicate that it is an inset shadow.
   - `0` for the horizontal offset (no horizontal shadow).
   - `0` for the vertical offset (no vertical shadow).
   - `10px` for the blur radius (creates a shadow with a 10-pixel blur effect).
   - `black` for the color of the shadow. It is a solid black color defined using a named color.

4. The fourth shadow:
   ```css
   0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
   ```
   This shadow has the following properties:
   - `0` for the horizontal offset (no horizontal shadow).
   - `0` for the vertical offset (no vertical shadow).
   - `10px` for the blur radius (creates a shadow with a 10-pixel blur effect).
   - `rgba(0,0,0,0.2)` for the color and transparency of the shadow. It is a semi-transparent black color defined using RGBA values.

Overall, the `box-shadow` property in the provided CSS code creates multiple shadows for the element. The first shadow is a larger, semi-transparent black shadow that extends beyond the element. The second shadow is a smaller, light gray inset shadow, while the third shadow is a larger, black inset shadow with a blur effect. The fourth shadow is another black shadow with a blur effect. The combination of these shadows creates a layered and dimensional effect for the element.
