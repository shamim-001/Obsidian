## Chapter 5: Building for Future Profits

Thiel presents creative monopolies as the solution to destructive competition, but he also cautions that creating a technological monopoly does not in and of itself guarantee the success of your startup. **Thiel measures the worth of a startup by considering how much profit it has the potential to bring in ten or twenty years down the road**.

Thiel illustrates the importance of _long-term_ value by contrasting traditional print media companies with social media platforms. Successful print media companies bring in steady profits, but their stock is valued relatively low because they have little potential for future growth. By contrast, social media companies often fail to make a profit during their first decade of operation, yet their stock value may soar because their revenues are growing exponentially, promising significant growth and future profitability.

Thiel cautions that many companies fall into the trap of focusing on short-term profits instead of long-term revenue potential because short-term profits are easier to track. But fixating on metrics that reflect only short-term performance can steer you away from long-term profitability. To be profitable in the long run, your monopoly must possess certain characteristics, and you must manage your company wisely.

### Crucial Characteristics

Thiel discusses four characteristics of a startup that endow it with potential for long-term profitability.

#### 1) Proprietary Technology

To build a monopoly in the first place, Thiel says you have to create something unique—ideally you create new capabilities that no one else has. If you’re just improving on existing capabilities, you need to improve them by an order of magnitude to have any chance of building a monopoly.

Moreover, to stand the test of time, your company’s unique capabilities must be difficult for anyone else to reproduce—whether because they’re protected by patents, copyrights, trade secrets, or just because you’re technologically a step ahead of anyone else, such that they can’t compete on your level.

#### 2) Network Effects

Another key element of maintaining a monopoly is network effects. In essence “network effects” means that the value of your product is directly proportional to the number of people who use it. For example, in Thiel’s case, the more people and businesses started using PayPal, the more widely their service was accepted, and the more useful it became.

Network effects help to ensure the monopoly status of your product in the long-term, because once a lot of people are using your product, no one else can create a competing product with as much value, because they won’t start out with the same user base.

Thiel advises that to create network effects, your product must be valuable enough to its first users that they will want to share it around. As new users get their friends to start using it, your user base grows exponentially.

#### 3) Economies of Scale

Economies of scale occur when your product becomes more economical to produce the more you scale up your operations. For example, in the software industry, there is an initial cost to develop an app, but once it’s developed, the cost of selling additional copies is negligible. Thus, the more copies you sell, the lower you can set your price and still make a profit.

Thiel advises you to **plan out how you will scale up your business from the very beginning**. Monopolies benefit from economies of scale much like they benefit from network effects, so your business model needs to scale well to support your monopoly.

#### 4) Branding

Thiel asserts that your brand needs to be unassailable: If you want to hold on to monopoly status, everything about your product should be consistent with the claim that your product is in a class by itself, from the core technology to the user experience to the packaging.

### Managing Your Startup for Long-Term Success

Even if your startup has characteristics that set you up for success, you still have to plan your moves intelligently to realize its potential. Thiel gives four pieces of strategic advice for managing your startup.

#### 1) Choose Your Initial Market Carefully

Thiel advises you to **start out targeting a small market**, because your startup will be a small company, and you won’t have the resources to monopolize a large market yet. He warns against attempting to secure a small share of a large market, reiterating that if you’re a small player in a big market, competition will prevent you from making a profit. That said, he also cautions that your market needs to contain enough real customers to be profitable.

He illustrates this by recounting how PayPal targeted PalmPilot users as its first market, but found that they were too few and far between to represent a valuable market sector. Then they switched to targeting eBay sellers and found a small but lucrative market that they quickly dominated.

#### 2) Expand Into Adjacent Market Sectors

**Once you’ve dominated a small market sector, slowly expand into related markets that are a bit broader.**

Thiel illustrates this concept with the example of Amazon. After establishing themselves as the dominant online book dealer, they expanded into selling other types of media and eventually all kinds of consumer products.

#### 3) Don’t Pit Yourself Against the Establishment

As we’ve discussed, Thiel sees head-to-head competition as a death-knell to profitability. He warns that high-tech startups often fall into the trap of competing with established companies under the guise of “disrupting the industry.”

It’s true that sometimes new technologies disrupt the market, displacing established market leaders. But in Thiel’s experience, all too often, a startup will claim to be “disrupting the market” when in reality they are merely improving upon an existing technology and trying to take market share away from established players. Don’t fall into this trap.

Thiel conjectures that if your product is truly innovative, it will be unique enough to create a new market: There won’t be an existing market for you to disrupt or a direct competitor for you to displace. **Focus on creating something that’s new enough to have no competition, not on creating a product to disrupt existing markets.**

#### 4) Secure Your Position as the Final Authority

Your goal is to build a monopoly that will generate long-term profits by introducing a revolutionary product that no one else can match. Thiel observes that to do this, generally **you need to be the first to introduce your product**. In industries where network effects and economies of scale are significant, the first product to rise to prominence becomes almost impossible to compete with.

As Thiel explains, this is known as the “first-mover advantage,” and he advocates using it to good effect. However, he also cautions that moving first is merely a means to an end, not an end in itself.
