## Law #9: People Are Influenced by Their Generation

In the previous law, we looked at how people are influenced by the groups they belong to. Now, we’ll look at one of the groups that _everyone_ belongs to—their generation. Generations are huge groups consisting of everyone who was born within the same 22-year period. Sometimes, the people born on the fringes may identify more with an earlier or later generation than their own.

Even though everyone who lives at a particular time experiences the same conditions, **we all see the world through a generational perspective, which is a collective mindset we develop based on our age.** (For example, when we’re teenagers, we find that our parents’ way of seeing the world doesn’t match our experience.) Our values are shaped by the generation we live in and how our generation reacts to the previous one.

**Not everyone in a generation is the same, of course**—there are more aggressive people who become leaders, people who prefer to follow, and rebels who try not to fit into their own generation. (However, even though the rebels might outwardly try to be different from other members of their generation, their actions are usually motivated by the same spirit. For example, the young conservatives in the 1960s might have been preaching values that opposed the rest of the generations’, but they did so using the same idealism and passion as the rest of their generation.)

In this law, we’ll first study generational awareness. Then, we’ll use what we’ve learned to make people like us.

### Study the Law: Acquire Generational Awareness

**Generational awareness is a knowledge of how our time shapes us, and more generally, how generations shape everyone.** We can acquire this awareness by studying generational cycles and collective spirit.

#### Generational Cycles

Each generation has different art and thinking styles, and **these styles alternate and repeat throughout the generations.** Even what might appear to be surface-level (such as fashion) is in fact related to underlying psychological shifts. For example, when looser clothing became popular in the 1780s, this coincided with a desire for fewer societal constraints.

Generations follow a four-phase cycle:

1. **The first generation is revolutionary**—members change the existing conditions, usually creating some instability. The instability isn’t necessarily violent—it could also be a major shift in values. This generation usually includes strong leaders.
2. **The second generation seeks stability** because they came of age during revolution. Members band together for safety.
3. **Members of the third generation are individualistic** because they never experienced revolution and don’t feel the need to gather allies.
4. **The fourth generation feels that society is plodding and valueless. This attitude leads to some sort of crisis,** often because when we lack values, we turn to demagogues or scapegoats, or tribalize. This generation usually includes a group of people who want to go back in time.

**The cycle always includes the new generation pushing back against the values of the previous generation.** The author thinks this might be because we develop our generational perspective when we’re young and tend to think absolutes. Additionally, this pattern is probably somewhat responsible for our survival—if we continued by getting wilder and wilder, or more and more conservative, humanity would probably die out.

- For example, the silent generation lived through the Great Depression and World War II and craved stability. The baby boomers found this stability boring and were adventurous and idealistic.

Technology is speeding up the generational cycle. These days, there are more crises, and it can be hard to identify which ones are notable turning points in the cycles.

#### The Development of Collective Spirit

**Collective spirit is a mood and way of relating to people.** Each generation develops their own spirit and it morphs as the generation ages, but its core always remains the same.

- For example, the 1920s included wild parties, lots of sex, and a cynical attitude. As the people who lived through this time grew up, they may have stopped partying, but they maintained their cynicism and brazenness.

Here’s how this spirit develops during different life stages:

##### Childhood

When we’re young, we’re impressionable and **we’re highly influenced by our parents and teachers.** We adopt their values, perspectives, and spirit.

##### Adolescence

As we get older, we start to connect more with our peers. By the time we’re teenagers, we have much more in common with the people our age than our parents, and we’re actively rebelling against our parents and trying to carve out our own separate identity.

At this time, **we start to develop collective spirit and we create our own culture—what we think is funny or cool or valuable is different from what our parents would characterize as such.** The more we learn about the world, the more we realize our parents haven’t interpreted it very accurately, and we need a more relevant perspective.

**The clash between generations is also part of the collective spirit.** Usually, four generations are alive at the same time, and their relationship to each other (called the zeitgeist) shapes all of them.

- For example, in the 1960s, the older generation didn’t like the youth culture, and both generations were shaped by the conflict.

Sometimes, one generation’s collective spirit (usually the teenage one, because youth are more flexible and restless) is so strong it takes over the prevailing culture.

Interestingly, today, because technology has aided globalization, people might have more in common with someone halfway across the world who’s a member of the same generation than someone in a different generation in their region.

##### **Twenties and Thirties**

As we hit our twenties and thirties, we acquire the power to start changing the world as we move into the workforce. **We continue to develop our collective spirit as we conflict with the older generation, who judge us and see us as too young and immature to make changes.** (Being judged by an older generation dates back to at least Babylonian times—an inscription on a tablet from 1000 BC complains that the youth of that time were “lazy” and “rotten.”) We judge them back.

None of us can judge objectively because we’re influenced by our generational thinking. Additionally, most generations see their flaws as values.

- For example, generations that don’t want to own cars might chalk this up to wanting to save the environment, when in fact, it’s generational cautiousness.

##### Forties and Midlife

At this point in our lives, members of our generation have taken leadership roles and have even more power to change the world. **Our collective spirit develops as we judge the younger generation, just as the older generation judged us.** Typically, our attitude is that youth these days are a problem, though we might be secretly envious of their youth.

#### Identify Collective Spirit

Consciously understanding your generation’s collective spirit will help you determine values related to success, failure, status, and expression. Assess the spirit by studying:

- **Major events that happened as your generation came of age.** Typically, the events that happened when you and the members of your generation were between 10-18 would have had the most effect since you were both susceptible to influence and developing your own values during this time. If these events were crises, your generation will tend to dislike conflict and band together. If there were no major events, your generation will tend to be adventurous.
    - For example, the 1950s were quite stable and the generation that grew up during this time became restless.
- **Inventions and new technology that allow people to interact in new ways.**
    - (Shortform example: Smartphones became widespread as Millennials came of age and are a large part of social culture.)
- **How people socialized,** especially in their twenties.
- **Attitudes around work.** Some generations look for stable jobs right after graduating. Others go on adventures first or job-hop, exploring options.
- **Dominant parenting style.** Permissive parenting tends to give children a wild attitude.
- **Notable and admired people in a generation.** These people’s values often represent the generation’s values, even if the average person is too shy to outwardly express these values.
- **Trends.** It’s often easiest to identify collective spirit in the artistic creations of the times—such as movies or music—because trends and art represent values.
    - For example, liking jazz indicates free-spiritedness.
- **Shadow sides.** Generations, like people, have shadow sides. These are often most visible in the type of humor that’s popular (because people use humor for release), gender relationships, and extremes behavior (because acting extreme is often a way of masking desire).
    - For example, young people in the 1960s appeared to dislike material goods, but over the next 20 years, it became clear that this generation _was_ interested in material goods as they grew up to be yuppies.
- **Gender relationships.** Some generations value balancing the genders, while others pigeonhole people.
    - For example, in the 1920s and 1930s, celebrities had a dose of the opposite gender. Rudolph Valentino was feminine.
- **Understand the zeitgeist,** especially the relationship between the middle generations of people who are 22-44 and 45-66. Figure out which generation is most dominant and which currently has more influence. Also, determine where these two generations fit into the generational cycle.
- **Consider criticism from other generations.** Instead of getting defensive or criticizing back, carefully consider what other generations have to say about yours. Try to look at your memories and values objectively.

### Make People Like You: Connect With Generations

Once you understand your generation and your zeitgeist, you can use this knowledge to make yourself and your ideas popular. For example, if there’s something about the world or a different generation that you don’t like, it’s highly likely that a large proportion of your generation feels this too, so you’ll have support if you try to make a change.

Here are some ways to take advantage of your generational knowledge to make yourself likable:

**Strategy #1: Associate yourself with a historical figure in a similar zeitgeist.** Since the generational cycle repeats regularly, there will be historical movements and leaders that are similar to you and what you’re trying to do today. These figures have a mythic air that you can use to lend yourself some gravitas (but be a more relevant, progressive version).

- For example, John F. Kennedy called his programs “New Frontier” to create a link between what he was doing and the pioneer spirit of the past.

**Strategy #2: Use childhood callbacks** (if you still remember your childhood). Everyone in your generation had similar childhood experiences and childhood was an emotional time, so if you can recreate this spirit when presenting your ideas, they’ll resonate.

- (Shortform example: If you’re advertising a product to Millennials, consider using a song that was popular in the ‘90s in your ads.)

**Strategy #3: Invent a new way for people to interact with each other.** People always want to connect with each other and if you can create a venue or new way of using technology, or break down communication barriers, people will like your idea.

- For example, in the 1920s, speakeasies were a place to socialize during Prohibition for members of a certain generation.

**Strategy #4: Don’t criticize your generation.** If there’s a particular part of your generation’s spirit you don’t agree with, try to subvert or redirect it rather than attacking it head-on.

- For example, if you want to share ideas from other generations, you might include them in a book, but write the book in the style of the current times.

**Strategy #5: Adapt.** As you get older and as younger generations start to enter the workforce, take leadership positions, and make changes, you need to adapt your own spirit to maintain the breadth of your audience. You might adopt some of the younger generation’s values.

- For example, Alfred Hitchcock started his career in the 1920s in the silent film era. At this time, film valued visual language. Over the next 60 years, as films began to include sounds, color, and genre elements, Hitchcock kept using his visual language but also learned new techniques.

**Strategy #6: Don’t let the past influence you.** When you were a child, your parents and other adults of their generation instilled their values in you, so you may feel conflicted about making a change. Pull away from the past and go your own way. Others will follow.

**Strategy #7: See into the future.** Collective spirit and the generational cycle make people act in predictable ways. If you can see sense changes in attitudes and articulate them early, people will connect with you and want to follow you.

> **Extended Example: French Revolution**
> 
> When King Louis XV died, many French citizens hoped that his successor, his 20-year-old grandson Louis XVI, would revitalize the country. The lower classes were restless, wanted power, and thought that many elements of the monarchy had run their course. However, **Louis XVI was unaware of Law #9 and tried to stop the generational cycle, which ultimately led to his execution.**
> 
> **Though Louis XVI was young, he clung to the ways of past generations.** He was terrified to take power and took comfort in the outdated concept of divine rule, which stated that he was crowned because God had chosen him. **He continued to run the country as his grandfather had, even though the citizens were clamoring for change,** notably tax reform.
> 
> Unlike Louis XVI, **middle-class lawyer Georges-Jacques Danton _was_ aware of Law #9 and saw signs that the citizens were getting fed up with the king and upper classes. He predicted that there was going to be unrest** and gave speeches about the future of France. He became popular and so much of the public supported his ideas that the king was forced to call an Estates General assembly to discuss the tax reforms with the citizens, nobility, and clergy.
> 
> **Louis XVI held the assembly at Versailles, expecting that the palace’s grandeur, imagery, and symbolism would remind the commoners of their place and the monarchy’s power.** However, the commoners were unimpressed by the palace—to them, it was old and out of style. They were even less impressed by Louis XVI’s refusal to concede on the tax reforms. To Louis XVI’s shock, the citizens created a group called the National Assembly and called for a constitutional monarchy.
> 
> Louis XVI ordered the organization to disband. They disobeyed. No one had ever disobeyed a royal decree before and **Louis XVI couldn’t understand why the people weren’t behaving as the previous generation would have.** He tried to use force to get people to re-believe in traditional values.
> 
> The revolutionaries, including Danton, revolted. Louis XVI and his family were taken prisoner, the National Assembly voted to make France a republic, and **Danton was named minister of justice.** Louis XVI was executed.
