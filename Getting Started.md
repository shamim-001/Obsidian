# Getting Started with TypeScript

## Terms

- **Dynamically-typed Languages**: Languages in which the type of variables is determined at runtime and can not change later.
- **IntelliSense**: Most IDEs and code editors supporting TypeScript provide incredible IntelliSense and auto-completion, offering active hints as you code.
- **Refactoring**: Changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior.
- **Source maps**: Files that represent the mapping between TypeScript and JavaScript code, used for debugging.
- **Statically-typed Languages**: Languages in which the type of variables is set at compile-time and cannot change later.
- **Transpiling**: Using the TypeScript compiler to convert TypeScript code into regular JavaScript for execution by browsers.
- **Type safety**: By providing type information in our code, we can catch more bugs at compile time.

## Summary

- Programming languages divide into two categories: statically-typed and dynamically-typed.
- In statically-typed languages (e.g., C++, C#, Java), the type of variables is set at compile-time and cannot change later.
- In dynamically-typed languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby), the type of variables is determined at run-time and can change later.
- TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with static typing and additional features for writing more concise and robust code.
- Providing type information in TypeScript leads to better refactoring support in most IDEs and code editors.
- Browsers can't understand TypeScript code directly, so it needs to be compiled into regular JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler for execution.
- Configurations for the TypeScript compiler can be adjusted by enabling/disabling various settings in `tsconfig.json`.
