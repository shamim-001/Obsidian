## Part 3: What to Include in Your Financial Strategy

Now that you understand how to think about money, we’ll discuss the essential elements you must include in your financial strategy. Housel posits that there are three main elements: You must take advantage of compounding, you must save money, and you must include a plan for when things go wrong.

### Lesson #8: Take Advantage of Compounding

In Chapter 4, Housel explains that the longer you invest, the more money you make because returns _compound_—that is, they build on previous returns to make ever-increasing returns. Housel recommends that you take advantage of compounding by finding investments that return solid, consistent results over time. He argues that ultimately, this strategy will make you the most money.

He argues that because of the power of compounding, _how long_ you invest is the most important factor determining your investment success—even more than other factors that seem intuitively important, like your annual returns. Housel illustrates this point with the stories of James Simons and Warren Buffett. Hedge fund executive James Simons is arguably the world’s best investor: Since 1988, his annual returns have compounded at 66%—three times the rate of Buffett’s investments. However, Buffett is 75% wealthier than Simons. This is because Simons only started achieving his 66% rate when he was 50, while Buffett has been earning 22% a year since he was 10 years old. Buffett is wealthier not because he’s a better investor, but because he’s been investing for much longer.

(Shortform note: Buffett and Simons are also [good examples of the difference between what journalist David Epstein calls specialists, who master one professional field, and generalists, who have broad competence in many professional fields](https://shortform.com/app/book/range). Buffett has been investing his entire life; [Simons had a successful career as a mathematician and codebreaker before embarking on an investing career in his 40s](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030516/jim-simons-success-story-net-worth-education-top-quotes.asp). In _[Range](https://shortform.com/app/book/range),_ Epstein suggests that being a generalist is a more reliable path to success than being a specialist. But the stories of Buffett and Simons prove that you can achieve success both ways.)

Housel contends that **people often ignore the power of compounding because it’s so counterintuitive:** Even when you _know_ compounding works, it’s still hard to imagine that unimpressive returns lead to impressive numbers just because you waited. As such, we try to achieve impressive numbers through methods that intuitively seem better—like finding the investments with the highest annual returns—even though they don’t work as well as compounding does.

(Shortform note: _Why_ is compounding so counterintuitive? Psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains that [humans are notoriously bad at questioning what evidence might be missing](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/part-4-4). So even if we _logically_ know that how long you invest matters more than how much an investment returns in an individual year, we struggle to conceptualize and act on this information because we can’t _see_ the numbers in our bank account 50 years from now.)

> **_When_ You Invest Matters, Too**
> 
> Interestingly, an article Housel wrote in 2014 adds a nuance to the idea that how long you invest is the most important factor in your investment success: He describes how, [while how long you invest matters, the specific years in which you invest still significantly impact on how much money you gain over time](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/07/29/investing-luck.aspx). For example, someone who invested $500 in the S&P each month would have earned nearly $400,000 if they’d done so in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000, but only $60,000 if they’d done so in the 20 years between 1962 and 1982. This only applies if you invest little by little, _not_ if you invest a lump sum at once.
> 
> To avoid a similar fate, Housel recommends strategies similar to those we’ll learn about in Lesson 10: Diversify your investments to reduce the risk of all your assets having a bad year, and make sure that you have enough flexibility with your money to, for example, let it compound a few years longer if you retire in a bear market.

### Lesson #9: Prioritize Saving Money

In Chapter 10, Housel shares the second essential element of a successful financial strategy: **Prioritize saving money.**

Housel notes that many people don't save because they think saving is either unnecessary or impossible.

(Shortform note: A 2019 survey shed further light on why people don’t save: When asked why they didn’t save money, [Americans most frequently said they couldn’t afford to save due to their expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/the-no-1-reason-why-americans-struggle-to-save-money-isnt-debt.html)—and if you can’t afford your day-to-day life, you won’t save. To help prioritize saving money, [consider reducing your expenses first with strategies like eliminating unnecessary expenses from your life](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-automatic-millionaire/part-1).)

Housel argues that people who avoid saving are wrong for the following reasons:

First, **saving is essential to building wealth due to the nature of wealth**. As we've seen, wealth is the money you don't use—in other words, it's the money you save. Therefore, it's impossible to build wealth unless you save money.

Second, **saving is the most reliable way to build wealth because it's totally in your control**. Both of the other methods of building wealth—increasing your income and profiting off your investments—are full of uncertainty: For example, an investment strategy that works today might not work tomorrow depending on how the market goes. Saving money doesn't involve such risks: You always control how much you save, and saving will be just as effective tomorrow as it is today.

(Shortform note: Not all thought leaders distinguish between saving and investing the way that Housel does. For example, in _[The Success Principles](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles)_, Jack Canfield states that [you should maximize your savings by investing them](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-success-principles/principle-58) so that they can accumulate the maximum compound interest; he never suggests leaving some money in the bank. But by Housel’s definition, your investments don’t necessarily count as savings: If you’re not using them, they might be part of your wealth—but you can’t rely on them because you could lose them at any moment.)

Finally, **saving is a comparatively easy way to build wealth**. If Kei and Nick have the same net worth but Nick requires half as much as Kei to be happy, Nick can save twice as much as Kei and thus build his wealth twice as fast. This is a far easier task than Nick trying to increase his income or investment returns. (Shortform note: Saving can be so easy you only have to think about it once: Behavioral scientists recommend [setting up a system that automatically saves a portion of your income every time you receive any](https://www.ted.com/talks/wendy_de_la_rosa_a_simple_2_step_plan_for_saving_more_money/#t-161030).)

#### How to Save Money

So how, exactly, can you ensure you save money? Housel recommends that you **stop caring about others' opinions.**

Housel suggests that we overspend because we care too much about others’ opinions of us. He posits that there are three different levels of spending: The lowest level covers your necessities, the middle buys you comfort, and the highest allows you to purchase luxurious basics. But once you have enough income to cover the third level, Housel argues, you’re not spending for yourself. Instead, you’re spending for your ego—to prove to others how much money you have.

> **How Do You Know When You’re Spending Too Much?**
> 
> Housel argues that you should only spend enough to purchase luxurious basics, which are “comfortable, entertaining and enlightening”—but since this is subjective, it’s hard to know when you’re spending too much: you might think an apartment that’s 25 square feet is comfortable for one person, but someone else may disagree. On the one hand, it makes sense that Housel doesn’t define his levels of spending: As we learned in Lesson #1, what’s basic to you isn’t necessarily basic to someone else. On the other hand, his lack of definition makes it difficult to determine when you’ve gone too far: How can you know when you’re spending for your ego? The answer may be to determine what counts as enough, as we saw in Lesson #6. But since Housel states in the introduction that each chapter is meant to stand on its own, this isn’t clear.

By learning to be humble and ignore others’ opinions, you’ll naturally want less. When you want less, you’ll spend less, and you’ll save more.

(Shortform note: How can you learn to ignore others’ opinions? In _[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living)_, Dale Carnegie [recommends several strategies to help you handle criticism from others](https://shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/part-6), like becoming your own worst critic.)

### Lesson #10: Plan for Things to Go Wrong

In Chapter 13, Housel shares the final essential element of any financial strategy: **Plan for things to go wrong.**

Housel warns that people are often too optimistic with their finances, which leads them to put too much of their wealth at risk at any one time on a strategy that can be taken down by any one factor of bad luck.

(Shortform note: Why do people act too optimistically with their finances? In the blog post that he based this book on, Housel suggests that it’s partly because [people are uncomfortable with being wrong—so they grow convinced that their idea of the future is right](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/). He makes a similar argument in Lesson #18.)

As Housel notes, bad luck is an inevitable part of life. But unknown risks are, by definition, unknown, so we can’t predict them. Therefore, he advises that you plan for things to go wrong by following this advice:

**Never put your entire fortune at risk**, and instead risk only a small portion at a time. Keep enough invested in safe investments so that you can cover any losses incurred by your riskier investments**.**

> **Keeping Your Fortune Safe: The Extreme Version**
> 
> In _[Antifragile](https://shortform.com/app/book/antifragile)_, Taleb argues that you must embrace antifragility—things that get stronger instead of weaker under stress—to thrive in our modern world. He warns against putting your entire fortune at risk, but he emphasizes the extreme options over the average ones. He recommends investing with the barbell model: [Keep one end extremely safe (like by having 90% of your savings in the bank), and one end high-risk and high-reward (like by investing in extremely volatile stocks that might pay off massively)](https://shortform.com/app/book/antifragile/chapters-8-11). This way, you could earn a lot of money but you can only ever 10% of your money. But unlike Housel, Taleb urges you to avoid the middle-of-the-road strategies: It’s by protecting yourself from disaster and then chasing the greatest gains with your leftover money that you ensure that chance will, on average, work in your favor.

**Don’t create strategies that hinge on one single factor** because if that factor goes wrong, the entire strategy fails. Instead, have backup systems in place that protect you when a particular factor fails. For example, don’t rely on a single source of income to meet all your spending needs. Keep a backup savings account so that you can protect yourself even if you lose all your income.

(Shortform note: A single factor that many of us base our financial lives on is our ability to keep working. However, you could suffer a medical condition that prevents you from working—and while health insurance will pay your medical bills, you’re still responsible for your everyday expenses. That’s [why financial experts recommend not just having savings and health insurance but also disability insurance](https://www.debt.com/news/3-affordable-financial-safeguards-to-protect-your-health-and-income/).)

**When planning for retirement, save one-third more than you think you need to**. This way, you’ll have enough saved even if your future returns are one-third less than you expect.

(Shortform note: Another reason you might want to save more than you think you need for retirement is that, in emergency situations, you can use your retirement savings. In _[I Will Teach You to Be Rich](https://shortform.com/app/book/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/)_, financial expert Ramit Sethi suggests that if you end up with unexpected expenses and your only option is to use your credit card, you should [consider withdrawing money from your retirement account](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/chapter-8) instead. While this will incur losses on your retirement earnings, you’ll still save more than if you increase your existing credit card balance—and the exorbitant interest rates that come with it.)

#### How Planning for Setbacks Protects You

Housel explains that planning for inevitable setbacks protects you in several ways.

**It reduces the need for your predictions to be accurate**. If you aren’t correct in how the stock market is going to go, for example, you won’t lose everything if you've only risked some of your wealth on it. Your predictions don’t matter as much. (Shortform note: In this way, planning for setbacks reflects your humility: If you’re convinced you can’t fail, you won’t bother to plan for failure. So, increasing your humility may also increase the likelihood that you’ll plan for error. To increase your humility, consider strategies [like imagining times when you were humble](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-matters-most/202006/how-use-humility-right-now) prior to creating your financial plan.)

**It allows you to endure losses long enough to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities when they arise.** When you can weather occasional losses, you’ll still be in the game to reap the occasional windfall. Windfalls are infrequent but they can be the source of significant earnings if you’re able to grab them. This applies not only to the stock market but also to other types of investments. For example, if you’re running a company, you need to ensure it can get through times of no revenue so that you can be positioned to increase your business when the opportunity arises. Another example is in the housing market: If a downturn wipes your savings out, you won’t be able to take advantage of low housing prices, which could possibly lead to high future returns.

(Shortform note: Housel’s warning about being unable to take advantage of the housing market implies that he considers buying a house to be an investment. Some financial experts warn against this idea, stating that [you should consider housing a consumption good, not an investment](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2010/09/02/dont-think-of-it-as-an-investment). This is because houses have value based on the economic opportunities of _where they are_—so if you live in a house and your local economic opportunities suddenly decline, you now have both fewer economic opportunities _and_ a house that’s declined in value and may be a liability instead of an asset.)

**It** **reduces the danger that you’ll make poor choices because of emotions.** If you know most of your fortune is protected, you won’t overreact to bad results that affect some of your fortune. (Shortform note: Planning for setbacks may also protect your finances from the broader impact your emotions can have on your finances. For example, one study found that [if you make financial decisions while sad, you’re more likely to prioritize short-term over long-term gains](https://www.pnbmetlife.com/articles/wealth/how-emotions-can-influence-your-financial-decisions.html). But if you have, for example, a bigger savings account, you’ll be better able to handle the potential financial consequences of being sad for a long time.)
