## 1-Page Summary

Life can sometimes feel like an endless string of problems and setbacks. But what if it didn’t have to be this way? What if, instead of exhausting you and dampening your spirits, every challenge you faced made you tougher and more energized? In _The Obstacle Is the Way,_ Ryan Holiday argues that you have the power to create this kind of life for yourself by changing the way you view your problems.

Holiday explains that choosing to view obstacles in an empowering way is a major tenet of an ancient philosophy called Stoicism, founded in Greece in the third century B.C. According to Holiday, people throughout history have chosen to follow the Stoic tradition and utilized the same empowering strategy to solve their problems: **They find the hidden opportunity in any misfortune and use it as a tool to accomplish their chosen goal.** This philosophy has enabled people from every walk of life to overcome enormous obstacles and transform themselves into stronger, nobler people in the process.

This guide will teach you the tenets of Stoic problem-solving and how to apply them to the problems in your life. We’ll begin by explaining the basics of how Stoics view the world and the purpose of life—ideas that Holiday calls “The Discipline of Perception.” Then, we’ll explore specific strategies rooted in Stoicism that you can use to solve your problems: First, strategies to master your emotional state that Holiday refers to as “The Discipline of Will,” and second, strategies to efficiently accomplish your goals in the real world that Holiday refers to as “The Discipline of Action.”

> **Is This Really Stoicism?**
> 
> [It’s a point of contention](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/27/sorry-silicon-valley-heres-why-you-cant-actually-be-a-stoic-nowadays/?sh=162d11a2764c) whether or not _The Obstacle Is the Way_ and other pop-Stoic texts truly fit into the Stoic canon. _The Obstacle Is the Way_ [doesn’t claim to be a replacement for the original Stoic texts](https://dailystoic.com/obstacle-is-the-way-summary/) or even to comprehensively summarize them—Holiday prefers to label it as a book “inspired by” Stoicism rather than one that’s “about” Stoicism. This qualifying statement begs the question: **How faithful are the ideas in this book to the original Stoic teachings?**
> 
> There’s no single founding document of Stoicism outlining exactly what the philosophy represents, but many [ideas common across Stoic writings](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/) are present in _The Obstacle Is the Way_. Holiday agrees with the Stoics that through self-discipline, a “sage” can transform their life by becoming undisturbed by external events and learning to control irrational passions.
> 
> Holiday’s faithfulness to Stoic writing doesn’t stop there. The three disciplines that form the backbone of Holiday’s book—perception, action, and will—originated in the Roman Stoic text _[Discourses](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304102/discourses-and-selected-writings-by-epictetus/)_ by Epictetus. These specific English names were coined by Gregory Hays in the introduction to his translation of _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/1-page-summary)_ by the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius.
> 
> However, _The Obstacle Is the Way_ doesn’t perfectly represent the Stoic way of life. Holiday focuses his book on the ways you can use Stoicism to _get what you want out of life_ by amending your approach to problems. [Some argue this attitude undercuts the power of “true” Stoicism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/27/sorry-silicon-valley-heres-why-you-cant-actually-be-a-stoic-nowadays/?sh=162d11a2764c), which denies the need for material gain and puts greater emphasis on virtuous living. Holiday would likely make the case that while his book doesn’t paint a complete picture of the Stoic worldview, it doesn’t necessarily contradict it, either. As Holiday himself put it, [“Stoicism is a philosophy designed for the masses, and if it has to be simplified a bit to reach the masses, so be it.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/fashion/ryan-holiday-stoicism-american-apparel.html)

### Philosophy: Adopt an Empowering Worldview

We’ve distilled the Stoic problem-solving worldview into two basic truths. These truths are Holiday’s foundational beliefs about the world that lead him to conclude that you can (and should) transform any problem into an opportunity that benefits you.

#### Truth #1: No Event Is Necessarily Good or Bad

In our everyday lives, we assign meaning to everything that happens to us, judging events to be either good or bad. Holiday explains that in contrast, Stoics view events neutrally—that is, they observe only the facts of any given situation, without judgment.

In Holiday’s eyes, the positive or negative judgments we make about the events in our lives are nothing more than illusions—they’re often detached from reality. Additionally, Holiday argues that **these subjective judgments themselves are what cause much of our suffering**. Instead of seeing things as they are, we perceive problems that aren’t really there.

For example, imagine you hear a rumor that the company you work for is operating at a loss and several employees need to be fired. You fear you’re going to lose your job and begin to panic. Holiday would argue that **the risk of getting fired isn’t the problem—your warped, negative view of the situation, causing fear and panic, is the problem.** These feelings don’t necessarily reflect reality—even if you are fired, there’s a chance you might immediately find a better job, and getting fired will have been one of the best things to ever happen to you.

> **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Is About Cultivating Objectivity**
> 
> Holiday’s claim that subjective perceptions cause most of our suffering has significant support from the field of psychology. In the popular branch of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy, or “CBT,” a patient and therapist work together to identify the patient’s harmful and inaccurate perceptions of reality; replace them with healthier, more realistic beliefs; and build habits of responding to negative emotions in constructive ways.
> 
> In _[Feeling Great](https://catalog.pesi.com/item/feeling-great-68964)_, psychiatrist David Burns explains that people who suffer from anxiety and depression experience the types of distorted, irrational negative thoughts that Holiday mentions. For example, they overgeneralize, telling themselves that because they did one thing wrong, they are “bad people” doomed to make things worse for the rest of their lives. Or, they “discount the positive,” devaluing their successes and claiming that they don’t really count. Burns agrees with Holiday that seeing things objectively is a trainable skill, and for this reason, [he offers readers many exercises to help them perceive events without judgment.](https://feelinggood.com/2018/06/18/093-fifty-ways-in-fifty-minutes-part-1/)

#### Truth #2: You Can Choose to See Every Problem as an Opportunity

As Holiday explains, the cornerstone of the Stoics’ problem-solving philosophy is that **you can find a silver lining in any circumstance in your life**, no matter how dire it seems. Even if the only benefit you can find in an obstacle is an opportunity to practice acting virtuously, for instance, by restraining your anger or forgiving a misdeed, you’ve gained something of value.

Once you identify the upsides of a situation, Holiday claims that you can choose to be grateful that it happened. In short, **no event is inherently good or bad—your perspective determines whether it’s good or bad.** By choosing to claim the gift available in any problem, you remove its ability to hurt you.

For example, if you’re heartbroken by the death of a grandparent, you can use the tragedy as a reminder to treasure the time you still have with your parents. Shared grief may bring you closer to your emotionally distant siblings. You could even use this event as a reminder of your own death and start living life to the fullest.

Additionally, Holiday argues that seeing your problems as opportunities helps you overcome them, as you’ll be more likely to persevere through setbacks and discover hidden solutions. In other words, **your perception of a situation determines how you will respond to it**. In this way, what you tell yourself about an obstacle significantly influences how easy or difficult it is to overcome.

> **The Right Perspective Makes People “Lucky”**
> 
> Holiday argues that you can bring a positive attitude to any situation, but how exactly does it help you overcome your problems? Over several years, psychologist Richard Wiseman [conducted a study to determine what separates lucky people from unlucky people](http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/The_Luck_Factor.pdf). After examining and experimenting with hundreds of people who described themselves as either “exceptionally” lucky or unlucky, he found that the difference was entirely behavioral and had much to do with the subjects’ perspective on life events.
> 
> Wiseman asked subjects to imagine that they were at a bank during a robbery and wound up getting shot in the arm. Unlucky people labeled this as an unlucky situation, mourning that they happened to be in the bank when this crime occurred, while lucky people classified this as a lucky situation, noting that they could have easily been shot in the head and feeling grateful that they survived. **By comparing situations to worse alternatives, they were able to recontextualize any situation into something positive,** proving Holiday’s assertion that it’s possible to appreciate the upsides of any situation.
> 
> The lucky subjects who approached life with this positive attitude thrived because they took more risks, sought out more unfamiliar situations, and were more receptive to positive opportunities than their unlucky counterparts. These characteristics made them more likely to stumble into romantic success and promotions at work. As Holiday would predict, their optimistic perceptions determined how they responded to life events, making their lives demonstrably “luckier.”

### The Internal Fight: Master Your Emotions

So far, we’ve outlined two truths from Stoicism that Holiday asserts will help you fulfill your wildest ambitions. For the rest of this guide, we’ll be discussing specific strategies to help you live according to these truths: ways to reorient your thinking and overcome any problem. First, let’s look at Holiday’s internal, emotional strategies for success.

Holiday emphasizes the importance of **emotional regulation—intentionally deciding which emotions you will allow to influence your behavior**. It’s a simple fact of life: You will frequently feel emotions (such as fear and anger) that work against you and push you away from your goals. If you don’t exert control over these unhelpful emotions, you won’t be able to take advantage of the opportunities within your obstacles.

(Shortform note: Holiday’s stance on emotion regulation is less extreme than the original Stoic teachings. Holiday sees negative feelings as more or less an inevitable part of life, defining emotional discipline as the ability to act despite your unhelpful emotions. On the other hand, traditional Stoics [believed that by exerting your rationality, you can learn to completely cleanse yourself of harmful emotions](https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/).)

#### Strategy #1: Use Logic to Defuse Your Unhelpful Emotions

Holiday claims that by slowing down and analyzing your situation logically, you can soothe unhelpful, impulsive emotions like panic or anger. Whenever you feel yourself being tugged around by your emotions, **stop and interview yourself to discover why you feel the way you do**. Ask yourself questions, then answer them logically. You can overcome negative emotions by clarifying what irrational beliefs are making you feel this way and replacing them with a logical counterargument.

(Shortform note: In _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/)_, Daniel Goleman offers a caveat to this advice, [noting that thinking over an emotion for too long may extend and intensify your negative feelings](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2). Mental exercises such as Holiday’s self-interview may make you sadder by forcing you to dwell on whatever is making you sad. Instead, Goleman recommends intentionally planning pleasant distractions such as comforting TV or exercise to combat sadness.)

#### Strategy #2: Redirect Your Emotions Into Helpful Contexts

When you’re unable to fully rid yourself of negative emotions, **Holiday recommends you transform them into a form that serves you**. In particular, when unfair circumstances or pointless constraints frustrate you, Holiday suggests you use that anger as fuel instead of allowing it to make you reckless. Use your calm, rational mind to decide where to commit your energy, then allow yourself to act wildly and impulsively within that context.

(Shortform note: The process Holiday describes here—using your unhelpful emotions to motivate constructive action—[is known in psychology as sublimation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sublimation). Sigmund Freud introduced this concept into the public vocabulary. Although [the majority of Freud’s hypotheses have been discredited](https://www.livescience.com/why-freud-was-wrong.html), the concepts of sublimation and similar psychological defense mechanisms have endured.)

#### Strategy #3: Prepare for Long-Term Hardship

Holiday argues that to achieve your goals, you need resilience woven into your DNA as a permanent feature of your character. He asserts that **it’s possible to build this kind of emotional strength with practice over time.** Decide where you need to go and resolve that you will do anything it takes to get there, no matter what obstacles get in your way—then do it again. To a certain degree, it’s worth your while to intentionally seek out adversity to train yourself for the greater troubles that lie ahead.

(Shortform note: Holiday’s advice on how to cultivate perseverance can be boiled down to “Toughen up and do it.” On the other hand, in _[Grit](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit)_, Angela Duckworth [advocates for a gentler path to resilience](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit/part-2-1), one that doesn’t require as much sheer willpower. Duckworth asserts that you can develop grit in stages, initially pursuing something _fun_ that interests and gratifies you, then practicing to achieve superiority, and finally merging your skill with an altruistic purpose. In other words, **resilience develops naturally as you pursue satisfying goals**.)

#### Strategy #4: Take Things Step-by-Step

Holiday argues that the best way to tackle any fearsome problem or obstacle is to break it down and just focus on finishing one step at a time. Do the first step well, then move on to the next step and the next. Don’t think about the end goal, just what you have to do now. **When you have a plan to follow, problems feel less daunting**—each step is a psychologically manageable task that you can work up the courage to complete.

(Shortform note: In _[Eat That Frog!](https://shortform.com/app/book/eat-that-frog)_, Brian Tracy [notes that when a task reaches a certain size, it becomes impossible to plan out the entire process ahead of time](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/eat-that-frog/chapters-9-10) in the way Holiday describes. When your plan involves unknown variables or complex moving parts, the only thing you can do is take the first step and have faith that the next step will reveal itself to you. If you can become comfortable with this uncertainty, taking the task one step at a time will still help you feel less intimidated.)

#### Strategy #5: Motivate Yourself by Helping Others

Holiday asserts that **by turning your attention outward and helping others, you can tap into an unlimited source of motivation and strength** that will help you overcome obstacles. Negative emotions like anxiety and self-pity fade away when you discover a way to move forward and do good. Whenever you feel stuck, find a way to help someone other than yourself.

(Shortform note: While Holiday frames the feeling of contribution to others as a source of motivation to achieve your virtuous goals, in _[The Courage to Be Disliked](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-courage-to-be-disliked/1-page-summary)_, Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga [make the more extreme argument that these feelings of contribution are the essence of all happiness](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Courage-to-Be-Disliked/Ichiro-Kishimi/9781501197277#:~:text=The%20Courage%20to%20be%20Disliked%20is%20a%20book%20that%20instructs,accept%20others%20as%20they%20are.). Kishimi and Koga assert that happiness is based on self-worth—whether or not you think you’re a “good person”—and contribution to others is the source of all self-worth.)

#### Strategy #6: Accept Things for What They Are

Holiday’s final strategy to master your emotions is to accept things for what they are. Some aspects of life are impossible to change—for instance, the actions of others, or a tragedy that has already happened. **Holding an emotional grudge against a reality you can’t change will only make it more difficult to achieve your goals.** Instead, peaceably accept things for what they are.

(Shortform note: In _[The Happiness Trap](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-trap)_, Russ Harris explains how readers can use something called “Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,” or “ACT,” to find happiness in their lives. Harris uses the same rationale as Holiday to support his advice: We should focus on what we can control and peaceably accept whatever is out of our control. Harris, however, [gets more specific than Holiday, applying this logic to negative thoughts.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-trap/principle-2) If a negative thought pushes you toward something you can change, it’s helpful, so act on it. If it pushes you toward something you can’t change, accept it and ignore it.)

### The External Fight: Do What It Takes to Succeed

We’ll conclude with a set of Holiday’s strategies to overcome obstacles in the _external world_, difficult yet rewarding paths to success that require you to transform obstacles into gifts at every turn.

#### Strategy #1: Act, Don’t Think

The core of Holiday’s overall strategy for success is to **start immediately and rush toward your goal as quickly and aggressively as possible**. Consistently putting in effort is how you build the momentum necessary to reach your goals, and momentum is more important than anything else. If you ever stop aggressively moving forward with as much effort as you can muster, instead of overthinking your every step, you risk becoming soft and complacent.

(Shortform note: Holiday warns of the dangers of overthinking, but in _[The One Thing](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing)_, Gary Keller [argues that if you act without first considering how to optimize your effort, underthinking can be just as harmful.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing/chapter-1) Keller makes the case that even if you’re aggressively taking action toward your goal, you’re wasting your time if you’re not focusing on your “One Thing”—the task that will get you to your most ambitious goal faster than anything else. To find your One Thing, Keller suggests asking yourself [“What one thing can I focus on that will have the greatest impact on my overall goal?”](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing/part-2-chapters-10-12))

#### Strategy #2: Learn Something From Every Failure

Holiday acknowledges that if you follow his advice to act aggressively and persistently, you’ll inevitably fail often. However, he sees this as an unequivocally good thing. **Trial and error is the most effective way to learn anything**. Every failure teaches you how not to do something and forces you to come up with ideas you wouldn’t have normally thought of.

(Shortform note: In _[Thinking in Bets](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-bets)_, professional poker player Annie Duke argues that [the best way to learn from your mistakes is to view every decision you make as a bet](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/thinking-in-bets/chapter-1)—a gamble based on the idea that something _might_ be true. This way, you recognize that every belief you have has a chance of being incorrect, and every suboptimal decision you make comes at a cost.)

#### Strategy #3: Set Unreasonable Goals

Holiday asserts that people who habitually fear failure—that is to say, almost everyone—generally assume that they can accomplish far less than they actually can. To avoid this mistake, he advises you to **confidently set unreasonably ambitious goals and attempt to do the impossible**. He advises you to seek out high-pressure situations like this because they’re most likely to inspire your best work. By focusing on the energizing effect of a big risk, you can transform it from something terrifying into something exciting.

(Shortform note: In _[The 10X Rule](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule)_, Grant Cardone [argues that most people fail because they don’t set difficult enough goals](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-10x-rule/chapter-9). How can this be? Most people set average, realistic goals and underestimate the effort it takes to achieve them. When it becomes obvious how much work these goals actually require, they aren’t excited enough to push through the unexpected struggle, so they quit. On the other hand, accomplishing something that seems impossible is a dream that will make you _want_ to put in ten times the effort you normally would.)

#### Strategy #4: Predict What Will Go Wrong

Holiday argues that it’s important to remember that eventually, things will go wrong. People will let you down and random disasters will strike—this is the only constant in our unpredictable world. Your only defense is to anticipate what could go wrong and prevent or prepare for it. Holiday recommends making this a core step of your routine: **Before taking any action, try to think up contingency plans for everything you can imagine going wrong.**

(Shortform note: In _The Dichotomy of Leadership_, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin argue that while planning for what could go wrong (as Holiday suggests) helps avert painful disasters, _[overplanning—attempting to prepare a detailed response for every possible setback—can be just as harmful](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250195777/thedichotomyofleadership)_. Trying to predict everything that could go wrong will severely slow you down, and may even halt your progress entirely. At a certain point, this wasted time becomes more costly than it’s worth.)

#### Strategy #5: Do Something Unexpected

**In many cases, the most successful strategy is that which is _least expected_**. Holiday explains that the conventional strategy—the one other people in your situation use the most often—frequently has the lowest chance of success, as it’s the strategy your enemies and obstacles are the most prepared for. Using an obscure strategy to reach your goal often allows you to succeed with far less effort.

For example, if you’re trying to get your novel published, instead of sending query letters to agents or publishers and burying your pitch among thousands of others, find an unconventional way to make connections in the industry—for instance, locate a nearby writers’ conference to network at and volunteer to help run it.

(Shortform note: In _[The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power)_, Robert Greene [claims that even if your unexpected strategy isn’t successful in itself, acting unpredictably is still valuable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-48-laws-of-power/law-17). When no one understands why you’re doing something, you create an air of intrigue, attracting attention from onlookers. You may even earn their respect as people ascribe sophisticated motives to your actions that you never had.)
