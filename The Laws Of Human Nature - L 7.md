## Law #7: People Have Both Masculine and Feminine Traits

In the previous two laws, we looked at emotions (envy and aggression) that everyone hides. In this law, we’ll look at _traits_ that almost everyone represses.

**Everyone has both masculine and feminine traits, regardless of their gender.** These traits come from two sources: genetics, and the influence of our parents, particularly the one of the opposite sex who is the first person we meet who’s significantly different from us.

- For example, young boys tend to be emotional, empathetic, and sensitive, which they learn from their mothers. Young girls are strong-willed and adventurous, which they learn from their fathers. Children are also affected by their parents’ Shadow sides.

As we grow out of infancy, **we start seeking independence from our parents, and the easiest way to do this is to start fitting ourselves into the existing identity of gender roles.**

- For example, boys tend to develop aggression and independence as a way of differentiating themselves from their nurturing and loving mothers.

Gender roles create psychological distance between the sexes, and sometimes **this difference is so vast it makes people of different genders seem incomprehensible to each other.** This lack of understanding can lead to hostility between the sexes, especially in men, perhaps because their mothers make them feel dependent and other women remind them of this dependency. As genders get closer to equality, this tension only strengthens.

However, **this conflict between the sexes is really just a manifestation of inner conflict.** Because we’re so young when we start repressing, **sometimes, we don’t even realize we’ve lost parts of ourselves until we meet people who aren’t as repressed**, or we hit midlife and realize we’re missing something.

In the law, we’ll study some basics of gender, including the anima and animus. Then, we’ll learn how to use this knowledge to control our own nature.

### Study the Law: Learn About the Anima and Animus

According to psychologist Carl Jung, **we all have an internal entity called the anima (our repressed feminine tendencies) or animus (our repressed masculine tendencies).** We tend to fall in love with people who embody our anima or animus because we want to get closer to our opposite both internally and externally.

- For example, Chopin was more feminine and George Sand more masculine, and they complemented each other.

When in love, our repressed traits come to the surface. To outsiders, it might look like we’re behaving out of character, but in fact, we’re being more authentic because we’re displaying _all_ our traits, not just the traits associated with one gender. As a result, most of us change in the following ways:

- We focus on one person rather than the variety of topics we’re usually absorbed by.
- We act childishly and feel childish fear.
- We badly judge other people’s characters and don’t listen to anyone who tries to set us straight.
- We don’t understand why we’re doing any of the above.
- Our self-opinions become more malleable.

(We don’t necessarily need another person to see our anima or animus—we can fall in love with ourselves.)

#### Identify Projections

**To see our own anima or animus and work towards letting it free so we’re not possessed but balanced, we can analyze who we fall for.** Our choice of lover has a lot to do with our relationship with our parent of the opposite sex. If the relationship was ambivalent, we’ll look for someone who has the same qualities but whom we might be able to fix. If the relationship was negative, we’ll look for people who are the opposite of our parents.

As a result, **we rarely see people as they are—instead, we project qualities onto them that they don’t actually have.** Projecting is automatic and it’s not inherently bad—it’s how we start relationships with people of the opposite sex.

Learning about projections is important for four reasons:

**1. You’ll be able to identify what you’re projecting on others**, which will help you stop doing it. If you don’t clear your projections, you’ll never get to know the real person.

**2. You’ll be able to understand how others project on you.** When you become aware that someone’s projecting, don’t try to fit their image. It will be uncomfortable to not be yourself, you won’t get credit for your real qualities, and you’ll become resentful.

- For example, if a man’s mother nurtured him, he’ll look for or project nurturing qualities onto you. He’s not falling in love with you so much as the side of himself he repressed while growing up (it wasn’t manly to be nurturing like his mother).

**3. You’ll be able to see what people are repressing.** When you meet someone who’s strongly masculine or feminine, you can assume their anima or animus will be just as strong.

- Example #1: Hypermasculine Richard Nixon presented himself as macho but was interested in people’s suits and the color of the drapes in his office.
- Example #2: Hyperfeminine women are repressing a lot of aggression that comes from having to play a role. They’re passive-aggressive and try to dominate others, including in what might appear to be a very feminine way, like acting girlish.

**4. You’ll be able to better understand how others react to those of the opposite sex.** This will help you influence people.

Here are the six common types of projections:

##### Women’s Projections

The following three projections are what women project onto men:

**Type #1: The Charmer**

This imaginary man is older, successful, a bit of a rake, and romantic. He’ll want to change his ways and become respectable when he meets the right woman.

**The real men who inspire this projection are actually self-absorbed, irredeemable, and not as romantic as they first appear.** However, if they _were_ as attentive and romantic as the woman imagined, she’d think they were weak and boring.

Women who come up with this projection often had intense relationships with their fathers. They loved the attention they received (their fathers might have preferred them to their mothers because they were more playful) and they’ll be seeking this attention their entire lives. They also absorb their father's aggressive, masculine edge.

- For example, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s father treated her more like a playmate than his daughter. He was a womanizer, a narcissist, handsome, and macho. Jacqueline was attracted to men who were, like her father, older and spirited.

**To stop this projection, women must notice the pattern of men they’re attracted to and stop idealizing their fathers.**

**Type #2: The Bad Boy**

This imaginary man is young, unconventional, dislikes authority, and fathers don’t approve of him. He _looks_ rebellious with tattoos and a shaved head.

**The real man underneath this projection isn’t rebellious so much as lazy,** and that’s why he doesn’t have a conventional job. He can be controlling.

Women who use this projection often had strict, conventional, critical fathers who repressed their daughter’s rebelliousness. As a result, these women look for rebelliousness outside themselves.

**To stop projecting this type, women must develop their own rebelliousness and assertiveness.** They can do this by breaking small rules and saying no to people.

**Type #3: The Confident Intellectual**

This imaginary man is smart, confident, powerful, and dependable. He may be older and not physically attractive, but his allure is his self-assurance.

In reality, these men don’t possess the imagined qualities, or if they do, they only possess them in weaker concentrations.

- For example, in _Middlemarch_, Dorothea Brooke falls for Edward Causabon, a Confident Intellectual. He’s older, wealthy, academic, and unattractive. She wants to marry him because she can learn from him. In reality, he’s controlling and treats her badly.

Women who use this projection have low self-esteem because they’ve taken to heart criticism from others, especially their fathers. Because they lack their own confidence, they search for it externally.

**To avoid this projection, women need to acknowledge that they’ve internalized inaccurate criticism.** They can develop self-confidence by learning a new skill or working at a project. They need to learn to see themselves as equal to men.

##### Men’s Projections

Men project the following profiles on women:

**Type #1: The Perfect Woman**

This vague, imaginary woman will give the man everything his previous relationships (including the one with his mother) have lacked. However, he can’t articulate exactly what was lacking.

The real women who inspire this fantasy are usually narcissistic and independent, or free-spirited without a defined identity. They’re never perfect, because no one is, and the man is always disappointed and moves on.

Men who come up with this projection often had mothers who didn’t give them enough attention. Some of them may have been expected to give their mother's attention because they weren’t getting it from their husbands. These men’s feminine sides are introspective.

**To stop this projection, men need to spend more time with real, flawed women.** They need to give up control. When they need a muse, they need to look at their own anima and get closer to their feminine side.

**Type #2: The Damsel in Distress**

This imaginary woman seems to need rescuing and is unlike any other woman the man has ever met. She often comes from a lower class or different culture, and the man finds a way to idealize her.

- For example, in _In Search of Lost Time_, Charles Swann meets a woman named Odette who’s uneducated, crude, and fascinating. He decides she reminds him of a woman in a Botticelli painting and decides to marry her to rescue her. He badly misread her, though—she’s strong and smart and takes control of him.

Men who come up with this projection often had strong mothers. They have paradoxical feelings about their lovers—they think they want to be with someone like their mother, but they’re more attracted to sexy women, so they come up with a way to make sexy women classier. They think they want to help or rescue their lovers, but in fact, they crave danger.

**To stop this projection, men need to develop their own feminine side**—they’re attracted to playful, sensuous women because they don’t have any of those qualities themselves. They need to try new experiences, even dangerous ones.

**Type #3: The Worshipper**

This imaginary woman is kind, is attentive, and admires the man. She provides comfort to his difficult life.

The real women who inspire this projection don't possess the imagined qualities to the degree that the man wants, even if he manipulates her into playing a mothering role. Eventually, when it becomes obvious the woman isn’t prepared to be his mother, he thinks that she’s changed or misled him. She’s resentful. When they break up, it will be painful for the man because it feels like being abandoned by his mother.

Men who project this usually had an adoring, attentive mother. As they grow up, they try to meet their mothers’ expectations and are looking for women who can provide the same support their mothers did.

**To avoid this projection, the man must notice the pattern. He needs to realize that he pushes himself too hard (to please his mother)** and develop his own comforting qualities.

### Control Your Own Nature: Become Balanced

Now that we have a better sense of our repressed masculine or feminine traits, it’s time to look at how to stop repressing and find balance. One good way to do this is to try to use both masculine and feminine approaches when it comes to thinking, taking action, self-assessing, and joining a group.

**Throughout history, men have been the ones to define gender roles and their relative values.** According to men, the masculine methods of doing things were correct, and the feminine methods were irrational and weak. This resulted in women thinking that to be equal meant being more like men. However, **both approaches are equally valid in all circumstances.**

Here are some comparisons between styles of:

#### Thinking

Masculine thinking is linear and focuses on categorizing things, analyzing individual parts, specializing, and discounting emotion.

Feminine thinking tends to focus on context and how things are related to each other. It takes the senses and emotions into account.

**Most people gravitate towards one approach or the other, but the most successful thinkers use both** approaches:

- Example #1: Anthropologist Margaret Mead lived with indigenous cultures to understand what they were like and also used abstract models.
- Example #2: Businessman Warren Buffett considers intangibles, such as employee relationships, as well as statistics when considering buying a company.

**To create this balance in yourself, try whatever approach is the opposite of what you usually do.** For example, if you’re a masculine thinker, try to pay attention to your intuition. If you’re a feminine thinker, focus on a specific problem.

#### Action

Masculine action is to attack and overcome obstacles, often independently.

Feminine action is to take a step back and analyze all the possibilities, one of which might be a way to win without fighting. In the West, this style is often seen as weak, but in other cultures, it’s wise.

- For example, when Spain launched its armada towards England, Queen Elizabeth I chose to assess the situation before doing anything. When she realized that the weather could destroy a lot of the Spanish ships for her, she concentrated on slowing the armada’s advance so that the storms would destroy it.

**To create this balance in yourself, again try whatever approach is the opposite of what comes naturally.** For example, if your style is masculine, don’t act right away. Consider how all the players involved will react. If your style is feminine, make sure that when you avoid conflict, it’s strategic, not because you’re scared of confrontation. Practice confrontation in every day, low-stakes situations. Don’t consider the other person’s feelings, don’t be deferential, and be aggressive.

#### Self-Assessment

Masculine self-assessment tends to involve grandiosity (overestimating abilities, taking credit for all successes, and blaming others for failure). Men have trouble learning from failure or asking for help when they encounter a problem.

Feminine self-assessment tends to involve inward focus. Women find it easy to ask for help and attribute their success to a group effort.

To create this balance, **men should try looking for their own role in failures and others’ roles in their successes.** They should also try to get a more accurate picture of themselves—if they’re not as great as they think, they’ll be motivated to actually improve. **Women should let go of past criticism,** which might make them less inclined to try new things. They should also try not to take things personally.

#### Group Behavior

Masculine group behavior includes forming a hierarchy and trying to get as close to the top as possible. Leaders emphasize goals and results.

Feminine group behavior includes considering the feelings of everyone in the group. The process is just as important as the results.

**Men should try the feminine approach, and women should occasionally stop listening to others and expel the negative people in the group.**

> Extended Example: Caterina Sforza
> 
> Italian noblewoman Caterina Sforza was born in 1463 and grew up in a castle with her father and stepmother. **Unlike most girls of the time, she developed both her feminine and masculine sides and stepped outside gender roles**, which would have dictated that she become a mother and wife, religious devotee, or a courtesan. Instead, she became a ruler.
> 
> **Caterina turned out balanced partly because she had a lot of freedom and male influence during her childhood.** She adored her father, who was also fairly gender-balanced. (He was fearless, powerful, diplomatic, artistic, fashionable, and moved to tears by choral music.) She came to share many of his interests, and he had her tutored in military history, sword fighting, and hunting, which helped her develop her animus.
> 
> When Caterina’s father was murdered, she moved to Rome to live with her husband, Girolamo. **Everyone in Rome was fascinated by her because she was so well-rounded and unconstrained**—she was fashionable, well-read, caring, and influential. It fell to her to gain the pope’s favor and secure her family’s position because her husband was too weak and hotheaded.
> 
> When the pope died, Caterina and her family were in danger because they’d lost their only protection. Girolamo was technically still in control of the papal armies until the new pope was elected, but **he was too indecisive to make a call. Caterina took over** even though she was seven months pregnant. She snuck into the city and took over Castel Sant’Angelo, which had enough firepower to block the roads leading to the Vatican. The cardinals couldn’t gather to elect a new pope until the cannons were pointed elsewhere, and after 11 days, **they were forced to negotiate with Caterina, who wore armor and a sword over her dress.**
> 
> Caterina continued to use a mix of feminine and masculine styles to maintain power and manage her enemies. For example, when mercenary Cesare Borgia attacked her castle, **she first tried to avoid a conflict by trying to trap him on her drawbridge by flirting with him. When that didn’t work, she turned to the more masculine method of sword fighting.**
