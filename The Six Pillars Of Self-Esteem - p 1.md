# The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem

[Back to Discover](https://www.shortform.com/app)

## Pillar #1: Live With Awareness

Branden’s first pillar of self-esteem is to live consciously, or live with awareness. In this section, you’ll first learn what living with awareness is and why it’s important. Then, you’ll learn how to use sentence-completion exercises to make living with awareness easier.

### What Is Living With Awareness?

Branden explains that **when you live with awareness, you look for information about the external and internal realities that affect your life, accept them, and act** **accordingly**. For example, you take control of your finances by checking your bank account and adjusting your budget as needed. If you don’t look for information about these realities, you’re not living with awareness—you’re choosing _ignorance_ instead. If you learn relevant information and don’t react appropriately, you’re also not living with awareness—you’re still denying reality on some level.

(Shortform note: Consider developing a consistent system to help you pay attention to and act on the realities of your life, as life coach Brendon Burchard recommends in _[High Performance Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-performance-habits/)_: Every week, [chart your work-life balance](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/high-performance-habits/habit-4#chart-your-work-life-balance) by ranking your happiness levels in 10 areas, like work and family, then write down your goals for the next week in each area.)

Branden specifies that living with awareness involves _situational_ awareness: **You’re aware of everything that’s important in a particular situation and act accordingly.** As such, you simultaneously choose _not_ to pay attention to unimportant stimuli, which allows you to live in the moment. For example, if you’re focused on reading this guide, ignoring the room’s temperature is a sign you’re living with awareness—unless your teeth are chattering.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, things seem important but are just pressing. For example, if you’re working on an important presentation, a phone call from your boss about the presentation is both important and pressing, but a phone call from her about the holiday party may just be pressing. To determine whether something is important or merely pressing, [plot out the difference with the graph](https://shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first#the-significance-vs-pressure-graph) recommended by productivity expert Stephen R. Covey in _[First Things First](https://shortform.com/app/book/first-things-first)_.)

Branden names several more specific habits you implement when you live with awareness.

**1. You use your mind.** You choose to think for yourself and to look for knowledge. (Shortform note: One way to do this is to learn about the [unconscious biases that affect our decisions](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow#important-biases-and-heuristics), which Kahneman describes in _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://shortform.com/app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow)_. Understanding these biases is an act of awareness that can help you make better decisions.)

**2. You’re always learning** because you know it’s necessary to maintain awareness of reality in an ever-changing world. You’re curious about the world around you and open to new ideas. You seek information that could alter your life and respond appropriately if you encounter it. You prioritize the truth instead of your ego, so you readily admit when you’re wrong. (Shortform note: In _[Ego Is The Enemy](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/)_, Ryan Holiday warns that your ego can convince you that you know everything—but even someone who’s mastered a skill can find new ways to improve. He recommends [becoming a mentor to someone more junior than you](https://shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-1b#become-a-lifelong-student): The experience of teaching what you know improves your understanding of it and encourages you to grow.)

**3. You know that what you _believe_ isn’t necessarily _true._** For example, if your friend doesn’t text you, you may believe she doesn’t care about you. But just because you _believe_ this doesn’t make it true—maybe she had an emergency. (Shortform note: If you’re having trouble discerning the difference, try the litmus test presented by researchers Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen in _[Difficult Conversations](https://shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/)_: A fact is [measurable and verifiable](https://shortform.com/app/book/difficult-conversations/appendix#q1-is-everything-relative). Everything else is subjective.)

**4. You try to understand yourself.** You pay attention to your feelings, emotions, and behaviors, and you act on what they reveal. (Shortform note: If you don’t know how you feel about something, try the head/heart technique: [Notice your thoughts, then direct your attention to your heart area](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotion-information/201806/head-heart-repeat#:~:text=Now%20shift%20back%20down%20again%20to%20your,what%20you%20sensed%20before%20is%20what%20you). Do any feelings arise? These can be pure emotion or physical cues that indicate emotion—like a fluttering in your heart.)

**5. You try to face unpleasant realities when necessary.** You may occasionally succumb to the temptation of avoiding these painful realities—but as long as you sincerely _attempt_ to face them, you’re living with awareness. (Shortform note: If you suspect you’re avoiding something, ask yourself questions like, [“What dark secrets about myself have I never told anyone?"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201904/how-know-your-emotional-truth#:~:text=to%20figure%20out%20what%20your%20emotional,What%20are%20some%20dark%20secrets%20about))

**6. You persist when you inevitably encounter difficulties**, instead of giving up or making a half-hearted effort. That said, if you stop pursuing a goal because you lack the time or energy required to resolve the challenges involved, you’re still living with awareness. (Shortform note: Persevering when you encounter difficulties is an element of grit, which psychologist Angela Duckworth defines as a combination of perseverance and passion. In _[Grit](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit)_, she contends that [this perseverance doubles your success](https://shortform.com/app/book/grit#how-effort-affects-success)—first because perseverance increases your talent, and then because it increases the application of that talent.)

**7. You practice deep breathing and relaxation techniques** in order to fully embrace and feel your emotions. Branden explains that when you block your emotions, you breathe more shallowly and tighten your muscles. The longer you live without awareness of your emotions, the more ingrained these physical habits become—and eventually, you become _incapable_ of feeling as much as you used to. Techniques like deep breathing reverse this pattern: You become physically able to feel more, so you’re able to be more aware of your emotions.

(Shortform note: Physically reconnecting with your body may be especially important for trauma survivors, who are [prone to low self-esteem](https://khironclinics.com/blog/trauma-and-low-self-esteem/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20study%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthe,decline%20in%20self%2Desteem%E2%80%9D.). In _[The Body Keeps the Score](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/)_, researcher Bessel van der Kolk contends that [trauma survivors suffer major disconnection from their bodies](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/chapter-6), and it’s only [by becoming aware of and responding to their physicality that they can work through their trauma](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/chapter-6#trauma-survivors-must-reconnect-with-their-bodies).)

### Why Living With Awareness Matters

You’ve now learned what living with awareness is—but why does it matter?

Branden argues that **living with awareness is the foundation of self-esteem**. Every day, you make decisions that either do or don’t demonstrate a commitment to conscious living: You live with awareness by not buying a drink you can’t afford, then do the opposite by avoiding a necessary but tough conversation. Although you don’t consciously remember most of these decisions because you make so many of them, each decision either nurtures or chips away at your self-esteem—and, collectively, they determine your self-esteem.

(Shortform note: Branden’s explanation suggests that living with awareness improves your self-esteem by improving your self-efficacy: You react appropriately to your reality, so you make better decisions. With each good decision you make, you gather evidence that you’re capable—which increases your confidence that you’ll be capable in the future, and thus your self-esteem.)

Moreover, Branden contends that **living without awareness can lead to addiction**: You turn to addictive substances to reduce your awareness of your pain. But the tools of your addiction only blunt your pain temporarily. Afterward, your pain returns more powerfully than before—so you need even more of your substance to dull your awareness of it. Branden adds that addiction is only _possible_ if you live without awareness: You only knowingly do something bad for you if you _ignore_ the reality that it’s bad for you.

(Shortform note: Like Branden, psychologist Tara Brach contends that addiction is an attempt to escape pain. However, in _[Radical Acceptance](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/)_, she argues that [addiction stems primarily from an inability to accept yourself](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-1). As we’ll see, Branden also discusses the importance of accepting yourself but doesn’t directly link it to addiction.)

### Exercises to Help You Live With Awareness

How can you live with greater awareness? Branden recommends sentence-completion exercises, which is a tool used in therapy and in psychological research. For two weeks, when you wake up, brainstorm six to 10 endings to prompts, or “sentence stems,” like the ones listed below. These endings don’t need to be unique or meaningful, just grammatically correct. Write quickly without self-editing, spending no more than 10 minutes on the exercise. (Shortform note: We’ve included a selection of Branden’s full list of sentence stems for this exercise. He has several more in his books, as well as on [his Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/nbranden?lang=en).)

- To me, living consciously means...
- If I am a little more aware of my activities today…
- If I am more aware of how I relate to others today...

Don’t review your answers. When you finish, go about your day as normal. Then, each weekday evening, write six to 10 endings to sentence stems like the ones below.

- When I reflect on how I would feel if I lived more consciously…
- When I reflect on what happens when I am a little more aware of my activities…
- When I reflect on what happens when I am a little more aware of my relationships…

Don’t re-read any of your answers during the week, and don’t worry about repeating some answers. Each weekend, review your weekday writing and write at least six endings to the following prompt:

- If any of what I wrote this week is true, it would be helpful if I…

Branden contends that **completing** **these exercises will naturally improve your self-esteem**. He explains that we all have a well of knowledge we can’t immediately access. Completing these prompts allows us to tap into that well: Knowing you have to reflect each day on how greater awareness would improve your life increases how aware you are, improving your self-esteem.

Branden believes that once you complete the two-week program, you’ll have a solid understanding of how sentence completion works. You can then develop your own prompts to improve your consciousness in areas where you’re struggling with awareness.

> **How Sentence-Completion Improves Your Self-Esteem**
> 
> Scholars theorize that doing [sentence-completion exercises improves both your self-awareness and your self-responsibility](http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/walterfoddis/sentencecompletioncounseling.html)—and since these are two pillars of self-esteem, this would explain why Branden believes that these exercises improve your self-esteem.
> 
> First, psychologists contend that by doing sentence-completion exercises, you naturally gain a greater awareness of your inner psychic life, which may propel behavior change: The more aware you become of some behavior, the more motivated you become to improve that behavior, so the greater your likelihood of changing it.
> 
> Second, psychologists argue that doing sentence-completion exercises encourages you to take responsibility—which, as we’ll learn later, is a pillar of self-esteem. They attribute this to the fact that the self-awareness you gain through _your actions_ is a greater impetus for change than a therapist’s prodding.
