# Antifragile

## Chapters 8-11: The Fragility of Predictions

Forecasting or predicting the future is notoriously hard to do. Consider the infamous inaccuracy of weather forecasts, and then realize that those are based on much more concrete information than, for example, a large company’s financial projections for the coming year.

So much of our modern obsession with control is based on forecasting—predicting upcoming events so that we can be ready for them or, better still, prevent them. However, actions taken based on these inaccurate forecasts are often more harmful than helpful. If you’ve ever trusted a forecast that says the day will be clear and sunny, then gotten rained on because you didn’t bring an umbrella, you understand how that can happen.

### Fragility and Forecasting

Fragile systems, such as modern societies, rely almost exclusively on forecasting. They can’t withstand shocks, so they must know how to avoid them. Of course, given how unreliable those forecasts are, the systems are inevitably damaged by unforeseen problems. That’s one of the main reasons why hidden instabilities build up in tightly controlled systems.

However, durable and antifragile systems don’t have any such reliance. For example, a country that always keeps surplus food stores—remember that antifragility often works by overcompensation—won’t be ruined by a famine. However, a country that waits until it thinks a famine is coming to start storing extra food will, inevitably, be caught off-guard sooner or later and suffer terribly for it.

**Since predicting the future is difficult, if not impossible, it makes much more sense to seek out and embrace durability and antifragility.** In other words, we don’t need to know exactly what will happen next, we just need to minimize the damage we suffer from unforeseen events. The question mustn’t be why we didn’t see a disaster coming, but why we built a system that was so vulnerable to it. The fragile country from the previous example might ask why it never saved any food in case of an emergency—the answer, most likely, is “efficiency.” It was more efficient (in the short term) not to waste resources growing extra food, or to sell off any surplus.

On a similar note, the answers to society’s problems can’t be to make people “better,” by eliminating greed, for example. Humanity has been trying to do that for millennia and gotten nowhere. **Rather, we must rethink society so that it is immune to, or even strengthened by, people’s shortcomings.** Notably, that’s what capitalism was supposed to do: turn human greed into a driving force for improvement by letting people create and sell what they could, as best as they were able to.

At any rate, this naturally raises the question of how we can create something that is resistant or antifragile in the face of failure. **The answer is to plan with failure in mind.** Nuclear engineers realized this after the Fukushima disaster, and they started building smaller reactors with better protections around them. They designed these new reactors under the assumption that they _would_ fail and melt down, and therefore they made sure that the damage would be minimal when that happened. The added protections are costly—inefficient, one might say—but more than worth it.

#### Out-Predicting the Predictors

This section moves away from talk of science, economics, and politics. Instead, it brings the topic down to a personal level by introducing two characters: Nero Tulip and Tony DiBenedetto, also known as Fat Tony. Nero and Tony are two men with almost nothing in common, except a shared love of going out for lunch and a lack of anyone else to dine with.

Nero is an intellectual. He comes from old money and spends his days buying, reading, and discussing books about nearly everything. Tony, on the other hand, might never have read a book in his life. He’s an outgoing man with a powerful personality who makes friends easily and, more importantly, reads people easily.

The one thing these two agree on, aside from the importance of lunch, is the fact that predictions and the people who rely on them are bound to fail. Nero came to this conclusion through long years of study and observation, while Tony had a more intuitive understanding of the situation—in his words, that people who rely on predictions are suckers.

These two men made fortunes during the worldwide recession of 2008 by using a sort of meta-prediction: They didn’t foresee the details of the economic crisis, but they knew that sooner or later, the predictive models that the economic world ran on would fail catastrophically.

They didn’t know that it would happen in 2008 specifically, nor exactly what form that failure would take. They didn’t need to. Their strategy was simply to do the opposite of what the fragile capitalists and economists were doing at any given time. They might lose small amounts of money along the way, but when the predictions inevitably collapsed, Tony and Nero would win big.

In 2008 the wager paid off, and they raked in millions of dollars. **In short, by recognizing and rejecting fragility, they became antifragile.**

### Nobody Knows Where They’re Going

One of the great fallacies people fall prey to is assuming that they know what they want, and where they want to go in life. We can call this the _teleological fallacy_ (from _telos_: “based on the end”).

The teleological fallacy is related to the earlier topic of touristification—after all, the entire premise of tourism is that you know where you want to go and what you want to see. A tourist, especially one traveling with a tour group, has a set schedule for every moment of the trip, designed to maximize how much she can see and experience while she’s there.

However, people who lock themselves into such rigid plans become fragile; unexpected changes or problems can have disproportionately large impacts, simply because the plans can’t adapt. If a destination on the tour suddenly becomes unsafe, or is under construction, or can’t be visited for whatever reason, there’s no opportunity to go someplace else instead. The chance is simply lost, and the time and money wasted.

Flexibility is more important than efficiency. Someone who plans the next step of her trip while enjoying the current one is much better able to adapt to changing circumstances and make the most of every situation as it comes up. This holds true in business, economics, politics, and almost every other area of life—though not in personal relationships, where loyalty and commitment should be the order of the day.

In short, avoiding the teleological fallacy requires embracing its opposite: _optionality_, the ability to consider and choose from among the available options at any given time. This concept will be explored in detail in the next chapter.

#### Seneca and Stoicism

A couple thousand years before Nero and Tony, the philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca, better known as Seneca the Younger, found antifragility in a different way. Seneca was a prominent Stoic, from a school of philosophy whose followers try to remain indifferent in the face of hardship and good fortune alike.

His method for doing so was to consider his material goods already lost, even though he was fabulously rich. That way, if his fortunes suffered a slight decline, he wasn’t concerned with the loss because he’d mentally and emotionally written off those goods long ago.

This set him in contrast to most people who, once they reach a certain level of wealth, become obsessed with holding on to as much of it as possible. **At this point the pain of losing their money far outweighs the satisfaction of making more; they have much more to lose than they have to gain.** Therefore, they are fragile, vulnerable to chance and misfortune. Seneca, by considering his possessions already lost, avoided this trap.

However, rejecting his goods—and therefore fragility—would only bring Seneca to the level of durability, not antifragility. How could he actually _benefit_ from the random whims of fate? As it turns out, that question goes hand in hand with another: Why, if he placed no value on his riches, did he bother to keep them?

The answer is, simply, that he wanted to experience the good that his riches would bring him. The fact that he was (supposedly) able to do so without the fear of losing them speaks to his success as a Stoic. Therefore, Seneca benefited from chance without being harmed by it. **He always had more to gain than to lose.** In short, he was antifragile.

This gets to the very nature of antifragility. Something or someone who has more to gain than to lose will, on average, benefit from volatility and random chance. The next section will address how to put this method of reducing downsides while increasing upsides into practice.

### Understanding Path-Dependence

Consider a fragile package that gets dropped and broken. It doesn’t magically repair itself when you pick it up off the ground. The damage is irreversible; therefore, getting the package safely to its destination requires performing the right sequence of tasks in the right order. You have to pad and protect it, carry the package carefully, and store it securely. Doing any of those things out of order greatly increases the chance that the object inside will break.

**A situation like this, where it’s not just the destination but the entire sequence of events that matters, is called path-dependent.** For another example of path-dependence, imagine getting surgery first and then receiving anesthesia. Clearly, your experience would be a lot different—and a lot worse—than if those events had happened in the other order.

Therefore, the first step toward reducing downsides in business, economics, or anywhere else, is to consider the path that your venture is going to take. If your country’s economy grows rapidly, but is left vulnerable to a sudden collapse and recession (like America in 1929), then your growth is meaningless. It would be better to grow more slowly—or not at all—and put safeguards in place to make sure that a sudden downturn doesn’t wipe away all of your profits.

To see how this is path-dependent, consider that a country can very easily grow its GDP by saddling future generations with immense debt (again, America provides a good example with student loans). However, this will inevitably cause harm in the long term when those debts need to be repaid by people who can’t afford to do so. On the other hand, GDP growth in Europe before and during the Industrial Revolution was quite slow—relatively speaking—but it wasn’t fragile. The continent is still reaping the benefits of the growth it experienced, and it’s one of the dominant powers in the world even today.

#### The Barbell Model

A good antifragile model—again, for business, economics, or what have you—is in the shape of a barbell. A barbell is a long pole loaded with weights near either end; similarly, an antifragile model is a combination of extremes with an appropriate amount of distance between them.

One end of the “barbell” is extremely safe measures, the other is high-risk, high-reward behavior. For example, if you keep 90% of your savings safe in the bank, and invest 10% in extremely volatile stocks with a chance of massive payoff, then you can never lose more than 10% of your money—while, at the same time, having the chance to earn a lot more. However, if you put all of your money into medium-risk, medium-return stocks (putting your weights in the middle of the barbell, as it were), you run the risk of losing everything to a market downturn, or simply an unexpectedly bad investment.

Seneca used this same model to manage his emotional investments, though he never used the term “barbell” to describe it. By emotionally detaching himself from his wealth (risk-avoidance) while still spending and enjoying it (risk-taking) he was able to maximize his upsides and minimize his downsides. A Yiddish proverb gives similar advice: Prepare for the worst, and let the best take care of itself.

Many artists and writers also adopt a barbell strategy, often without even realizing it. They invest most of their time and energy into some stable, non-artistic job that will provide them a steady income. With whatever time and energy they have left, they pursue their art and hope to hit it big (or just enjoy the process, depending on whom you ask).

In contrast, pursuing some middle-of-the-road strategy, which generally means creating their art by someone else’s standards and for someone else’s benefit, inevitably changes and corrupts their artistic visions—what some people would call “selling out.”

**An effective barbell strategy is any combination of two extremes, with strict avoidance of the middle.** Another way to think of it is, antifragility equals aggressiveness plus paranoia. Protect yourself from disaster first, then take any resources you have left and use them to chase after the greatest gain possible. With this strategy, you can make sure that random chance will, on average, work in your favor. **“Cautious optimism,” where you put all your resources into something that “should” work and then hope for the best, is to be avoided at any cost.**

This concept also applies to social policies. **The ideal social policies would protect and take care of the poor and weak, those most in need of protection, while letting the rich and strong get on with their business.** Policies that protect the middle class while ignoring the poor inevitably lead to economic harm, and stifle growth.

Finally, remember that antifragility needs stress and danger in order to work. Therefore, while putting the weights on your barbell, make sure you’re not being _too_ paranoid. Protect yourself from disaster, but don’t stress yourself out about small dangers. If, for example, your investments lose you a few dollars instead of getting you more money, then so be it. The investments are worth the risk.

Think about the old adage of the child who touches the hot stove once, and only once. That small amount of danger was necessary in order for the child to learn, to become stronger and more prepared for the future. Remember that trying too hard to manage small risks actually increases your fragility. **Therefore, the barbell model isn’t about getting rid of uncertainty, it’s about taming it—making sure that it can’t hurt you (much), and that it’ll generally work to your advantage.**
