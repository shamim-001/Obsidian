## Law #4: People Wear Masks

Now that we understand how to observe and interpret nonverbal cues, it’s time to look at some of the traits and feelings almost everyone hides.

No one acts true to themselves all the time. Starting from birth, we learn how to use our faces and bodies to get our parents to give us things, and we continue to act throughout our lives to fit into society. **Acting completely honestly would result in social ruin—we would offend people and open ourselves up to so much judgment and insecurity it would affect our mental health.**

We hide our negative feelings—such as superiority or insecurity—with words and sometimes mixed signals. A lot of the time we don’t even know we’re acting, and this conviction is part of what makes the mask believable.

However, **no matter how good we are at hiding our feelings and masking, our real feelings are underneath somewhere, and they’re impossible to fully suppress,** especially when we’re stressed, tired, angry, frustrated, or drunk. Accurate nonverbal cues leak out, often in microexpressions or in the tone of voice—people can look in mirrors to train their faces, but the voice is harder to change. Learn to spot these leaks and you’ll be able to uncover people’s real natures, as well as better mask your own.

Many people dislike the idea of acting or mask-wearing because it feels dishonest, but there are four reasons to study it:

1. Mask-wearing is impossible to avoid. Everyone acts, often subconsciously, so there’s no point getting upset about this because you can’t change it. If you don’t think you wear masks, think about how you interact with different people. You almost certainly behave differently with your boss than with your best friend.
2. Mask-wearing can help you get ahead because it shows you in a positive light.
3. If you don’t learn about mask-wearing, you’re vulnerable to being fooled by others.
4. Those who choose not to mask are pushed to the fringes of society.
5. Learning to see through masks will help you predict people. When someone does something hostile, there are always signs beforehand because strong emotions are impossible to entirely hide.

In this law, we’ll learn to make people like us, manage toxic types, and control our own nature.

### Make People Like You: Impression Management

You can make people like you by wearing an appealing mask, which is also called impression management. **Impression management is especially important in professional situations because people associate certain behaviors with certain professions, and if their expectations are contradicted, they suspect a lack of competence.** For example, if your doctor started acting like a rock musician, you might worry about her ability to diagnose illness. Even people who seem rebellious are subject to this suspicion—if a hipster suddenly wore a suit, others would question her authenticity as a hipster.

**Once you’ve proven your identity and competence, you can start to show more of your true self and quirks, but you can never completely take the mask off.** To continue succeeding socially, you have to continue to meet others’ expectations.

To create your mask:

**1. Demonstrate universally positive traits.** There are some traits that everyone sees as positive, and a good one to demonstrate is saintliness, which you can do by supporting causes, or by appearing humble by lowering your head or publicly sharing vulnerabilities.

- For example, Emperor Augustus gave away power to the people and the Senate, lived in a simple home, and embodied Roman values. (In reality, however, Augustus was playing a part. In his private life, he lived in a villa outside of Rome, had mistresses, and retained control of the military.)

**2. Cultivate first impressions.** People have a hard time changing their initial judgments, so make sure you appear positive the first time they encounter you. Aim to be neutral and don’t use a lot of nonverbal cues. Making eye contact and smiling are enough. If you’re too excited, people might think you’re insecure.

**3. Cater to your audience.** You need to keep your mask on no matter who you’re addressing, but there’s some wiggle room.

- For example, Bill Clinton consistently demonstrated confidence and power because these were qualities people expected in a president, but he slightly changed his demeanor depending on whom he was talking to. He spoke differently to workers than he did to executives.

**4. Use appropriate nonverbal cues.** Be aware of your normal nonverbal communication and tweak it to match whatever role you need to play.

- For example, in a job interview, hide cues that indicate nervousness and display cues that demonstrate confidence, such as a tall posture.

**5. Learn method acting,** in which you show emotion on command. When you need to show an emotion, remember a time you genuinely felt it. This will make you feel the appropriate emotion enough to show cues. Or, arrange your face into a smile or frown, which will make you feel the emotion that prompts these expressions. Also, teach yourself to _stop_ feeling emotion and showing cues.

**6. If you’re seeking power, control how often people encounter you and how well they get to know you.** When people see you a lot or you’re predictable, they get bored. Purposefully be absent, withhold information, or show slightly contradictory qualities to create mystery. (For more on these techniques, see Law #15: People Want What They Don’t Have.)

### Manage Toxic Types: Learn About the Shadow

**The qualities we try to hide are called the Shadow.** Our Shadows developed in childhood as we learned from our parents which behavior was acceptable and which wasn’t. Because we depended on our parents for survival, we didn’t dare do anything that would make them abandon us, so we hid the things about ourselves that they didn’t like.

As we grew up, we experienced pressure from friends, mentors, and our culture to behave in certain ways (or else be left out of the group), so we repressed more. **Typically, we learned that we had to hide aggression, overambition, arrogance, vengefulness, and other emotions society perceives as negative.**

**Most of us successfully mask these socially inappropriate characteristics, but they don’t disappear.** There are moments when our Shadows sneak through our masks, and we become so different it’s almost as if we’re possessed. Additionally, as we get older, it becomes harder and harder to repress the Shadow because maintaining a mask is a lot of work and we tire of it. We secretly want to embrace the Shadow—when we were young, we felt freer and more creative, and we want these feelings back.

To spot people’s Shadow qualities, look out for:

- **Inconsistency.** When people act in a way that’s the opposite of how they normally are, there’s a good chance their Shadow is motivating that seemingly out-of-character action.
- **Hypocrisy.** When people vehemently deny that they like or are interested in something, this probably indicates that they feel the opposite. Be careful around people who have exaggerated qualities because they might, in truth, mean that the person is the opposite.
    - Example #1: People who are vulnerable or insecure develop exaggerated toughness to mask it.
    - Example #2: Antisocial people develop exaggerated social qualities to mask it.
- **Loss of control.** When people explode, overreact, or are more sensitive than usual, they might try to blame it on circumstances, such as stress, but it’s their Shadow sneaking out.
- **Can’t-help-it behavior.** When people express their Shadow, sometimes they try to blame it on something they can’t control, like an addiction or illness.
- **Ends-justify-the-means attitude.** Some people chose a leader, cause, or argument to support and they justify the release of their Shadow as a means of furthering the cause. They can then excuse any behavior.
    - For example, someone who secretly wants to bully people might get into an argument about one of their convictions and use the strength of their belief as an excuse to insult others.
- **Projection.** When we want something but can’t admit to our desire, we imagine that other people have this desire (either by exaggerating one of their existing qualities or completely making one up) and then judging them. This judgment is a way of venting our own desires. This is the most common way to release the Shadow because it’s the easiest and most accessible.
    - For example, composer Richard Wagner claimed to hate Jewish people’s influences on Western music, such as their sentimentality. In reality, there wasn’t much sentimentality in Western music, but Wagner was sentimental himself.

You’ll see these cues over and over when someone is trying to hide their Shadow. **Usually, the harder someone is repressing, the more likely the Shadow is to break free.**

#### The Different Types of Masks

There are several types of masks, all used to repress the Shadow:

##### Manly Man

**These types of men create a tough exterior to hide their inner vulnerability.** They think they like to control women but secretly wish to be controlled by them. When their sensitive Shadow sneaks out, they’ll be embarrassed and act even tougher to make up for it.

To deal with these types, don’t be intimidated by their false toughness and don’t visibly doubt their stories and bragging because this will make them insecure. **To take them down, provoke them (which will be easy because they’re so insecure) into some embarrassing action.**

##### Do-Gooder

**These types act moral and compassionate, but they secretly want power and things that society considers taboo.** Their saintly mask can help them achieve a powerful position as a cult leader or politician, where they can reveal their true nature.

To deal with these types, first, establish whether they really are good people or whether they’re hiding a Shadow. Ignore what they say and look at their history—if they seem interested in power or wealth, they’re probably not actually saintly. **To avoid trouble, keep your distance, or if you need to take them down, reveal their hypocrisy to their followers and admirers.**

##### Polite But Power-Hungry

**These types are power-hungry, envious, and aggressive,** and they’re consciously aware of these tendencies. They’re also aware that they have to hide these qualities or they won’t get far in life, so **they act kind and accommodating.** This dichotomy is exhausting, so they’re prone to leakage, such as passive-aggressive comments.

To deal with these types, be cautious when you meet people who are initially overly friendly and **keep your distance. Study them carefully for any signs of leakage.**

##### The Extremist

**These leaders passionately and dramatically support a cause. In reality, however, they only believe in something else so strongly because they don’t believe in themselves.** They have such low self-worth that they don’t believe that they can actually make any progress on their cause, so they self-sabotage by becoming indecisive, making a mistake, or falling ill.

To handle these types, **remember that the more strongly someone professes belief in something, the more likely it is that they believe the opposite.**

##### Extreme Unbeliever

**These types fear irrationality and try to compensate by valuing science and analytical thinking. This valuing has a worship-like, religious element to it that’s in fact irrational.** Sometimes, the irrationality will break free as anger during an argument or a bad choice.

**To manage the intellectual superiority of these types, provoke them into an irrational reaction.**

##### The Player of Her Own Drum

These types want to be different, unique, or “alternative” and talk up their interesting backgrounds. **They’re insecure about the fact that their lives, like most of ours, include large doses of boringness.**

- For example, Beau Brummell, a dandy in the 19th century, claimed to be from the masses but actually came from the middle class.

**Suspect that people who try very hard to be different are in fact conventional.** People who actually are different don’t showboat it.

##### “Independent” Businessperson

**These types are outwardly self-reliant and appear to be good at their jobs**—they take on projects and have high standards. **In reality, however, they secretly crave dependence.** They hide this in their inability to delegate or collaborate, but as they take on too much work themselves, they create catastrophes that force them into a dependent position, such as needing the help of a doctor.

To manage these people, **avoid getting professionally involved with them**—when they fail, they take others down with them.

### Control Your Own Nature: Recognize Your Own Shadow

Hiding the Shadow is exhausting and inauthentic, and at a certain point, we lose control. If we can better understand the Shadow and even release it in small doses, we’ll be less prone to emotional explosion and feeling possessed.

To create a healthy relationship with your Shadow, there are four strategies:

**Strategy #1: Describe your Shadow.** This is hard to do because, by nature, the Shadow is something we repress. To see yours:

- **Apply what you’ve learned about identifying toxic types to yourself.** Do you fit any of the profiles? Start by looking for your most emphatic traits, assume they hide the opposite trait, and then look for leaks to confirm this.
- **Pay attention to your sensitivities.** If you’re sensitive to something, you’re probably insecure about it, and this insecurity is probably accompanied by a Shadow trait.
- **Identify your projections.** What qualities do you hate in others? Probably, this is something you’re repressing in yourself.
- **Reflect on your adolescence.** All of us had less control over our Shadow as we grew up, so look for moments when it might have snuck out. Also, consider what your parents or the people you knew might have tried to train out of you.
- **Pay attention to what other people see in you.** It’s often easier to see other people’s Shadows than our own, so other people’s opinions of you might offer some insight.
- **Analyze the emotional tone of your dreams.** Don’t worry about what actually happens in your dreams; instead, try to pick up on what they make you feel. Write them down so you can refer back to them later.

For example, writer and poet Robert Bly hated businesspeople and advertisers because they were devious and wily, but when he looked for his Shadow, he found that _he_ was devious and wily. He also paid attention to what other people said about him—they said his poetry was classical, and he thought the opposite, but when he reflected, he realized they were right.

**Strategy #2: Redirect it.** When the Shadow is bottled up, it becomes unstable, and you have no control over when it escapes. Let your Shadow qualities out in non-threatening (and potentially productive) ways.

- For example, Abraham Lincoln channeled his toughness into debates rather than duels.

**Strategy #3: Channel it into something creative.** Acknowledging and getting to know the Shadow allows us to be more creative because when we’re not repressing, we have more material to associate ideas with. Our conscious minds are more limited than our unconscious ones.

- For example, Albert Einstein was in touch with his Shadow and paid attention to his dreams. He once dreamed of an image that became part of one of the theories of relativity.

**Strategy #4: Release your Shadow occasionally.** Those who repress less tend to be more successful because they can make full use of their unconsciousness and appear authentic. To release the Shadow:

- Prioritize your own opinions more than others’, especially in fields where you’re an expert.
- Assert yourself more.
- Stop caring about other people’s opinions of you.
- Offend people if they’re being unjust.
- Mock people like you did when you were a child.
- Ignore social conventions, especially gender roles. For more on gender, see Law #7: People Have Both Masculine and Feminine Traits.

For example, Steve Jobs was difficult to work with because he showed his Shadow (for example, he didn’t listen to others). Despite his negative qualities, people still admire his work.

> **Extended Example: Richard Nixon**
> 
> **Richard Nixon so strongly repressed his Shadow that he had no control of it and it burst out at inopportune moments, eventually ruining his career.** People who worked with him said that he was so inconsistent it was as if he had two personalities.
> 
> Like all of us, **Nixon started to develop his Shadow in childhood. He was a needy crybaby and his parents didn’t approve of this**—they wanted their child to be self-reliant. **He disguised his vulnerability by creating a mask that was extra tough, masculine, and strong.** For example, he claimed that he never cried.
> 
> After Nixon was elected president, **he installed a taping system in the White House so that he would know what people were saying behind his back. However, the tapes also became a record of his Shadow side.** Being president came with so much pressure and stress that he found it harder to hide his vulnerabilities. He became touchy when journalists criticized him and he worried about his public image. He criticized people he considered his enemies and talked aggressively about taking them down.
> 
> When some of his staff got caught breaking into the Watergate hotel to bug one of Nixon’s enemies’ rooms, Nixon was paralyzed and frightened. He hadn’t ordered the break-in specifically, but he had asked his staff to do some spying and dirty work. He tried to cover up his involvement. **The secret tapes might clear his name, but they would also reveal his Shadow side to the public, and he couldn’t bear to have people see his true self.**
> 
> Eventually, Nixon had no choice but to reveal the tapes. When the public found out what he was really like, they were horrified. Nixon resigned.
