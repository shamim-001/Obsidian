## 8: Make the Most of Your Intelligence

Aside from _raising_ your IQ score, there are strategies you can use to _make the most_ of your intelligence with diligence, practice, and tools to help you remember information.

### Strategy #1: Growth Mindset

Grit and perseverance are far more important ingredients for success than intelligence. **People who have a “growth mindset” are empowered to take their success into their own hands because they understand that effort and discipline are critical to their learning potential.** These people work harder, take more risks, and view failures as learning opportunities.

On the other hand, people who have a “fixed mindset” have no sense of control over their own destinies because they believe that intelligence is the bottom-line determiner of success: They were either born with it or they weren’t. These people become helpless when they encounter failure because they attribute it to their lack of intelligence and ability.

Psychologist Carol Dweck studied this phenomenon and found several other characteristics associated with growth and fixed mindsets.

People with growth mindsets:

- Create _learning_ goals, which focus on gaining information and skills. **They set increasingly challenging goals in order to continually expand their knowledge.**
- Tend to receive praise for their _effort_, which encourages them to continue to work hard and persevere.

People with fixed mindsets:

- Create _performance_ goals, which focus on measurable achievements that validate their skills. They set more conservative goals to ensure they can achieve them and receive the validation they seek.
- Tend to receive praise for their _intelligence_, which discourages them from taking risks, for fear of blowing their image as an intelligent person.

(Shortform note: Read more about the growth mindset in our [summary of Mindset](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindset), and about the value and the building blocks of grit in our [summary of Grit](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/grit).)

### Strategy #2: Deliberate Practice

Mastery requires thousands of hours of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is more than mere repetition—it has several distinct characteristics, including:

- Being solitary
- Being goal-oriented
- Pushing past current ability

(Shortform note: [Read more about the power of deliberate practice in our summary of Peak](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/peak)_._)

**Pushing yourself, failing, troubleshooting, and trying again are necessary for building the skills and creating the mental models that lead to mastery.** Through deliberate practice, you gradually develop a repertoire of increasingly high-level skills that you can then apply in a wide variety of situations.

Although deliberate practice is generally most effective when it’s solitary, coaches and trainers can play pivotal roles in helping you to see your areas of weakness, providing corrective feedback, and pushing you to redouble your efforts on the areas where you’re struggling most.

### Strategy #3: Memory Cues

Memory cues are tools for shorthanding information that you need to remember. **Memory cues can help you remember facts on a surface level, but they’re most valuable as a way of organizing and retaining information that you’ve already mastered.** For example, you can use a mnemonic device to remember names and dates for a history test, but you won’t ace the test if you don’t understand the _significance_ of those names and dates.

Mnemonic devices are tools that range from simple to complex to remember various types of information. For example, the acronym ROY G BIV is a mnemonic device for remembering the colors of the rainbow. **In order for a mnemonic device to be useful, it needs to tether reminders to something very familiar**, so that the things you need to remember are all tied to something nearly impossible to forget.

One type of mnemonic device that helps you recall larger amounts of information is a memory palace. Memory palaces capitalize on the idea that it’s easier to remember images than words.

To create a memory palace, follow these steps:

1. Choose a physical space or route that you’re very familiar with, such as your home or your commute to work.
2. Choose objects or features that stand out in that physical space, such as your couch or a major intersection.
3. Make a mental link between each object and something you want to remember. For example, imagine yourself sitting on your couch with a friend who you need to remember to call.

When you need to recall the information, take a mental tour of the space. As you imagine yourself passing by each object, its associated reminder should pop up in your mind.

Another type of mnemonic device is a rhyme scheme, in which you create rhymes that associate your reminders with concrete images.

An example of a rhyme scheme is the peg method, which is a memory aid for lists of items. The peg method assigns an image to each number, from 1 to 20; the images always remain the same, no matter what you need to remember. Then you associate a reminder with each image. Say you assign “shoe” to 2, and you associate shoe with a reminder to go for a run.
