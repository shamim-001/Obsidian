## Feedback 3: Point Out Your Own Mistakes

### Principles

- Giving one-sided feedback gives the impression of an overbearing, perfect overlord chastising a flawed underling. It diminishes the person’s importance.
- **Admitting your own mistakes shows that you recognize the task is difficult and the person’s mistakes are understandable**. It encourages the person to rise to your level, and it lowers your own importance to match that of your partner.
- Adopt the genuine attitude that you are doing better primarily because you have considerably more experience, leading to high personal standards that are currently above others’ capabilities.
    - This includes your relationship with entry-level employees and children. How can you expect a 10-year-old to make the same decisions you do at age 40? Did you do the same when you were 10?

### Tactics

- Talk about similar mistakes you made earlier in your career, or when you were in the person’s situation.
- “You’ve made a mistake, but it’s no worse than many I’ve made.”
- To children: “You weren’t born with judgment. That comes only with experience, and you’re better than I was at your age.”

### Examples

- A secretary was making regular spelling mistakes. The engineer she was working for had made a list of words he had trouble spelling. He went to her and said, “this word doesn’t look quite right. I always have trouble with this word. That’s why I keep this list of words I misspell frequently. (flips to page) Yes, here it is. I’m careful with my spelling because people judge us by our letters.”
- A father wanted his son to stop smoking, despite being a smoker himself. He explained how he started smoking at his son’s age, how nicotine had gotten the best of him, and it was now impossible for him to stop. His cough was irritating and his health had deteriorated.
