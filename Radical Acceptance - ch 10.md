## Chapter 10: Seeing the Goodness in Everyone

The final three chapters of _Radical Acceptance_ shift the focus away from ourselves. Instead, we start discussing how to practice Radical Acceptance of others. **We begin the shift in this chapter, by revisiting the idea of the essential goodness that exists in all of us.** We begin by acknowledging that there will be times when we have trouble recognizing the goodness in ourselves and in others.

Therefore, this chapter discusses various ways to see people (including ourselves) differently. It goes over several practices we can use to see past the negative emotions and stories we’ve built up about ourselves and those around us, and to rediscover the Buddha nature in everyone.

### Recognizing Essential Goodness

When we feel betrayed (like by a cheating spouse, for example) we often lash out in anger. We attack the one who hurt us, and initially put the blame on him or her. However, many of our negative experiences also put us into the trance of unworthiness—we come to think that we’re having problems because there’s something wrong with us. Our outward resentment of that other person then reflects our inner resentment of ourselves—the betrayal confirms our feelings that we’re unworthy of love.

_Resentment_ means “feeling again.” Each time we retell ourselves the story of how we were betrayed, we feel the anger of being betrayed all over again. In other words, we repeatedly hurt ourselves by reliving the hurtful experiences.

However, the basic goodness of our being—our Buddha nature—can’t be changed no matter how lost we are in our delusions and narratives. There’s an important difference between doing bad things and being a bad person; that distinction applies both to ourselves and to the people who hurt us.

Recognizing the difference between _doing bad things_ and _being a bad person_—and therefore seeing the essential good in everyone—is a difficult task. It requires looking past harmful behaviors to see each person’s vulnerability and pain and the Buddha nature beneath all of that. It requires Radical Acceptance.

**The first step is to recognize the goodness in ourselves.** This often begins with forgiving ourselves for how we feel and what we might have done wrong. Forgiveness breaks down the barriers of blame and resentment that we build while trying to protect ourselves from pain. Those barriers are what keep us from experiencing the goodness and love that exists in ourselves and others. Therefore, by giving up on blame and opening our hearts to pain, we can begin to practice Radical Acceptance.

However, there may be times when our guilt and shame are so strong that we can’t forgive ourselves. This is especially the case when we believe that we’ve truly, deeply hurt somebody else. Perhaps we don’t think we deserve forgiveness, or we can’t see the point in it since the damage is already done.

**In cases like that, instead of forgiving ourselves, we can try forgiving the shame itself.** Rather than fighting the feeling, we can forgive it for existing and welcome it in, like the Buddha welcoming Mara in for tea. In doing so, we will allow the feeling to pass through us and fade away.

We might then find other feelings buried under the shame, such as fear or anger. We can meet those experiences in the same way: We can welcome them in, sit with them, and forgive them for existing.

This practice is effective because we’re giving our experiences permission to be what they are. Instead of trying to control our grief, pain, or shame, we simply allow it to exist—to be as big and powerful as it needs to be.

Learning to forgive ourselves and see our own goodness takes time and practice. **As with everything else we’ve discussed, the process starts with mindfulness**—we recognize that we’re being judgmental or unkind to ourselves, and we forgive whatever we’re feeling.

#### Forgiving Isn’t Condoning

Many people misunderstand this practice at first. They tend to think that accepting and forgiving hurtful behaviors is about letting people (themselves or others) off the hook for the pain they caused. **However, forgiving a behavior or a feeling isn’t the same as condoning it—Radical Acceptance isn’t permission to keep doing harmful things.** It’s facing past actions with understanding and compassion so that we can have a clear vision of the present and future.

For example, there are stories of death row inmates who faced up honestly to the harm they’d caused and learned to forgive themselves. By opening up to pain—their own and others’—they awakened compassion within themselves. By doing this, they were able to both take responsibility for the crimes they’d committed and recognize their own innate goodness.

Prisoners who accomplished this were visibly transformed. Guards, relatives, chaplains, and even other inmates all recognized that something had changed—that even though these people were in prison awaiting execution, they’d found a kind of inner freedom.

The main point is this: Holding on to blame and guilt might temporarily stop us from causing more harm, but in the long run it only creates more pain for ourselves and others. **We can’t hate ourselves into being good people;** only with forgiveness and Radical Acceptance can we find the wisdom and compassion to correctly respond to our situations.

### Seeing Ourselves Differently

When we’re lost in trances of unworthiness, guilt, or shame, there are several powerful practices we can use to look at ourselves differently and start to escape those feelings.

Think back to the practice of role reversal that we discussed in the previous chapter. Aside from encouraging compassion for other people, role reversal can also help us learn to love ourselves again.

Those around us often see positive qualities that we’re too lost in our own trances to see. For example, someone who likes to ask questions might think that he’s annoying, but his friends might love him for his wonder and enthusiasm. Seeing ourselves through someone else’s eyes can help to remind us of our best qualities, and the things that others admire about us. Practicing role reversal with a loved one is a great way to do this.

We can also try to escape our trances by thinking about ourselves differently. By reminding ourselves of things that we admire about ourselves, we can reawaken love and compassion. For example, an animal lover might think about the time she took in a stray dog, and how much joy she was able to bring to that creature’s life. Touchstones such as pictures or souvenirs can also be helpful reminders.

Finally, it can help to remember the love of a higher power. Again, this power could be God, Buddha, or something nonspecific like the universe. Brach illustrates this idea with a short anecdote.

A woman got addicted to heroin and wound up in the hospital, dying of AIDS. She was in despair because all she could think about was how she had destroyed her life and the lives of everyone around her, including her daughter.

A priest came to visit the woman on her deathbed, and he saw that she had a picture of her daughter on the dresser. He asked what would happen if the daughter made a mistake: Would the woman try to help her? Would she still love her? The dying woman answered that of course she would.

The priest’s parting words for the woman were that God had a picture of her on His dresser. That’s what forgiveness is: Not excusing the behavior, but loving the person regardless of it.

### Seeing Others Differently

**Other people have Buddha nature at the core of their beings, just like we do.** If we concentrate on seeing past everything extraneous like people’s appearance, actions, and our own labels for them, we start to see that we’re all essentially the same: beings made of love and awareness. There are various techniques that can help us see this basic goodness in others.

One practice is to imagine other people as children. No matter how frustrated parents may get with their children, many of them will feel simple, powerful love during quiet times—times when the child isn’t asking for yet another cookie or bothering the parent during an important meeting. As with children, we don’t necessarily dislike people just because we’re frustrated with their behavior.

Another method is to imagine that you’re meeting someone for the first time. Let go of your history with that person and your habitual labels for him or her. Simply encounter people as they are in that moment, not as you imagine them based on past interactions.

Finally, imagine that you’re seeing someone for the _last_ time. What do you admire about that person? What would you want to remember if you knew you’d never see him or her again?

Seeing the essential goodness in people naturally awakens what Buddhists call _metta_, translated as “lovingkindness.” Simply put, it’s a wish for someone’s health and happiness.

Like with compassion, there are practices to awaken this feeling of lovingkindness and expand it in ever-bigger circles. Traditionally we begin with ourselves—we reflect on our own goodness and offer wishes that we may be peaceful, happy, and filled with _metta_.

After that, we expand our circle of lovingkindness to include the people closest to us. It’s often easiest to begin with a single person, the one whose goodness is easiest for us to see. This could be a child, a parent, a grandparent, or a friend—there’s no “correct” person to choose.

Once we have someone in mind, we meditate on what we love about that person and offer him or her the same wish for happiness that we offered ourselves. Once that’s done. we can widen our circles of _metta_ to include other people that we’re close to, then people we don’t know as well, then those we don’t know at all.

**The most challenging part of this exercise is to experience lovingkindness for those who stir feelings of dislike or anger in us.** Offering those people wishes of peace and happiness is likely to feel forced and hollow at first.

However, if we welcome those negative feelings about other people and let them pass, we can continue offering well-wishes. In doing so, we’ll find (to our own surprise) that those wishes start feeling more sincere. **By offering care even when we don’t mean it, genuine caring feelings will start to awaken.**

This practice of universal lovingkindness is based on the understanding that every person’s deepest wish is simply to be loved. According to the Buddha, lovingkindness is the single most important spiritual practice. Wishing for universal peace and happiness helps us to reconnect with the essential goodness that exists in all people.
