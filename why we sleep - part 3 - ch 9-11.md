## Part 3: The Science of Dreams | Chapters 9-11: The Benefits of Dreaming

Dreaming is a bizarre experience. You’re unconscious, but you perceive intense vivid sensations and hallucinate things that aren’t there. You feel like you’re moving in the world, but your muscles are in a state of paralysis. You remember faces and memories that you haven’t thought about for years, maybe decades. You have no control over your emotions, swinging from intense rage and jealousy to exuberance. Finally, when you wake up, you promptly forget everything. **If you experienced all of this while awake, you’d think you were having a psychosis episode.**

It’s not surprising then that dreaming has had a complicated history. Walker explains that in the ancient past, Egyptians and Greeks wondered if dreams were divine gifts from gods.

Freud helped dispel this myth, firmly centering dreaming within the human brain. He considered dreams as expressions of repressed desires, and he built a psychological movement around interpreting dreams as such.

- The critical flaw in Freudian analysis was its unprovability—the interpretation methods were so subjective that different approaches yielded different results, and there was no strict hypothesis that was testable.
- Furthermore, the interpretations were horoscopically vague, thus seeming full of significance but not providing any practical insight (for example, “your dream is reminding you of how little time you have to do all the things you want to do.” Pretty much everyone feels this way.)

> **The Latest Dream Theories**
> 
> Since Freud’s time, there have been [several theories about the purpose of dreaming](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/14/weird-dreams-train-us-for-the-unexpected-says-new-theory), such as memory consolidation (dreams are replays of waking life), activation synthesis (dreams enable us to make connections between memories), and emotion regulation (dreams are a manifestation of, and some sort of therapy for, our emotions). Answering the question of why we dream isn’t straightforward because dreams may serve many purposes. [As one researcher puts it](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/why-do-we-dream-science-offers-a-few-possibilities), “Asking what dreams are for is like asking what waking thought is for.”
> 
> Two of the newer theories that emerged in 2021 are:
> 
> - **Network exploration to understand possibilities (NEXTUP).** In _[When Brains Dream](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324002833)_, sleep researchers Antonio Zadra and Robert Stickgold theorize that dreams, and not just the sleep state, are [important for memory consolidation](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2021/02/08/when-brains-dream/), allowing dreamers to create links between themes and memories and using narrative structures to help the brain figure out which of these associations may be useful.
>     
> - **Overfitted brain hypothesis.** Another theory suggests that [dreams in all their strangeness give the human brain a more well-rounded view of the world](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/14/weird-dreams-train-us-for-the-unexpected-says-new-theory). This was inspired by artificial intelligence, which tends to have a bias toward the data it’s trained on. The human brain is trained to process similar data every day.

### The Science of Dreaming

Most vivid dreaming happens during REM sleep (though NREM sleep has some vague non-vivid dreaming, like “I was thinking about clouds”).

During REM dreaming, Walker says that your visual, motor, memory, and emotional areas of the brain are active. Your prefrontal cortex (governing rationality) is muted.

He says it may even be possible to predict what you’re dreaming about through fMRI.

- To build a profile of your brain, you look at different images while awake, and the fMRI signature is captured.
- Then as you dream, your dreaming fMRI is matched to your awake fMRI profiles, predicting what you’re currently looking at while dreaming.

We often think about the meanings of our dreams. Do dreams merely replay events of the day, or do they reflect our emotional concerns?

- A study showed that only a small fraction (1-2%) of dreams replay the literal events of the day.
- A greater fraction (~45%) reflect our underlying emotional worries we have while awake.

> **The Ethics of Dream Research**
> 
> Advances in dream research have now made it possible to predict and, perhaps, eventually control dreams. While the pursuit of new knowledge is important, developments in the field of dream research do raise some questions and concerns:
> 
> - **[The importance of informed consent](http://www.theneuroethicsblog.com/2018/12/the-ethics-of-dream-recording.html)**—a study participant may be able to give her consent while fully conscious, but won’t have any control over what researchers could access in her brain while she’s asleep. Participants could unwittingly reveal highly personal and sensitive information that they would not have revealed while awake.
>     
> - **[The ethics of dream manipulation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dreaming-in-the-digital-age/202102/what-are-the-ethics-dreaming)**—dreams operate outside the realm of normal ethics, but what happens when subjects are manipulated into dreaming something they don’t want to dream about? We could argue that tricking someone into doing something in waking life is unethical, but tricking someone into doing something in their dreams—which theoretically has no impact on real life—lies outside any ethical or moral boundaries.
>

> It’s thus critical for scientists to establish policies to protect study participants, ensuring that they’re fully informed about experiments and the subsequent use of their data.

### Benefits of Dreaming and REM Sleep

Dreaming and REM sleep have three major mental benefits: blunting emotional pain, increasing understanding of others’ emotions, and increasing creativity.

#### Benefit #1: REM Dreaming Blunts Emotional Pain From Memories

During REM dreaming, the brain seems to reprocess upsetting memories and emotional themes, **retaining the useful lessons while blunting the visceral emotional pain**. This might be why we can look back at painful memories without feeling the original full emotional intensity.

How might this happen? Walker explains that REM sleep is the only time that the stress hormone norepinephrine is absent from your brain, which possibly allows the brain to process upsetting memories in a “safe” environment.

He provides suggestive evidence:

- PTSD patients have elevated norepinephrine in REM sleep. They also have recurring nightmares where the pain of the memory does not fade, either dreaming or waking. In a subset of patients, reducing norepinephrine levels through a drug reduces PTSD severity.
- In an experiment, subjects were shown a series of emotionally triggering images two times, separated by ~12 hours. One group saw Set 1 before sleeping and Set 2 after sleeping. The other group saw both on the same day without sleeping, Set 1 in the morning and Set 2 at night. The former group reported much less emotional disturbance upon seeing the images the second time, suggesting sleep had blunted their emotional reaction.

Interestingly, _dreaming_ about the upsetting content itself, or its emotional themes, is necessary to have this emotional blunting effect. REM sleep by itself does not.

(Shortform note: While Walker suggests that the dream state is responsible for processing emotional memories, neuroscientist Rebecca Spencer posits that [NREM sleep also plays a role](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181009-how-sleep-helps-with-emotional-recovery-and-trauma). She doesn’t explain the mechanism behind NREM sleep and its effect on emotions, but says that long naps—which mostly consist of dreamless NREM sleep—have been shown to decrease sensitivity to emotional stimuli in a subsequent waking state. However, she notes that the association between naps and emotional processing seems to be stronger in children than in adults. This may be because adults have a more mature hippocampus, which makes them hold onto memories longer, so a nap doesn’t give them adequate time to process emotional memories.)

#### Benefit #2: REM Sleep Increases Understanding of Other People’s Emotions

Sleep deprivation reduces your ability to interpret subtle facial expressions. **Sleep-deprived people more often interpret faces as hostile and aggressive.**

(Shortform note: This works both ways: While sleep-deprived individuals view other people more negatively, other people also view sleep-deprived people as more unpleasant. Research from Walker’s team, published in 2018, found that [sleep loss can be socially isolating](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/poor-sleep-can-literally-kill-your-social-life#:~:text=Poor%20sleep%20triggers%20viral%20loneliness,as%20people%20with%20social%20anxiety.), making people feel lonelier and avoid close contact with other people, which in turn sends a signal to other people to stay away. The lead author of the study suggests that the (supposed) decrease in sleep duration in the past few decades is linked to an increase in loneliness.)

#### Benefit #3: REM Sleep Increases Creativity

**REM sleep creates novel associations between ideas, which Walker says increases creativity and problem-solving.**

Informally, imagine the brain asking: “How can I connect what I’ve recently learned with what I already know, thus discovering insightful revelations? What have I done in the past that might be useful in solving this new problem?”

(Shortform note: Creativity is often associated with the arts, but there is [plenty of room for creative imagination in science](https://web.mit.edu/redingtn/www/netadv/SP20151130.html). For example, Walker cites Mendeleev, a chemist who developed the breakthrough periodic table of elements after happening upon the solution in a dream. A similar example is German chemist August Kekule—a popular anecdote credits his discovery of the structure of the benzene molecule to [a dream about a snake biting its own tail](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/16/science/the-benzene-ring-dream-analysis.html).)

Walker describes three positive effects of REM sleep on creativity:

**1) REM sleep increases the ability to solve creative problems.** In an experiment, subjects who were asleep were woken up to solve anagrams (for example OEOSG = GOOSE). Those who were awakened from REM sleep solved 15-25% more puzzles and had faster response times than those who had woken up from NREM sleep or who solved problems while awake during the day.

Walker notes that it’s not just REM sleep itself but also the _content_ that matters when it comes to problem-solving. In an experiment, subjects were given a maze to solve and given a chance to nap. People whose dreams were related to mazes were 10 times better at solving the maze upon waking versus people who didn’t dream about mazes.

(Shortform note: It may be possible to [manipulate your brain to solve problems during sleep](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619873344?journalCode=pssa). In a study, participants were given puzzles to solve, each one associated with a different sound. While the participants slept overnight, the sounds associated with half of the unsolved puzzles were played. The next morning, participants showed a 55% improvement in solving the puzzles with sound cues, suggesting that the sounds had redirected their brains toward problem solving during sleep.)

**2) REM sleep creates novel connections between distantly related concepts.** Walker describes an experiment in which study participants were taught a long chain of ideas, such as A>B>C>D>E and so on. Those who slept and got REM-rich sleep—whether it was from one night’s sleep that included late-morning REM sleep or a 60- to 90-minute nap that included REM sleep—were more able to make distant connections, such as B>E.

In the same way, REM sleep lets your brain connect new experiences to old ones. If you have to solve a problem today, you might think back to a similar problem you solved five years ago.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that this memory-processing function of dreams [enables you to use past experiences to prepare you for upcoming events](https://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20210616/how-dreams-might-prepare-you-for-whats-next). In a study, participants noted that half their dreams were related to past experiences, a quarter of their dreams were related to specific future events, and 40% of dreams contained elements of both past and future events. This suggests that you may be able to prepare yourself for a future event, like a presentation or a sports tournament, by thinking of related memories before you sleep.)

**3) REM sleep finds the patterns among the noise.** Even one night of sleep that includes REM sleep creates a higher-level comprehension of ideas, as demonstrated by toddlers who are better able to absorb new languages after getting some sleep. Walker also cites a study in which study participants were better able to find shortcuts for solving repetitive math problems after obtaining REM-rich sleep.

(Shortform note: Though Walker only lists the benefits of REM sleep for creativity, research published in 2018 shows that _[both NREM and REM sleep may play a role in creativity](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613%2818%2930070-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661318300706%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)_. The researchers suggest that the interplay between NREM sleep, which distills information from memories, and REM sleep, which works on forming new connections, facilitates creativity.)

### Lucid Dreaming

Lucid dreamers are able to voluntarily control their actions within their dream.

Walker says that researchers can verify when someone is lucid dreaming by pre-arranging eye movements and hand signals while the subject is awake, then detecting the subject making those same eye movements and hand signals while sleeping (the hand signals are detected by fMRI—remember, you can’t move during REM sleep because of muscle atonia).

He notes that less than 20% of people are capable of lucid dreaming, suggesting it might not be a hugely advantageous capability.

> **How to Start Lucid Dreaming, According to Science**
> 
> One study found that you can [increase your chances of having lucid dreams](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171019100812.htm) in just one week by combining these three techniques:
> 
> - **Reality testing**—constantly check your waking environment to see if you’re dreaming. This [develops your ability to determine your state of consciousness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020300222), which you can then carry over to your sleeping state.
>     
> - **Break up your sleep**—wake up after five hours, stay up for a short time, then go back to sleep. (While waking up after five hours may not seem ideal, the study participants didn’t report any negative effects on sleep quality.)
>     
> - **Mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD)**—upon waking up after five hours, tell yourself, “The next time I’m dreaming, I’ll remember that I’m dreaming.” This sends a signal to your brain, forming an intention that you then carry with you into sleep. In the study, those who fell back asleep within the first five minutes after practicing this technique showed a 47% increase in lucid dreaming.
