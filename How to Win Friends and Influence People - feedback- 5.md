## Feedback 5: Preserve the Person’s Pride

### Principles

- People crave importance. If you bulldoze this importance away, the person will resent you and become more difficult to influence later. Let them preserve their pride even when receiving feedback or being punished.

### Tactics

- (Shortform suggestions: The book doesn’t give clear directives on a general way of how to do this, but it centers around **preserving the person’s pride and what they care about**.
- Acknowledge that mistakes are done out of momentary carelessness or inexperience, and not lack of ability.
- If there is a misfit with a role, focus on the person’s other strengths and lift those up.
- Express confidence publicly in the person who made the mistake, to preserve the person’s social bonds (and avoid making her toxic for other people to be around). Avoid embarrassing her publicly.
- If letting people go, express that it was not due to the quality of their work, but the changing needs of the business. The business is rooting for them and believes in their potential.)

### Examples

- When a key employee was demoted from department head, instead of returning his original title, they gave him a new title: “Consulting Engineer.”
- An employee made a mistake on a project that required redoing it. She apologized to her manager for the error and said she would have the report before the next meeting. She expected the manager to explode in anger.
    - Instead of criticizing her carelessness, the manager thanked her for her work; said it wasn’t an unusual error for a new project; expressed his faith in her and knew she had done her best; it was lack of experience and not ability that made up for the failure.
    - Because of this human treatment, the employee resolved to never let him down again.
