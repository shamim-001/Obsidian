## Night

In 2006, Phil steps down as Nike CEO. Sales are $16 billion that year (to Adidas’s $10 billion). Nike has 5,000 stores and 10,000 employees worldwide. China is its largest producer of shoes.

Their world headquarters in Beaverton houses 5,000 employees in buildings named after people who helped create the company above a brand – Tiger Woods, Mia Hamm, Steve Prefontaine. The two main streets are named after Bowerman and Hayes. Phil is grateful, and he can’t help feeling the universe has been guiding him, nudging him through success.

The spirit of Nike seems to continue with their newest employees. They come in interested in company history and have an informal discussion group called the Spirit of 72.

Superstar athletes are grateful to Nike and to Phil too. Lebron James gives Phil a Rolex from 1972, engraved with “Thanks for taking a chance on me.” Michael Jordan reserves a front-row seat for Phil at his father’s funeral. Phil considers them family.

In 2000, Phil’s son Matthew dies in a diving accident. Phil and Penny are devastated. Every Nike athlete contacts them, but Tiger Woods is the first one, calling in at 7:30 AM. Phil will never forget this.

There are other losses along the way. Bowerman dies in 1999 in his hometown. Phil recalls crying so much that he gave up on tissues and just draped a towel over his shoulder.

Strasser (the lawyer who guided them through the Onitsuka trial and took on active roles in signing endorsements) dies in 1993. But before this, they have a falling out. Strasser was instrumental in signing Jordan and creating the Air Jordan brand. This success got to Strasser’s head, and he didn’t want to take orders from anyone. After clashes, he quit and went to Adidas, a betrayal that Phil never forgave. (They did, however, hire his daughter, Avery Strasser.)

Phil feels the same sense of betrayal when Nike comes under attack for the sweatshop controversy. Reporters never ask how much worse a factory was before Nike went in, made them better, safer, cleaner. They never see that Nike is just a renter of the factory, not the owner. And they ignore the immense job creation and helping poor countries modernize. Phil reacts angrily to this controversy, which doesn’t help the reaction.

But this spurs them to do better, and now they’re proud of their working conditions. They invent a water-based bonding agent that releases 97% fewer carcinogens in the air and released it for competitors to use. They try to push wages as high as they can, despite controls by foreign governments (one time, an official said it’d be disruptive for shoe workers to make more than doctors).

The other core members of the founding team are still around. Hayes lives on a farm in Tualatin Valley, with an array of bulldozers and construction equipment to play with. Woodell (the man in the wheelchair) becomes head of Port of Portland, a licensed pilot, and shareholder of a microbrewery. Johnson, employee #1, lives in New Hampshire, reading thousands of books he’s collected.

Phil watches the film _The Bucket List_ and muses on what he has left to do. He and Penny are giving away $100 million each year. They’ve created the new Matthew Knight basketball arena at U of Oregon, with Matt’s name in the center logo. He’s visited all the places he can think of.

Phil settles on wanting to tell the story of Nike. He wants to share the experience, all the ups and downs, so that young entrepreneurs can press on, comforted that even a great titan of a company as Nike started somewhere. He wants to tell people to think hard about how to spend their next forty years, to follow a calling and not to settle for a job.“If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt.”

So Phil starts writing.
