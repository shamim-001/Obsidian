## How to Build a Business

Many of the titans interviewed are entrepreneurs of some kind—often by building businesses, or by being self-employed as authors, entertainers, or media creators. These are the titans’ tips for how to start a successful business and grow it.

### 1,000 True Fans

To be successful, you don’t need to be a global superstar or have millions of followers.

Instead, **you need just 1,000 true fans** (a concept popularized by Wired founding executive editor Kevin Kelly). **A true fan is defined as “a fan who will buy anything you produce.”** True fans become your direct source of income and the major marketing force for ordinary fans.

If you can get true fans, then you’re sure that you’re solving problems for a real group of people. Produce work to excite your 1,000 true fans, not to get a lukewarm reception from 100,000 people.

- Author Kurt Vonnegut suggested that you should “write to please just one person”—yourself.
- Music producer Rick Rubin: The best art is polarizing. If half the people love it and half hate it, it’s pushing the boundary and not catering to the mainstream.
- Investor Eric Weinstein: Mainstream celebrity fame is overrated—it brings more liabilities than benefits. Instead, you want to be famous among an exclusive group of 2,000 people you handpick.

### Be Unquestionably Authentic

Many titans, especially those in entertainment, praised authenticity. **People crave realness and connection, and being yourself will find the audience that likes you for _you_.** Don’t be afraid to differ from common sense or society’s expectations to be yourself.

Quotes and stories on being authentic:

- Investor Chris Sacca: “Be your unapologetically weird self.” Sacca makes a note of only wearing cowboy shirts in public.
- Comedian Whitney Cummings found her greatest comedic success in revealing her embarrassing moments, which allowed her audience to connect and feel a catharsis.
- Actor Seth Rogen started his standup as a teenager trying to imitate other comics. Another comic told him he was the only one there who could talk about trying to get his first handjob, and he should talk about that.
- Cato, a Stoic senator in Ancient Rome, purposely wore darker robes than was customary and wore no tunic. As expected, he was ridiculed. He wanted to train himself to be ashamed only of things that are truly worth being ashamed of.
- Food critic and TV host Andrew Zimmern: In the pilot of his TV show, Zimmern could have made an easy joke of a Japanese restaurant’s name, which translated to “morning erections.” But he stayed true to himself and stayed respectful, which set the tone for his entire show. It’s a lot less work just being yourself.
- TV host Glenn Beck: Early in his radio show, a caller accused Glenn Beck of being Mr. Perfect. For 15 minutes, Beck shared his biggest mistakes and his past as an alcoholic. He first thought his career was over, but he then realized people are starving for something authentic.
- Chessplayer Josh Waitzkin: Being world-class requires embracing your eccentricity and building on it.
- Podcaster Dan Carlin (_Hardcore History_): Copyright your faults. When he started on radio, his producers complained that he was too loud and maxed out the recording meter; he retorted that this was his style.
- Film director Jon Favreau (_Iron Man_, _The Lion King_) advises that instead of trying to be funny directly, go for the truth, and you’ll find funny along the way.
- Braintree founder Bryan Johnson: He first sold credit card processing door-to-door with his honest pitch—“we’re the same as everyone else, except we’re honest, transparent, and care about customer service.” He was honest in an industry with shady practitioners.

### Small Details Can Make a Big Difference

Small actions can have a large impact, especially if you’re building a product or providing a service. People notice the details.

- Investor Chris Sacca wears only cowboy shirts in public, leading to a clear self-branding, unending media mentions and a recognizable style no one will imitate.
- Entrepreneur and author Derek Sivers: When he founded CD Baby in the 1990s, he had fun with the shipping email. Instead of simply giving a confirmation, it cooed about how “our world-renowned packing specialist lit a local artisan candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.” This little automated bit of joy could spread word of mouth.
- Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian did the same for error messages for his travel search company, Hipmunk. If you put in the same destination for From and To, it’ll say “That’s an awfully short trip.” Errors in setting dates show the error, “We don’t support trips to the past yet.” Trips that are too long warn, “Why don’t you just move there? 30 days is the max.”
- Chessplayer Josh Waitzkin thinks the little details add up to something big. If you’re not consistently maintaining quality, you’re encouraging sloppiness. There are hundreds of times more little moments than big moments, and they add up—do a good job in those little moments.

### Business Tactics

Here is a broad range of business tactics recommended by the titans.

#### Starting a Business

The Law of Category: With a new product, don’t ask yourself, “How is this new product better than the competition?” but rather, “**What new category is this product the first in?**” People are defensive about a new entrant encroaching on their favorite brands, but they’re more open with whole new categories.

- IBM was first in the computing category. DEC was first in the minicomputing category.

**Don’t think 10% bigger, think 10 times bigger.** When you go 10 times bigger, you have to start with a new approach. You’re by yourself in a new space, not competing with everyone else who’s also trying to get 10%.

Don’t head for a hyper-competitive area. Competition is hard and sucks the profit out of companies.

- Paypal co-founder and tech investor Peter Thiel has in the past been too focused on beating competitors, rather than on doing something that’s important. He also believes competition is a terrible thing for company health, preferring monopolies that can avoid competition. Ask yourself, “How can I be more successful by being less competitive?” (Shortform note: [Read more about his stance on competition in our summary of Thiel’s book Zero to One](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/zero-to-one).)
- Investor Eric Weinstein was previously a professor in academia, but switched to technology. He found that academia was a small, declining world where people were defensive and thus were on their worst behavior. In contrast, technology is a growing industry and much more open.

**You don’t need as much as you think. Use what you have.**

- Director Rob Rodriguez makes a list of assets he has and builds a film around the list, to keep his budget lean. His cousin had a ranch in Mexico, so that’s where he decided to shoot. His cousin also had a turtle, so that made it into the movie. His lack of resources also affected his style—because he didn’t record good audio, he cut rapidly when it got out of sync, which led to his trademark style.
- Alibaba founder Jack Ma: “There were three reasons why we survived: We had no money, we had no technology, and we had no plan. Every dollar, we used very carefully.”

**Create new ideas by connecting existing ideas that have never been connected before.** Something that is a commonplace solution in one area connected to another.

- Inventor Robert Plath reinvented luggage by putting two wheels and a telescoping handle on it.
- Table tennis player Hiroji Satoh was the first person to put a sponge on his racket.

#### Mindsets

**Failure is not good.** While this might sound obvious, accepting failure has become a common mindset in tech startups. (Shortform note: Aspects of these ideas were popularized by _[The Lean Startup](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-lean-startup)_.) In contrast, failure is actually painful and should be avoided.

- Founder and investor Marc Andreessen feels that pivoting from a company that isn’t working is too easy of an option and overvalued. Instead, put the time into figuring it out and getting it right.
- Peter Thiel also believes failure is overrated. While people think they can learn a lot from failure, Thiel believes that most businesses fail for a variety of reasons, and so you don’t learn anything at all. Failure of a business can be damaging and demoralizing.
- Jack Dorsey agrees that the worst advice given in his trade is “fail fast!”

**Understand fundamental principles, not just tactics.** Tactics become outdated. Learn the principles of business (like behavioral psychology) and you will create new tactics that adapt to the times.

**Take a short-term loss for a long-term advantage.** Be patient for the big reward.

- When making the film _Twins_, Arnold Schwarzenegger took zero salary in exchange for a percentage of the profits. It turned out to be his most profitable film ever.
- When making _Star Wars_, George Lucas negotiated for toy rights when the studio dismissed them as meaningless.
- Think of ways that you can bet on yourself while lowering risk for the other party. Can you work at a company you really like for free but with more equity?

#### Business Operations

**Charge for what you’re selling.** The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is to price your product low, or even free, to get mass penetration and volume. However, this causes problems with being unable to fund sales and marketing to rev up the growth engine. People paying for your product is proof that it’s good; if your product is free, you don’t know how much you can later charge for it.

- Photographer Chase Jarvis charged a high professional rate of $2,500 a day for his first day-rate gig. He had to deliver value equivalent to this, but by that point he had already trained his craft and was confident he could.
- Author Ramit Sethi gives away 98% of material for free, then charges very high prices for his flagship courses, which are 10 to 100 times more expensive than what competitors charge.
- For his podcast, Tim Ferriss didn’t take advertisers until he had over 100,000 downloads per episode. This let him avoid having to take small fish sponsors. He also sometimes runs high-priced events costing $10,000 per seat, with 200 seats.

Execute quickly. Peter Thiel asks, **“If you have a 10-year plan, why can’t you do this in 6 months?”**

Let your subordinates execute quickly and make decisions themselves.

- LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman empowered his employees to make judgment calls. He accepted an error rate of 10-20% if it meant people could move fast.
- When building his supplement company, Tim Ferriss was overloaded on customer support and a bottleneck for decision making. He gave his customer support team discretion for decisions with less than $100 at risk. Nothing exploded, and the business continued working fine, but he reduced his customer support time from 40 hours per week to 2. He says that people seem to get smarter once you give them responsibility and they feel you trust them.

Rule of 3 and 10: **Everything in the company breaks when you grow by 3 times and when you grow by 10 times.** Startups should expect to reinvent their company at these breakpoints.

- Army general Stanley McChrystal has a similar recommendation: at battalion level (600 people), commanders need to lead a different way, from managing everything themselves to developing managers who will take care of the details.
- Big companies have the opposite problem of startups, in that they plan for a tripling that may never happen, then get bogged down in all the extra processes.

**Recruit by starting with why.** Tell people what the purpose of what they’re doing is, before telling them what to do.

- Filmmaker Rob Rodriguez recruits actors for his low-budget films by telling them they’ll have an experience unlike any other. They’ll feel invigorated and have fun, and they’ll get great reviews.
- (Shortform note: [Read our summary of Simon Sinek’s Start With Why for more on this idea](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why).)

**The person who cares less, wins.** This is especially true in negotiation. Build yourself to a position where you can afford to care less.

- As a bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger really wanted to get into acting, but he avoided taking bit parts at first. Instead, he became independently wealthy through real estate, which then let him wait for the big film.

Here’s a smattering of marketing ideas:

- Send out email newsletters:
    - Author Ramit Sethi generates 99% of his revenue through email. They’re crafted to be simple 1-on-1 emails, even though behind the scenes there’s a lot of optimization.
- To find press contacts who covered products similar to yours, use Google Image reverse search of a picture of your product.
- To get warm introductions to press writers, use Facebook or Linkedin to find people connected to writers you want to reach.

### Investment Principles

Several titans who are investors in businesses share the principles that guide their decisions.

Tony Robbins has friends who work in hedge funds, who give this advice:

- Cap the downside. Be obsessed about not losing money and protecting against the downside.
- Find asymmetrical risk and reward—how do you get huge rewards with little risk?
- Asset allocation—diversify to reduce risk.

Tim Ferriss invests in companies himself:

- He invests in companies with these criteria:
    - They have technical founders.
    - It’s in a space that he can impact through his network.
    - They already have some traction so he doesn’t have to start the fire.
    - The founders aren’t entitled.
    - It’s not a crowded party round with a lot of participants but no lead.
- Breaking his rules to follow on a supposedly hot deal is a bad idea. Following his rules when others reject companies for other reasons has worked well for him.
- Beyond investing money, Ferriss also contributes advising time. This helps him get more equity without putting in more capital.
- Tim’s portfolio makes him feel like there’s no way he’ll lose money on that deal, which means they’re rarely low-probability moonshots.
- Venture capital doesn’t have hedges like investment funds do, but a decent approximation is big businesses like Uber, which are relatively diversified through their international exposure and can be considered counter-cyclical to the macro economy (since a stock market crash may lead people to buy fewer cars and take more rides).

Digg founder Kevin Rose, who was also an investor at Google Ventures, asks himself these questions:

- Do I understand it?
- Will it be dominant and growing 3 years from now?
- Will this technology be a greater or lesser part of our lives in 3 years?
- What impact do the features have on the emotions of its users?
    - For instance, when assessing Twitter, he realized its short character length lowered the friction for sharing. Gathering followers was a new activity that promoted competition and scoring.

Behance founder and investor Scott Belsky suggests learning from the past, without being beholden to it. What little details made it work? What conventional wisdom did they violate?
