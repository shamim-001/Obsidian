## Chapter 7: Principle 1—Accountability Breeds Success

Now that you know the five disciplines to reach your goals, let’s look at three principles to help you stay focused.

**You will experience more success and pride in your work if you hold yourself accountable for following your plan.** The nature of accountability is often misunderstood. You’ve heard managers say that they need to hold their employees accountable. You’ve heard lawyers say that criminals must be held accountable for their crimes. You’ve said that you're more productive when someone holds you accountable. These phrases convey accountability as some form of punishment or mandate applied to one person by another, but this is not accurate.

Accountability is a personal action. You hold yourself accountable when you make the choice to do what is needed. Accountability is the recognition of freedom of choice, not actions performed under duress. When you do something because you have to do it, the task feels like a burden, and you likely only put forth enough effort required to complete the task. But **when you do something because you _choose_ to do it, you're more empowered to perform the task to the best of your ability.**

To truly be accountable, you must release your beliefs that things in the external world have control over your life. You can’t wait for the market to improve before you decide to invest in your company. You can’t wait for the right job to improve your life. External factors can’t shape positive results in your life. You are the only person able to create the life you want through your actions, but you must be honest about who you are and how you act to begin the process.

Take ownership of your life to understand what is required of you to change it. Embrace accountability in choice to improve your production and personal interests. **When you realize your choices create your path to success, you’ll see greater possibilities for your future and gain the courage to try new things to bring them to fruition.**

### Creating More Accountability

You can only start being accountable for your life when you stop looking outside yourself for the answers. Society is full of examples of victimhood. We blame people, circumstances, our parents, the government, and corporate America for why we aren’t able to thrive in life. **When you blame others for your lack of success or make excuses about why you can’t do more with your life, you limit your potential to only what others allow you to achieve.**

Being accountable means understanding that you control your own fate. Life will happen to you whether you want it to or not. Tragedy strikes, you don’t get the results you want from your actions, people don’t respond the way you wanted, or you fail at something important. You can’t control these things, but you can control how you respond to them.

When you’re accountable, you stop looking for blame and start looking for solutions. Failures and barriers become challenges to surmount, not roadblocks that stop your progress. Take a moment to think about all the reasons why you haven’t reached your vision before. What did you allow to derail your beliefs or efforts? What external forces did you blame for your inability to succeed? You’ve given away your power to forces out of your control for too long. Make the decision today to start owning your choices so nothing will ever stop you from achieving your full potential again.

The following are four ways to encourage accountability in your life:

##### 1. Stop being a victim.

Pay attention to when the little voice in your head starts to whine. Listen for excuses, and notice when you’re settling for less than what you know you can accomplish. When you experience these sensations, turn your focus to what you can control right now, and move toward those factors ready to act.

##### 2. Don’t complain.

**When you start to complain about how unfair life is, you start to believe life is unfair.** Your despair can turn into depression, wherein you believe the world is against you. Keep your thoughts positive to breed a positive attitude.

##### 3. Change your behavior.

You can’t continue to do the same thing and expect to get different results. If you want a different life, you have to lead a different life. **Be willing to change your habits and behaviors so you can make the right choices that lead to new results.**

##### 4. Surround yourself with accountable people.

The people in your life influence you more than you think. If you consistently interact with negative people who blame the world for their problems, their attitude will infect you. Find people who own their destinies, and model this ownership to the victims in your life.

#### Organizational Accountability

You’ve already learned that accountability is not something to hold people to, but this is worth stating so you avoid the trap of using the term to represent failures with your workers. **When you use people’s shortcomings against them, they’re more likely to adopt a mindset of victimhood.** In addition, you leave them little room for them to own their processes of feedback and adjustments in actions.

You can have consequences for your employees if they’re dropping the ball, but you must give them space to learn from their mistakes if they’re going to take ownership and develop solutions. The following are some ways to support positive accountability in your organization:

- Be honest about the benefits of failure, such as feedback on areas of improvement, so your employees recognize what actions are needed. This will help them stop blaming you or others for their lack of success.
- Set an example of accountability in your work.
- Be clear with your staff about what you expect them to accomplish so they know what choices they need to make.
- Learn from your experiences. Allow your organization to take the losses you experience and use them to grow.
- Keep your eyes pointed forward. Belaboring past mistakes or failures is really your way of making excuses or looking for someone or something to blame. Let the past be the past, and lead your team forward to better choices.

#### Common Errors and Tips

Avoid these errors when approaching the concept of accountability:

- You continue to use accountability to represent consequences.
- You allow the external world to control your actions.

Remember these tips to stay accountable:

- Be completely honest about how your choices affect your life.
- Look inside to find the answers you need to act.
- Own your choices by focusing only on things you can control.
