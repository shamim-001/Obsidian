## Chapter 5: Value—Taking Responsibility

**When you don’t feel in control of a situation, you become unhappy.** However, according to Manson, it’s often a matter of perspective: A difficult problem can make you miserable, or it can give you a sense of accomplishment when you solve it.

Often, the only difference is in the degree to which you’re responsible for the situation or feel you have a choice in it. **We feel in control and empowered when we choose our problems or challenges**; when forced to deal with problems not of our making, we feel helpless and victimized.

But here’s Manson’s solution: No matter what situation you’re in, no matter your circumstances, you always have a choice. **You can choose what you think, and how you behave in every situation.** Once you accept your responsibility and ability to make choices, you’ll feel empowered in any situation, and this will make you happier.

Even in the worst situations—for example, being stuck in the hospital, or in prison—your attitude and your behavior are **your choice** and **your responsibility.**

> Discipline (or self-control) is one of the values that Robin Sharma teaches in _[The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-monk-who-sold-his-ferrari/chapter-10)_ He makes the case that chasing after your whims doesn’t make you powerful or free; on the contrary, it makes you a slave to your own desires. Therefore, he urges you to study your desires and only act on those that are worthwhile—namely, your desires to grow and improve yourself.
> 
> According to Sharma—and Manson—true freedom and power lie in having the discipline to make your own decisions, instead of being pushed along by outside forces like desire.

### You’re Always Making Choices

Manson says that, **while we don’t always control what happens to us, we're always responsible for how we respond to it.**

In any situation, you have more choices than you think:

- You choose the values and standards you live by.
- You choose how to interpret what happens and how to respond.

Manson also points out that you actually _can’t_ avoid responsibility—even choosing not to respond to something is a response, and you’re responsible for it. Therefore, the question isn’t whether or not you should decide to take responsibility; **the question is what values you’ll base your decisions on.**

In other words, what will you give a f*ck about?

> **The Benefits of Values-Based Decisions**
> 
> Knowing your values and sticking to them has many benefits. For example, Forbes interviewed 12 CEOs about how [values-based decisions have helped their companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/07/20/what-does-it-mean-to-make-values-based-decisions-12-entrepreneurs-weigh-in/?sh=2f8a19c1283f). Some of the responses included:
> 
> - **Clarity.** Clearly defined values help with decision-making, because any given decision becomes a simple question of whether it goes against one of those values.
>     
> - **Efficiency.** Clear values lead to clear goals. In turn, clear goals stop you from overextending yourself trying to chase every passing whim. You can use your resources (time, money, energy, and so on) _effectively_ and _efficiently_.
>     
> - **Transparency.** When people know what your values are, they’ll find you more trustworthy. Furthermore, they’ll find it easier to anticipate what you’d want in any given situation—therefore, you’ll find that people are more helpful and accommodating when your values are clear.
>     
> - **Being true to yourself.** Defining your values and living by them is the best way (perhaps the only way) to **become the person you want to be.**
>     
>     - Looking at it another way: You have to know what your goal is before you can reach it. Defining your values will allow you to set meaningful goals for yourself.

### Responsibility Versus Blame

Manson believes that the more responsibility we assume for what happens in our lives, the more power and control we have. Thus, taking responsibility is the first step toward solving our problems.

Furthermore, it’s a common misconception that taking responsibility for something means taking the blame for it, but responsibility and blame are different things. We aren’t to _blame_ for everything that happens to us (for instance, a traumatic childhood), but we’re still _responsible_ for how we respond to it.

(Shortform note: When approaching this concept, you might find it helpful to replace the word “blame” with “fault.” Your current situation (whatever it is) might not be your _fault_; however, dealing with it is still your _responsibility._)

Manson stresses that **you alone are responsible for your circumstances.** Others may have contributed to the situation, but you’re responsible for your unhappiness because you’re choosing how to react to and frame the situation.

For example, suppose somebody robs you in a bad part of town. The robber is responsible for that event, but not for how you feel about it. Only you can make yourself happy again; you can decide to **accept** what happened (a value) and **learn a lesson** (why did I get robbed? How can I avoid similar situations in the future?).

> **Attribution Error Mislabels Blame**
> 
> One way that people commonly avoid taking responsibility is through _[attribution error](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error)_ (also called _attribution bias_). Basically, people tend to attribute their own shortcomings to circumstance (losing a job because “the manager hates me,” for example), and other people’s shortcomings to character flaws like laziness or carelessness. In _[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living)_, Dale Carnegie suggests that you [treat others with the same tolerance you have for yourself](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/part-4)—assume that what they do is the result of circumstance, rather than poor character.
> 
> However, Manson takes this one step further by saying that you _shouldn’t_ assume your shortcomings are because of circumstance. Taking Manson and Carnegie’s ideas together, we’d end up with a sort of “reverse attribution bias,” wherein we assume that our own problems are due to our choices, while others’ are due to their circumstances. Interestingly, that closely resembles Marcus Aurelius’s insistence that we should be [strict with ourselves, but patient with others.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/books-4-6)

Manson offers another way to approach this concept: **Blame exists in the past, while responsibility exists in the present.** In other words, when you blame someone (including yourself), you’re focused on the past: ”How did this situation happen?” When you take responsibility, you’re focused on the present: What are you going to _do_ about it?

Furthermore, blame is destructive—it serves no purpose except to make someone feel bad. However, responsibility is constructive—it drives you to find and implement solutions.

> In _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/books-4-6)_, Marcus Aurelius offers two compelling arguments against the very concept of blame (or fault):
> 
> - **Blame is pointless.** People make mistakes and hurt others due to ignorance or accident, not out of malice. There’s no sense in blaming people (including yourself) for what they don’t know, or for an honest mistake. Instead, you should teach them (or learn) how to avoid that problem in the future.
>     
> - **Blame is useless.** Even if there were someone to blame for a situation, doing so wouldn’t fix the problem. The only rational approach is to find a solution and work to implement it.
>     

### Responding to Tragedy

It’s a fact of life that tragic and horrible things sometimes happen. You don’t choose what happens to you, but you do choose how you handle it.

For example, if you’re robbed, ﻿you didn’t choose it, but you made choices nonetheless. For instance, you made choices at the time (running, screaming, or fighting), and later you chose how to respond to the physical and emotional aftereffects.

Manson stresses that **we all experience pain of some kind—we decide what that pain means, and how to respond to it.**

> **A Buddhist Take on Suffering**
> 
> The central tenets of Buddhism—the [Four Noble Truths](https://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htm) and the [Eightfold Path](http://britannica.com/topic/Eightfold-Path)—teach us that suffering is a fact of life, as Manson says. Everyone will experience pain, fear, and tragedy at some point.
> 
> The Four Noble Truths are Buddhists’ philosophies on the existence of suffering, and the Eightfold Path is Buddhism’s solution to that suffering. Buddhism teaches that, by constantly striving to speak, act, and think in constructive ways, you can free yourself from pain. In other words, by **taking responsibility for your thoughts and actions, you can find peace.**
> 
> We can see a direct connection between these teachings and Manson’s theories, in that Manson also advises that you accept suffering and focus on how to respond to it rather than fight it or be upset by it.
> 
> **Four Noble Truths:**
> 
> - Suffering exists.
>     
> - People suffer due to worldly desires (for material goods, physical pleasure, and so on) and ignorance (failure to see the world as it is, which leads to such vices as anger, greed, and hate).
>     
> - Your suffering will end (this may refer either to finding peace in your lifetime, or achieving [Nirvana](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nirvana-religion) after you die).
>     
> - The Eightfold Path will free you from suffering.
>     
> 
> **Eightfold Path:**
> 
> - Correct understanding—seeing the world as it truly is
>     
> - Correct thought—rejecting thoughts of desire and animosity
>     
> - Correct speech—avoiding lies and hurtful words
>     
> - Correct action—ethical behavior
>     
> - Correct livelihood—avoiding occupations that cause harm directly (like fighting in wars) or indirectly (like selling alcohol or other drugs)
>     
> - Correct effort—working tirelessly toward enlightenment
>     
> - Correct mindfulness—awareness of yourself, your mental and physical state, and your surroundings
>     
> - Correct concentration—single-minded focus; meditation
>     

#### Playing the Hand We’re Dealt

Manson acknowledges that many people are born with disadvantages. Those people may feel as though they got the short end of the stick, and they’re helpless to do anything about their situation, so they avoid taking responsibility. However, even though it’s not their fault, they’re still responsible for their choices—and the outcomes of those choices.

Life is like poker: A player who gets a bad hand can still win. **The outcome of the game is determined by the players’ choices.**

(Shortform note: Ludwig von Beethoven famously composed great works of classical music [despite being deaf](https://www.californiasymphony.org/composer/beethoven/the-whole-story-of-beethovens-deafness/). His desire to create music (a value) was more important to him than his disability, so he didn’t slip into a victim mindset. This example shows that knowing your values and sticking to them can help you overcome seemingly impossible circumstances; **the only thing that can truly hold you back is yourself.**)

### Perpetual Victims

People often try to shift responsibility for solving their problems to others. Manson believes that blaming someone else creates a feeling of moral righteousness; a brief high that comes from feeling special.

Manson also believes that **social media helps enable this behavior by making it easy to shift responsibility to other people.** Users join in a public blame game, sharing injustices to generate sympathy and attention, which rewards those who feel victimized. Moral indignation makes them feel good and they get addicted to this feeling.

Here are some destructive effects:

- People on both the right and left, rich and poor, from every demographic group claim to be victims.
- People who are offended claim they’re being oppressed, and expect outrage and attention.
- **There’s a repeating cycle or spiral of outrage**: Media find something offensive, they broadcast it, this creates outrage, they broadcast the outrage to generate more outrage.
- The propensity of so many to declare themselves victims over small things distracts attention from real victims.
- It threatens democracy. Part of living in a democratic society is tolerating people and views you disagree with.

(Shortform note: Social media experts have noted that websites like Facebook and Twitter [encourage extreme beliefs and behavior](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/facebook-twitter-terrorism-extremism.html) almost by design. Since everyone can have a platform on those sites, only the loudest and most outrageous personalities rise to prominence. Furthermore, such sites naturally create “echo chambers,” where you only have to interact with people who share your opinions. Taken together, these phenomena reinforce one another and lead to ever-more-extreme beliefs.)

We’ve all seen this counterproductive phenomenon. Instead of participating, Manson suggests that you:

- Maintain a healthy skepticism toward the media and avoid categorizing others.
- Practice healthy values of honesty, doubt/uncertainty, and open-mindedness over destructive values of being right or morally superior.
- Nurture democratic values to support our political system.

Instead of playing the victim and expecting special treatment when you encounter disagreement, take responsibility for your feelings and choices.

> **How to Effectively Disagree**
> 
> Manson gives general guidelines for avoiding the destructive aspects of social media but doesn’t offer any concrete, actionable advice. This [TED Talk](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/m18TCiU9) by Julia Dhar explains **how you can disagree in a productive way, rather than a hateful and destructive way.**
> 
> In summary, the steps are:
> 
> - **Fault the idea, not the person.** If you encounter an idea or opinion that you believe is wrong, explain why you think that. Don’t resort to personal attacks; just because someone has a bad idea, that doesn’t mean that he or she is a bad person.
>     
> - **Find common ground.** This is hardly new or uncommon advice, but Dhar emphasizes that even the _smallest_ bit of common ground will do as a starting point.
>     
>     - For example, if one person wants much stricter immigration laws while another wants much looser laws, **they both agree that the current system isn’t working.** That’s enough to start a productive conversation.
> - **Practice humility.** Set aside your need to be right, along with your certainty that you _are_ right; in other words, set aside your pride.
>     
>     - A useful thought exercise is to imagine that you’re on the other side of the issue. What would it be like if you fully embraced the opposing viewpoint? How would you defend it? Debate teams often do this exact exercise to make sure that they fully understand _both_ sides of a topic, not only their own side.
> - **Accept the possibility that you’re wrong.** Before you debate a topic, you should be able to explain what it would take to change your mind about it.
>     
>     - If nothing can change your mind, then you’re not debating; you’re just fighting.
