## Chapter 1: Striving Won’t Make You Happy

Manson argues that social media, entertainment, and advertising urge us to give a f*ck about everything incessantly. **We “must” always strive for more**—more happiness, more money and success, more experiences, more friends, more possessions, greater attractiveness, and a better body. In addition, self-help “experts” unrealistically urge us to be positive and happy all the time.

But, Manson says, we feel unhappy instead because **these messages emphasize what we lack**. By constantly wishing/striving for something, we reinforce to ourselves that we don't have it. Then the self-help experts give us superficial, short-term fixes: Stand in front of a mirror and repeat affirmations, or follow 10 easy steps to become rich. The advice further emphasizes what we’re lacking while failing to offer lasting solutions.

(Shortform note: There is genuine science behind self-help techniques such as [affirmations](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/); for instance, they help us to boost our sense of self-worth and decrease stress. However, Manson is correct that such techniques mostly help you to become more comfortable with who you already are—they won’t help you to change your **core values**, which is what _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ is all about.)

Manson contends that as a result:

- **We become addicted to the unreal and fake**, and constantly pursue superficial things because we believe more is better. While this is good for business, it’s not good for our well-being.
- We get addicted to temporary highs.
- We become frustrated when we fall short of society’s expectations, and overwhelmed with all we are urged to be and do.
- We feel entitled to always feel good, and we go out of our way to avoid dealing with pain, failure, and challenges.

> **The Philosophical Origins of _The Subtle Art_**
> 
> The advice in _Subtle Art_ comes largely from three philosophical traditions (Stoicism, Existentialism, and Buddhism). In brief.
> 
> **Stoicism** values reason and duty above all else.
> 
> - In _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations/1-page-summary)_ (one of the definitive Stoic texts) Marcus Aurelius says that **the only meaningful use of your time is to find out what you’re meant to do in the world, and then do it.**
>     
> - Aurelius also says that how you feel—and how others feel about you—doesn’t matter; every action you take should be driven by rational thought and devotion to your purpose.
>     
> 
> **Existentialism** values [personal choice and personal growth.](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/an-introduction-to-existentialism/)
> 
> - It’s rooted in the idea that **life is meaningless, and therefore you must make your own meaning.**
>     
> - An existentialist should determine what values and beliefs he or she holds, and then devoutly follow them. However, it’s crucial that those beliefs and values are personal, and not instilled by someone else.
>     
> 
> **Buddhism** values [acceptance and tranquility](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapters-4-5).
> 
> - These values are exemplified in stories of how the Buddha dealt with the evil god Mara: Rather than fighting against him, the Buddha would greet Mara as a friend and invite him in for tea.
>     
> - Following the Buddha’s example, a Buddhist tries to meet any experience—positive or negative—with calm acceptance.

### Choose Your F*cks Carefully

Manson says that we go through life giving too many f*cks. **We need to choose constructive values and standards**, use them to decide what things we care most about, **and reject the rest.**

Furthermore, we give f*cks about all the wrong things. Even if you happen to achieve success as defined by society (wealth, fame, and so on), that doesn’t necessarily lead to a more satisfying life. Satisfaction comes from a life built on constructive values and choices.

Manson’s point here is illustrated by the many people who’ve very publicly achieved material success but were still unhappy. Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and guitarist of Nirvana, provides a poignant example of how “success” as defined by society doesn’t always lead to a happy life. Despite his commercial success as a musician—Nirvana is [one of the best-selling bands in history](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-25413509)—he struggled with mental health issues and addiction. Cobain eventually [took his own life](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kurt-cobain-commits-suicide) at the age of 27.

Manson contends that despite what self-help experts say, **feeling good all the time is impossible**. You can’t attain satisfaction without experiencing pain, struggle, and failure. Anything worthwhile has a negative side (for instance, being physically fit requires painful exercise). If you try to avoid the negative you don’t get to experience the worthwhile thing.

Therefore, the key to a happy, meaningful life is to **give a f*ck about less,** and **focus on what is most valuable and important** to you.

> We can mesh Manson’s advice to give fewer f_cks with a common rule of thumb, the _80/20 Rule_ (also known as the [Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp)), which states that 80% of your results come from 20% of what you do. Thus, the trick is to figure out **what 20% of your thoughts, actions, or values produce 80% of the outcomes in your life, and focus your energy (your f_cks) on those.**
> 
> In _[Factfulness](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/factfulness/5)_, Hans Rosling elaborates that the 80/20 Rule applies to everything from causes of death to items in a budget—20% of the items in each dataset cause 80% of the results in that dataset. One scientific study even suggests that the 80/20 Rule might be a result of the [natural law of entropy](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb12/arbeitsgruppen/datenbionik/pdf/pubs/2002/ultsch02proof).

### Trapped in a Feedback Loop

Unlike animals, Manson notes, we have the unique ability to think and examine our thoughts. This ability, combined with our fixation on being happy all the time, can create an unproductive feedback loop in which our feelings spiral out of control whenever we begin to feel bad about something.

**We feel bad about feeling bad because of our culturally driven belief that we _shouldn’t_ feel bad**—that guilt, anxiety, fear, and other negative feelings are not OK.

According to Manson, the key to breaking the emotional feedback loop is to not take your feelings so seriously—to not give a f*ck. Tell yourself: **Things are screwed up and I feel bad, but that’s okay.** This frees you to stop berating yourself because you feel bad.

> In _[Radical Acceptance](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-8-9)_, psychologist Tara Brach calls this feedback loop the Trance of Unworthiness. She says that we can break out of that trance by **accepting ourselves for however we are at the present moment.**
> 
> Accepting ourselves—and thereby waking from the trance—requires _recognition_ and _compassion_, which is summed up quite nicely in the sentence **“Things are screwed up and I feel bad, but that’s okay.”**
> 
> - **Things are screwed up and I feel bad…:** this is _recognition_ of your current situation.
>     
> - **...but that’s okay:** this is _compassion_ for yourself and your experiences.
>     
> 
> In other words, the key is to _accept_ yourself and your bad feelings, instead of berating yourself for feeling bad or immediately trying to feel better.

### What Does Not Giving a F*ck Mean?

Manson clarifies that **“not giving a f*ck” _doesn’t_ mean being apathetic, or not caring about anything.**

Instead, not giving a f*ck means:

- **Being comfortable with your own set of values** instead of following society’s dictates. When you know what’s important, you shrug off challenges and do what you feel is right regardless of what anyone might say.

(Shortform note: A recurring theme in _[Meditations](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/meditations)_ (the Stoic book written by Marcus Aurelius) is that others’ thoughts are neither your responsibility nor your problem. In short, the Stoics would agree with Manson: Do what you know is right, and don’t give a f*ck what anyone else thinks about it. Follow your own values, not someone else’s.)

- **Realizing that simplifying your priorities, rather than pursuing everything, actually makes you happier**. As you focus on the more important parts of your life—family, a fulfilling job, friends, a committed relationship—this approach turns out to be satisfying.

(Shortform note: Robin Sharma’s _[The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-monk-who-sold-his-ferrari)_ is a parable that teaches this lesson. In it, a wealthy lawyer gives up his materialistic, workaholic life and becomes a monk. His new lifestyle is devoted to simple pleasures and self-improvement. After making this change, and simplifying his priorities just like Manson advises us to do, he becomes much happier and healthier than he’d been as a lawyer.)

- **Even for important goals, taking it easy**. Stop struggling so much for things. When you care less about something, you may actually do better at it. When you stop obsessing, the pressure is off and things often work out. Often the person who is least interested in a result ends up attaining it.

> You can take it easy without being disinterested. There are ways that you can generate **positive pressure** that inspires you to do better work. Such helpful pressure is called _eustress_—as opposed to _distress_, which is negative pressure that distracts and upsets you. As long as you avoid distress, you’ll feel like you’re “taking it easy.”
> 
> Tony Robbins (_[Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-9)_) suggests a few ways that you can create eustress, and avoid turning it into distress:
> 
> - **Announce your goal to your friends.** If you know that people are watching and rooting for you, you’ll be inspired to work toward your goal.
>     
> - **Focus on your goal.** Keeping your goal in mind at all times will prompt your brain to keep seeking ways to achieve it, even subconsciously. This subconscious problem-solving is why you sometimes get a flash of inspiration while doing something unrelated to that problem.
>     
> - **Don’t call it “failure” if you don’t reach your goal.** While it’s disappointing to fall short of your goal, you will have learned and grown from pursuing it, and you may be able to achieve something even greater than that goal in the future.

### What’s the Point of This Book?

Manson sums up Chapter 1 with a reflection of how this book will help you:

- Clarify what you are choosing as important and unimportant in your life.
- Realize that not giving a f*ck changes your direction in life as you choose what’s important and what’s not.
- Understand that it's OK to feel bad, or for things to go badly in life.
- Accept that pain is an inevitable part of life, and you can use it as a tool or catalyst for improvement.
- Be more comfortable with pain, take problems less seriously, and face your fears.
- Learn how to give fewer f*cks, by no longer striving for superficial things.
