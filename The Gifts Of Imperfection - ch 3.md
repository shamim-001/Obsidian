## Chapter 3: Combating Shame to Fuel Worthiness

We’ve explored the factors that help to _cultivate_ worthiness. Now, we’ll consider the main _barrier_ to developing self-worth: shame.

Shame is the focus of much of Brené Brown’s work, from her research, to her books, to her speeches. **Based on her research, Brown defines shame as feeling that you don’t deserve to be loved because you’ll never be “good enough.”** Brown reminds us that everyone experiences shame at some point; it’s an innate part of being human.

> **What _Is_ Shame?**
> 
> Brown’s definition of shame is intrinsically linked to the idea of worthiness. **She presents shame predominantly as a “foil” to worthiness**—the thing that stops worthiness from developing—as we’ll explore in the next section.
> 
> Generally, psychologists have accepted and supported Brown’s ideas on shame. [Her seminal paper on shame](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259982000_Shame_Resilience_Theory_A_Grounded_Theory_Study_on_Women_and_Shame) has been cited more than 150 times, predominantly to agree with and build on her ideas. Furthermore, other authors have put forward definitions of shame that, similar to Brown’s, center on self-worth. For instance, in _[Get Out of Your Head](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/get-out-of-your-head)_, Jennie Allen asserts that [shame is rooted in the fear that other people will reject your true self](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/get-out-of-your-head/chapter-9). This fear is intrinsically linked to the idea that your “true self” _isn’t good enough_ for those people.
> 
> However, some commentators have developed different definitions of shame from Brown’s. For example, [Joseph Burgo](http://www.josephburgo.com/), a practicing psychotherapist and author, argues that there are [four different types of shame](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/different-types-shame-psychology-a8287981.html): shame due to failure, exclusion, unrequited love, and humiliation. Likewise, in _[So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed)_, author Jon Ronson cites psychologists who describe [shame more as a numb absence of feeling, rather than a feeling](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed/part-1) as Brown suggests. Clearly, when it comes to defining shame, there isn’t a consensus view.

### Shame and Worthiness

So exactly _how_ is shame a barrier to worthiness? According to Brown, shame prevents worthiness from developing because **it’s completely antithetical to everything worthiness represents.** It’s built on foundations of fear, self-hatred, and the sense that you’re not “enough.” Worthiness simply can’t flourish if you think this way.

Brown also posits that shame encourages you to reject and hide parts of yourself that you think others will judge or dislike—for example, your flaws and your failures. Ultimately, **worthiness can’t grow if you feel ashamed of who you are.**

> **The Other Effects of Shame**
> 
> In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown predominantly highlights the negative effects of shame on _self-worth_. It’s worth noting that shame can affect us in many other ways than just inhibiting worthiness:
> 
> - In his book _[Healing the Shame That Binds You](https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Healing-the-Shame-That-Binds-You/John-Bradshaw/9780757303234)_, the late author and speaker [John Bradshaw](https://www.johnbradshaw.com/books/healing-the-shame-that-binds-you) linked shame to the development of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. He also argued that shame informs numerous toxic behaviors, including addiction, forming unhealthy relationships, and dishonesty.
>     
> - In _[Get Out of Your Head](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/get-out-of-your-head)_, Jennie Allen argues that [shame causes us to self-sabotage relationships, push people away, and refuse help when we’re struggling](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/get-out-of-your-head/chapter-9). This makes us isolated and lonely, which fuels low-self worth.
>     
> - In _[Radical Acceptance](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance)_, Tara Brach notes that [feeling ashamed of a specific instance of bad behavior can prevent us from forgiving ourselves for the mistake](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/radical-acceptance/chapter-10) and moving on.

### How to Overcome Shame

Now that we know how harmful shame is, what can we do to try to overcome it? Brown argues that the best way to overcome shame is to **develop shame resilience.** She conceives shame resilience as **being able to identify shame as it occurs and move past it in a healthy way that protects your worthiness.**

But how can we _develop_ shame resilience? Brown is clear about the _theory_ behind shame resilience and its ideal attributes, but she doesn’t give concrete actionables on how to develop it yourself.

To put theory into practice, we’ve taken the book’s discussions of shame and inferred four steps you can take to grow your shame resilience:

**Step 1:** **Learn how shame manifests for you so that you can identify and address it.** You may experience certain physical sensations when you feel shame, such as a dry mouth or a pounding heart. Or, shame may make you fall into certain thought patterns—for example, “I’m not good enough” or “I’m a bad person.”

**Step 2:** **Identify and evaluate the root cause of your shame.** Shame often comes from not meeting certain expectations. For instance, body shame may be triggered by non-conformity to societal beauty standards. To build shame resilience, consider whether these expectations are really valid or whether they’re unhealthy and unrealistic. _Is not meeting these expectations really something to be ashamed of?_

**Step 3:** **Talk to someone trustworthy about your feelings of shame.** If you refuse to talk about your shame, it will fester and consume you. However, its influence over you will diminish if you get the shame out of your mind and into the world, where you and others can address it.

**Step 4:** **Avoid unhealthy reactions to shame.** Research has shown that [we frequently deal with shame in various unhealthy ways](http://trst.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shame-Humiliation-article-Stone-Institute.pdf), such as distancing ourselves from others, working too hard to please others, and shaming others. **None of these approaches to shame will help you to cultivate worthiness.**

> **Why Are These Unhealthy Reactions to Shame So Damaging to Worthiness?**
> 
> Brown doesn’t go into detail about why these unhealthy reactions to shame damage our worthiness, but it’s worth noting that **they each go against the three key worthiness values of courage, compassion, and connection:**
> 
> - Distancing yourself harms your connections with others and goes against the idea of using ordinary courage to express your true feelings.
>     
> - Shaming people isn’t compassionate and will harm your connections with others.
>     
> - People-pleasing creates an uneven connection based on too much giving and not enough receiving.
>     
> 
> **Further Reading: Brené Brown on Shame**
> 
> While Brown mostly ends her discussion of shame and shame resilience in this book here, she discusses shame further in her other works, including:
> 
> - _[I Thought It Was Just Me](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/298649/i-thought-it-was-just-me-but-it-isnt-by-brene-brown/)_, the book in which she outlines her research into shame, vulnerability, and perfectionism
>     
> - _[Daring Greatly](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly)_, exploring in detail topics such as [the effects of shame on both men and women and how shame inhibits vulnerability](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/daring-greatly/chapter-3)
>     
> - _[Dare to Lead](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, in which she focuses on [shame in the workplace and how leaders can help people who feel ashamed](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-1-4)
