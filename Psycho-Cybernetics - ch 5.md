## Chapter 5: Align Your Self-Image With What You Want

Now that you understand how your imagination can change your self-image, we’ll work through constructive, actionable ways you can generate successful feelings and reprogram your self-image to create goals aligned with success.

First, we’ll explain why it’s important to commit at least 21 days to the process that Maltz suggests. Then, we’ll explore specific methods you can use to finetune your imagination to align your subconscious actions with your conscious goals.

### Commit 21 Days to Prove That You Can Change Your Self-Image

Maltz argues that self-improvement requires action to be effective. **Therefore, if you want to improve your self-image, you need to actively engage with the concepts presented in the book**.

He advises that you practice the concepts without overanalyzing them for at least 21 days. This is because, according to Maltz, the mind takes 21 days to identify with physical and mental changes. **This means that the only way you can prove whether the methods work is by following the process for at least 21 days.** So, although you might not see immediate results from engaging with the concepts, you need to wait several weeks before you can accurately judge whether or not they are effective.

(Shortform note: The popular myth that habits take 21 days to form can be traced back to Maltz (he discusses this concept in various books) and his influence on the self-help movement. Maltz observed that his patients needed an average of 21 days to identify with the changes produced after cosmetic surgery. Subsequent self-help authors accepted this observation as a fact and [the false concept quickly spread into mainstream “knowledge.”](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-it-take-to-form-a-habit#the-21-day-myth) Research has revealed that it actually takes 18-254 days, or an average of 66 days for habits to become automatic.)

### Five Self-Image Alignment Methods

Maltz describes five methods you can use to direct your imagination towards thoughts and feelings of success related to specific goals and the improvement of your self-image.

#### Method 1: Prove That Change Is Possible

Maltz suggests that you choose a habit that you perform daily—one that’s not tied to your self-image, such as brushing your teeth or putting your shoes on—and commit to doing it differently over the course of the 21 days. Every time you make the effort to change this particular habit, affirm to yourself that if you can break this habit, you can also break any negative thought patterns by replacing them with successful thought patterns. For example, if you normally put your right shoe on first, start making the conscious effort to put your left shoe on first. Use the act of putting your shoes on differently to remind yourself that you can choose to think differently.

> **Successful Habit Formation**
> 
> Maltz suggests that you focus on changing a current habit to reinforce your commitment to change your self-image. But he doesn’t provide advice on how to successfully change this habit. Since this is the first step to improve your self-image, it’s necessary to set yourself up to succeed—the more you succeed, the more motivation you’ll have to move forward with the process.
> 
> According to James Clear, author of [Atomic Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits), habits are linked to four stages: cue, craving, response, and reward.
> 
> - **Cue**: This is the trigger that leads you to take action.
>     
> - **Craving**: This is the reward _you expect to receive_ after you take action.
>     
> - **Response**: This is the action you take (the habit).
>     
> - **Reward**: This is the actual reward you receive after you take action.
>     
> 
> Clear explains that you can alter each of the four stages to break existing habits or to create new habits. According to him, you’ll be more likely to stick to the habit you’ve chosen to change if you plan ahead and:
> 
> - **Make the cue obvious** (put a reminder on top of your shoes)
>     
> - **Anticipate your reward** (remind yourself that you’re doing this to improve your self-image so that you can feel happier and more successful)
>     
> - **Ensure you make it easy to respond in the way you want to** (lay your shoes out in the order you want to put them on so that it takes no extra effort)
>     
> - **Reinforce your habit with instant gratification** (congratulate yourself for the effort you’re making in changing your habits and your self-image)
>     

#### Method 2: Relax Your Way to Success

Maltz argues that practicing physical relaxation will enable you to consciously control your imagination and, subsequently, your self-image. **When your mind is relaxed, it’s more receptive to positive suggestions**. This is because negative thoughts create tension in the body—this tension makes it difficult for your subconscious to accept new ideas or possibilities. On the other hand, when you’re in a state of relaxation, negative thoughts tend to disappear. Relaxing your mind and body will create space for your positive suggestions to thrive.

(Shortform note: In addition to creating tension that blocks your subconscious from accepting new thoughts and ideas, [negative and stressful thoughts impact your ability to think about what you’re experiencing](https://compassionworks.com/how-stress-blocks-thinking/#:~:text=Interpretation%3A%20When%20there%20is%20excessive,experience%20to%20give%20it%20perspective.). This is because, when you feel stress, _your amygdala acts as if you’re in danger_: It ensures that you respond automatically to threats by inhibiting the thinking part of your brain (the hippocampus). In other words, **stress and tension stop you from thinking objectively and lead you to act in irrational ways**.)

Relaxation doesn’t only prime you to receive positive thoughts—additionally, Maltz explains that your subconscious requires relaxation to come up with solutions and ideas to help you achieve the goals that you set for it.

- For example, writers often find that their best ideas come when they take a break from periods of intensive research. It’s the space in between their writing sessions, often when they’re thinking about completely different things, that they’re hit with inspiration.

(Shortform note: In _[Deep Work](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/deep-work/chapter-6)_, Cal Newport discusses the benefits of “productive meditation”—using your relaxation time as a constructive way to solve problems. He suggests that you’re more likely to do your best work when you alternate between periods of intense focus and relaxation. While you’re relaxing, your mind will work through the problems you’ve lined up for it and, _without your conscious interference_, can more quickly or creatively arrive at a solution)

Maltz claims that tranquilizers help to relax you because they reduce or eliminate your response to external stimuli. **He cautions against the use of tranquilizers for relaxation** because they don’t actually change the environment or the thing that is disturbing you—they only numb your emotional response to _all_ stimuli. Instead, he recommends that you develop the habit of relaxation because it will help you to become **more aware of how you respond to external stimuli**, tone down any excessive reactions, think rationally, and introduce positive thought patterns with little resistance from your subconscious.

(Shortform note: Even though we’re more aware of the benefits of mindful living, over 60 million people take prescribed tranquilizers every year to combat stress and relieve anxiety. [Tranquilizers are highly addictive and often lead to dependency](https://www.addictionhope.com/tranquilizers/): Users quickly build up their tolerance to the drugs—this means that the more tranquilizers they take, the more they need to feel the calming effect. This addiction impacts users’ physical and psychological well-being, and contributes to a third of all reported drug-related deaths.)

Maltz suggests that you set aside 15-30 minutes a day to imagine yourself as relaxed and calm as possible. The more you practice relaxation, the more accustomed your mind and body will become to feeling this way. Practicing relaxation every day will help you to be more aware of your thoughts, think more rationally, and allow your subconscious mind to solve problems for you.

> **The Benefits of Walking Meditation**
> 
> If you’re not keen on the idea of sitting or lying down to relax, consider [walking meditation](https://mindworks.org/blog/what-is-walking-meditation/): the process of practicing mindfulness as you walk. Walking meditation offers the same benefits as sitting meditation: You’ll feel more relaxed, more aware of your inner self, healthier (mentally and physically), and maybe even a little joyful.
> 
> In addition, according to some neuroscientists, [walking improves your ability to deal with stressful situations](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/cognitive-mapping-neuroscience-brain-stress-improve-mood/) because it naturally amplifies the neural activation necessary to solve problems. This happens because your cognitive mapping functions—otherwise known as your “internal GPS” (the part of your brain that stores all of the information you need about your environment)—are supported by the same systems that you use to solve problems. So when you walk, your brain activates the same area of your brain that works to solve problems.

##### Create a Peaceful Room in Your Mind

In addition to spending time every day to practice relaxation, Maltz suggests that you clearly imagine a relaxing and peaceful room in your mind that you can retreat to throughout the day whenever you need a break or a mental pick-me-up. You’ll find it particularly useful to visit this peaceful room when you need to switch between different tasks that require different mindsets. For example, when you need to switch from working intensely on a project to reading your kids a calm bedtime story.

(Shortform note: If you find it difficult to visualize a peaceful room in your mind, Abraham Hicks provides a useful Law of Attraction technique to help you switch mindsets when you need to: [segment intending](https://www.effortlesssuperhuman.com.au/the-law-of-segment-intending/). To use this process, set an intention about how you aim to feel before moving into a new situation. For example, if you’ve just returned home after a stressful day, and need to get your kids to bed, you could set the following intention: “I intend to feel relaxed and to engage with my kids in a meaningful way.” Declaring your intent in this way encourages self-awareness and self-control—you’re more likely to be aware of your automatic reactions and, therefore, more able to choose your behaviors.)

#### Method 3: Imagine Your Successful Personality

Maltz suggests that you use your imagination to think about the person you want to be and to recall your successful memories.

Maltz argues that each time you create or recall successful feelings, your subconscious will record them and imprint them into your self-image. These successful feelings will accumulate in your self-image and will lead to new, automatic responses to your experiences—in other words, you’ll gradually find yourself _naturally_ feeling and acting more successfully.

In addition to your relaxation time, set aside 15-30 minutes a day to visualize and think about what sort of person you would be if you freed yourself from everything that is holding you back—such as your negative self-image, the expectations of others, or specific fears. Come up with different situations and **imagine how your “positive and successful self” would react**. Make your images as vivid and as detailed as possible.

- For example, if you imagine yourself driving a car, picture yourself sitting in the car relaxed and confident. Notice the small sensory details to make it feel more real—the weight and feel of the steering wheel, the hum of the air-conditioning, the way the upholstery smells, and so on. The most important thing is to _feel_ successful throughout this time.

> **When Visualization Creates a False Sense of Achievement**
> 
> While visualizing a successful version of yourself can lead you to act in successful ways, in _[Ego Is the Enemy](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-1a)_, Ryan Holiday claims that it can also confuse your subconscious mind and create the opposite effect: When your subconscious believes that you’ve already achieved something, **you feel that** you’ve made progress despite not having taken any measurable steps toward achieving your goal.
> 
> **This feeling of progress feels good, but it’s based on a false sense of achievement that may cause you to lose sight of the actions you need to take to move forward.** In fact, researchers examining [the effects of visualization on goal achievement](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/positive-fantasies-about-idealized-futures-sap-energy) found that participants often lost the energy required to fulfill their goal because once they convinced themselves they’d already achieved the goal, they lost interest in trying to progress toward it.

In addition, make the effort to **remember successful experiences from your past**—times when you felt satisfied and self-confident. Your subconscious doesn’t know the difference between past, present, or future, so memories of your past successes will impact your subconscious and accumulate alongside all of the successful feelings you create.

(Shortform note: Successful experiences can be hard to recall because [people are programmed to forget good memories](https://neurosciencenews.com/fading-happy-memories-7120/). To make this process easier, keep a journal to record all of your successful experiences when you remember them. This way, you’ll have a collection of memories to refer to each time you take the time to practice.)

#### Method 4: Focus on a Goal

Maltz argues that you need to find a reason to change your self-image before you can develop the skills to change it. In other words, you should know what results you hope to achieve with an improved self-image. **Without a clear reason, you’re unlikely to find the motivation you need to make the required changes**.

So, if you want to change your self-image so that you can feel more inner peace, think about why you want this—what you’ll get, or what improvements you hope to see in your life once you make this change. For example, will you get along better with your family, or feel more productive at work?

Once you’ve thought of something that your successful self would want to achieve, break it down and think of the first step that you can realistically achieve—Maltz argues that it’s important to develop the habit of success early on so that you can gradually build up your self-confidence to achieve more demanding goals.

For example, if you’d love to compete in a marathon but you don’t currently have an exercise routine, your realistic goal would be to go for a short run a couple of times a week. Clearly visualize yourself going for a run and imagine how good you’ll feel about yourself after your first run. Remember, your subconscious can’t tell the difference between real feelings and imagined feelings so, if you feel successful while you’re imagining yourself going for a run, your subconscious will believe that you’re capable of going for a run, and make it easier for you to achieve.

> **How to Overcome Your Mind’s Resistance to Change**
> 
> Maltz argues that your habits are a result of your current self-image. If you want to create new habits to support a more positive self-image, you need to take small achievable steps to develop the habit of success. This is because the bigger the change you want to make, the more your mind is going to resist it—your mind’s job is to protect you. If it believes that you’re attempting to do things that will cause it harm, it will resist every attempt that you make with feelings of fear or inhibition.
> 
> - For example, imagine that you’re afraid of heights and your goal is to jump out of a plane (because this is your version of a successful and fearless self-image). Your mind is so accustomed to being afraid of heights that even the suggestion of jumping out of a plane causes it to stimulate your nervous system into producing a panic attack.
> 
> So how can you get past this resistance so that you can achieve what you want? In _[The Kaizen Way](https://www.scienceofexcellence.com/)_, Psychologist Rober Maurer claims that you’re more likely to make successful changes if you take very small but regular steps toward the large goal you intend to achieve. This is because small changes are more likely to bypass your brain’s instinctive reaction to resist new behavioral changes.
> 
> So, if you’re afraid of heights but want to achieve the goal of jumping out of a plane, begin by taking the tiniest step toward combating your fear of heights you can imagine, such as standing on a chair. The next day, stand on a low table, and so on. Each time you take another step, you’ll demonstrate to your brain that you’re safe regardless of how high up you are, and you’ll eventually succeed without fear or resistance.

##### Create Successful Feedback Loops

**Your current personality traits and habits are a result of your current self-image**. When you have clear goals in mind, you can more easily check that the habits you’ve chosen to develop reinforce your efforts to achieve those goals, and strive to develop more successful habits. These success habits will help you to see yourself in a more positive light and encourage you to take actions that lead to the results that you want. **This positive feedback loop will train your mind to approach your goal with an attitude of success**.

For example, to achieve your long-term goal of running a marathon, you’ll need to develop a healthier lifestyle. You begin by introducing a light exercise routine into your life so that you can start to view yourself as a healthy person. The more you view yourself as a healthy person, the more likely you are to continue exercising and feel the benefits. The more benefits you feel from exercising, the more likely you are to see yourself as a healthy person.

(Shortform note: In _[Awaken the Giant Within](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/awaken-the-giant-within/chapter-2)_, Tony Robbins expands upon Maltz’s concept that feedback loops reinforce specific behaviors by arguing that **neuro-associations—the way your brain links certain experiences with pain and others with pleasure—influence all of your decisions and behaviors**. According to Robbins, your brain relies on these neuro-associations to direct your behavior _toward feeling pleasure_ and _away from feeling pain_, and you have to reprogram these associations to create new patterns of behavior. So, for the example above, you need to program your mind to associate healthy behaviors with pleasurable feelings in order for this habit to stick. For example, you could take the scenic route when you go for a run, or plan to reward yourself every time you complete a run.)

##### Focus on One Thing at a Time

Maltz argues that your levels of stress and anxiety increase when you allow yourself to get distracted by too many thoughts. But when you decide to pursue a well-defined goal, you set priorities for what you choose to focus your attention on, and this reduces your mind’s propensity to wander.

He believes that you’re more likely to achieve success if you focus on one thing at a time, and do it to the best of your ability without distractions. This will increase your sense of self-satisfaction and contribute to your successful feedback loop. So, focus on the moment—**give your full attention to what you’re doing and don’t move on to another task until you’ve completed the first one**.

(Shortform note: Like Maltz, Gary Keller, author of _[The One Thing](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-one-thing)_, believes that you’re more likely to achieve the success you want when you focus on one thing at a time. This is because _success builds on success_. He suggests that you prioritize the actions you need to complete to reach your goals—break down your goal into a series of logical steps that take you from _where you are_ to _where you want to be_—and **_focus exclusively_** on completing **each step in sequential order**. With each step you complete, you’ll build your momentum and find it easier to complete each subsequent step.)

#### Method 5: Choose Happiness Now

Maltz argues that genuine success and wellbeing come from cultivating and developing the habit of happiness in your life. Further, he claims that your mental attitude influences the way that your body heals.

This idea came about from an observation that Maltz made repeatedly throughout his career: Patients who were optimistic and had things to look forward to in life generally recovered from surgery faster than patients who didn’t feel any satisfaction in life. In other words, Maltz claims that happy people are generally healthier and more resilient to physical setbacks because they expect to get well and have a reason to get well.

On the other hand, unhappy people suffer from poor health and wellbeing because they don’t have a reason to get better—they don’t have anything to look forward to. Studies have shown results that support his idea that negative attitudes are bad for your health. For example, stressed out and unhappy people often suffer from ulcers and high blood pressure and are more likely to develop addictive behaviors and less likely to engage in healthy routines.

> **How Negative Thought Patterns Impact Health**
> 
> Multiple research experiments confirm Maltz’s claim that mental attitudes impact health. Studies on the impact of negative mental states (depression, stress, anxiety) on health confirm that **[negative attitudes are bad for your health](https://www.stress.org/how-does-stress-affect-your-body-the-latest-research-shows-it-can-vary)**. Prolonged negativity affects your:
> 
> - **Hormones**: Leads to increased heart rate and high blood pressure.
>     
> - **Immune system**: Makes you more vulnerable to illnesses and infections.
>     
> - **Sleep**: Prevents your mind from relaxing.
>     
> - **Brain**: [Increases cognitive decline](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/negative-thinking-can-harm-brain-increase-dementia-risk).
>     
> - **Digestion**: Damages your gut (indigestion, vomiting, constipation).
>     
> 
> These researchers suggest that you can reduce your levels of stress and negativity by undertaking a daily ritual such as meditation, therapy, or physical exercise.

##### An Active Mind Is a Happy Mind

The realization that success comes from cultivating happiness led Maltz to think about _what makes people feel happy_. Maltz argues that **your mind is designed to achieve goals**. You’re more likely to feel interested and engaged in your life when you give your mind goals to pursue. **The more you pursue satisfying goals, the more you have to look forward to and engage with**. This makes you want to look after your health and your wellbeing. As a result, you're more inclined to feel happy.

(Shortform note: Like Maltz, the author of [Flow](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/flow/1-page-summary) argues that people are more likely to feel happy when they focus all of their attention on completing tasks and achieving goals. He claims that the more you direct your focus to achieve a goal, the more absorbed you feel in what you’re doing. **This sense of absorption makes it difficult for your mind to wander and get distracted by negative thoughts**. This process trains your mind to feel satisfied and happy—your mind gets used to experiencing satisfaction and this feeling impacts your overall mood and behavior.)

In contrast, if you stop pursuing goals, you find it difficult to find meaning in your life, and your physical health reflects this. For example, it’s common to hear about people that suffer from depression or severe illness within a few months of retirement. Maltz argues that this is because they no longer feel satisfied—their jobs gave them active goals and made them feel important and valued. When they don’t provide themselves with meaningful goals to replace their jobs, they feel useless and worthless and their bodies literally give up.

> **Why Retirement Leads to Illness**
> 
> Maltz’s conclusion that retired people suffer illnesses when they don’t replace their jobs with meaningful goals was confirmed in a recent study. It revealed that [retirement increases the chances of suffering](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22553577) from clinical depression by 40%, and of being diagnosed with a physical illness by 60%. This is because it leads to:
> 
> - **Loneliness**—if there is no social life outside of the workplace.
>     
> - **Inactivity**—if the motivation to leave the house was only linked to the daily commute to work.
>     
> - **Old age**—if poor lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking create health problems.
>     
> 
> Experts agree that [you can enjoy a happy retirement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/03/27/the-9-keys-to-a-happy-retirement/?sh=2894f6ee40e8) if you plan ahead and create ways to stay engaged in meaningful activities, look after your health, and make the effort to socialize with friends and family.

##### Make the Decision to Be Happy Regardless of External Circumstances

It’s important to note that, while the pursuit of goals will increase your chances of feeling happy, you’ll only experience the benefits if you _let yourself feel happy and satisfied_ throughout the process. People tend to delay their happiness—they wait until they’ve achieved or acquired something until they let themselves feel happy. Life is full of problems, minor annoyances, and challenges—there’s always an excuse to be unhappy.

However, Maltz argues that you shouldn’t wait to achieve your goals to feel happy—you should choose to see the best in every experience and decide to feel happy now. This becomes easier the more you remember that your opinions about experiences determine how you feel, not the experiences themselves.

(Shortform note: Throughout the book, Maltz argues that you need to experience success and happiness _internally_ before you see the results _externally_. Similarly, _[The Happiness Advantage](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-advantage)_ applies the latest research in neuroscience and positive psychology to argue that **happiness isn’t the _result_ of success, but the _cause_ of it**. When you choose to cultivate the habit of thinking positive thoughts, you train your brain to find opportunities in adversity and find it easier to overcome challenges and setbacks. This creates positive momentum in your life and fuels further opportunities to feel happy.)
