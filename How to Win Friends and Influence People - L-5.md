## Likability 5: Discuss the Other Person’s Interests

### Principles

- Using an earlier analogy, why fish with cheesecake? Fish with the bait that the partner wants. People are usually far more enthusiastic about topics they care about than ones only you care about.

### Tactics

- **Before meeting someone, research their interests thoroughly** so you have a working knowledge of the field.
- Look around for clues of their interest - keepsakes, news articles. Then have a genuine interest and ask them about it.
- **Identify someone’s major goals, then talk about how you’ll help them get closer to their goals.** Especially useful for job applications.
- Note what people spend a lot of time on, what they are clearly proud of. Point it out, show appreciation for that.

### Examples

- A boy scout troop manager looking for funding approached a president of a corporation. Before his meeting, he read that the president had a million-dollar check bounce. At first meeting, he asked to see the check, saying he’d never seen such a check before and wanting to boast to his friends that he had seen such a check. The president gladly agreed, then also agreed to the boy scout manager’s request for funding. Note how the scout did this instead of phrasing his own interests first.
- If you’re applying to a job where the founder has a drive for power or money, then talk about how you’ll help them gain more money. If they’re more of a missionary, then talk about how you will achieve their mission.
- When visiting an elderly aunt-in-law, a man admired the house and its craftsmanship, when otherwise most relatives left her alone. The aunt showed him around and explained all the memories, then desired to leave her deceased husband’s car with the man because of his appreciation of fine things.
