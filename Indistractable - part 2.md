## Part 2: Build Your Schedule Around Your Values

The second part of becoming indistractable is learning to schedule your day around traction-supporting activities—that is, activities that pull you toward what you want to do and who you want to be.

### Why Scheduling Is Essential to Indistractablity

Two-thirds of Americans report that they don’t plan out their days. **Although an unplanned day might make you _feel_ that you have more freedom over how your day is spent, it actually creates _less_ freedom—instead of controlling your day, your day controls you.** When your time isn’t structured, it’s all too easy to give it up to distractions that feel urgent or necessary. You get to the end of the day having done a lot, but none of the things you _meant_ to do.

Often, people try to add structure to their days by creating to-do lists. This is one of the _worst_ ways to plan your day, for several reasons:

- It’s easy to move unfinished tasks to the next day, then move the next day’s unfinished tasks to the _next_ day, and so on. The tasks never get done and continue to loom over you.
- As your tasks get bumped from day to day, the list expands as you think of new tasks that need to be done. This creates ample opportunity for distraction—you’re likely to choose the easiest tasks on the list instead of buckling down and completing the bigger and more difficult tasks.

**The natural solution to distraction-filled days and the “I’ll do it later” mindset is creating a schedule and _sticking to it_.**

### Consider Your Values and Responsibilities

**You should build your schedule around the three responsibilities that take up all of your time—you, your relationships, and your work—and your _values_ in each.** Your values represent what’s important to you and who you want to be.

- Your values may look like: mindfulness and learning for yourself, equality and presence in your relationships, and creativity and variety at work.

It’s crucial to build your schedule around them because mismanaged values trigger distraction. The values in different parts of your life usually won’t quite intersect, so you must consciously balance them. If you accidentally concentrate too much on the values in one part of your life, your values elsewhere will suffer from neglect.

- For example, focusing too much on your work can cause you to miss out on time with your spouse or may cause you to miss family dinners.

When your values are unbalanced, you become stressed or feel that you’re “not enough.” These feelings of stress or dissatisfaction will drive you to distracting habits—leaving you with even _less_ time for fully living your values.

**Your values become easier to live—and balance—when you consciously track how your time is spent on each responsibility.** On a schedule, you can not only visualize the balance between your values but can also better distinguish between traction and distraction. _Any behavior that happens at a time it’s not scheduled is a distraction, even if it feels productive._

- For example, you make time for playing with your kids at the park on Saturday afternoon. During that time, you ended up answering a few work emails—a _distraction_ from what you meant to do with your time, though it may have felt productive.

Through the rest of this chapter, we’ll examine how each of your three responsibilities should show up in your life, then discuss how to build and maintain an indistractable schedule.

#### Responsibility 1: You

**Taking care of yourself and meeting your personal values is the _core_ of your life.** If you’re suffering in the “you” department, your relationships and work will suffer, so it’s crucial that your personal values are scheduled first instead of squeezed around other activities. Spending time on yourself looks like:

- Taking care of yourself with exercise, healthy eating, and good hygiene
- Spending time on things that you enjoy, such as your hobbies or entertainment, or taking a “day off.”
- Engaging in spirituality or mindfulness

##### How to Schedule “You” Time

There are two parts to building meaningful “you” time into your schedule. First, schedule time for meeting your basic needs such as sleeping, eating, and grooming. You may think scheduling basic self-care is unnecessary, but you’ve likely sacrificed sleep for spending time on social media or healthy eating for ordering takeout. When you have these basic needs on your schedule and compare them with what happened in reality, you can more easily see unhealthy patterns of distraction.

Second, think about who you want to be and the qualities you want to have, and what value-aligned activities you can schedule.

- For example, if one of your values is “mindfulness,” you might schedule 15 minutes of gratitude reflection in the morning. If one of your values is “staying healthy,” you might schedule an hour-long walk every morning.

#### Responsibility 2: Your Relationships

**It’s essential to schedule your relationships because they’re easily ignored when something urgent or important comes up, meaning your loved ones get your _leftover_ time, not your _dedicated_ time.** Make time for _non-negotiable_ _commitments_ to your relationships with your family and friends every week.

##### Commit Time to Family

Schedule regular indistractable time with your kids. This time is a commitment, not something that can be pushed aside for another activity or interrupted by your email or social media.

- For example, you might dedicate several device-free hours every Saturday afternoon doing an activity of your child’s choosing.

It’s important to schedule time with your partner, too. This may not make sense to you because you _live_ with your partner—you already spend plenty of time with them. However, it’s likely that much of this time together isn’t aligned with your values.

- For example, you might be having dinner together every night but watching television in silence instead of enjoying each other’s company.

**Schedule _deliberate_ time together, such as date nights, projects you want to work on together, or tech-free outings.**

##### Commit Time to Friends

Friendship is incredibly important to your well-being, yet is easily overshadowed by the everyday wants and needs of your partner, children, and work. Without maintenance, your friendships easily dissipate, and it becomes harder to reconnect.

Your plans with friends need to be _regular, set events_ in your schedule, not “someday” items on a to-do list. Otherwise, it becomes too easy to prioritize something else—like a weekend project nagging at you—or flake out for unimportant reasons—such as simply feeling too lazy to go to that dinner party.

- For example, you might organize a weekly potluck with a small group of friends that rotates between houses. This dinner should be a _set commitment_ among your friends. Because this event happens every week as a group, members can occasionally miss it if they must—the rest of the group can get together without them, and they can rejoin the next week.

#### Responsibility 3: Your Work

It’s crucial that the way you’re spending your time at work is well-aligned with what you want to do and who you want to be—otherwise, your workday can easily become disorganized and distracted by constant emails, people coming into your office, last-minute meetings, and so on. All these distractions make your work feel overwhelming and unfulfilling, or they pressure you to spend more time on work than on yourself or your relationships.

**A schedule lets your manager understand your distractions, see how your time is spent, and help you balance your values both _inside_ and _outside_ the office.**

##### How Your Schedule Balances Values at Work

Your schedule gives your manager a clear idea of how your time is being spent, which helps them contextualize problems such as late projects, a slump in productivity, and so on.

With this information and an understanding of your values, they can suggest areas where you might reprioritize your tasks or cut out activities that aren’t serving your goals and theirs.

- For example, you may be taking on too many projects and offering to mentor many people because you’ll be seeking a promotion within the next few years. This is making you increasingly frazzled and disorganized. When your manager understands your motivations and looks at your schedule, they can explain that spending more time on boosting your sales and less time on mentoring would be more helpful to their goals and _won’t_ hurt your chances of promotion.

**When your manager helps you define what’s important and what’s not important, it becomes easier for you to say “no” to things that would distract you, disorganize you, or cut into the time meant for your other responsibilities.**

##### How Your Schedule Balances Values Outside of Work

Your work-related schedule should note any _non-negotiable_ commitments that happen outside the workplace. This helps your manager know when it is and isn’t appropriate to ask you to do extra work or stay late.

- For example, if your weekly schedule shows Thursday night blocked off for family, your manager understands that it’s _not_ reasonable or appropriate to ask you to stay late. However, if there are no non-negotiables on your Wednesday night schedule, your manager could reasonably ask to cut into that time if a project is truly urgent.

**This system works best when you make it a priority to check in _regularly_ with your manager about your schedule.**

- If you can plan your schedule weekly, schedule a 15-minute meeting every Monday morning to go over it together, and align on your expectations for the week. Your manager can suggest places to reshuffle priorities and note when they can and cannot interrupt you—at work and at home.
- If you have a schedule that changes every day, meet with your manager for five minutes at the beginning of the day.

### How to Build an Indistractable Schedule

Reflect on how your three responsibilities show up in your life and ask yourself three questions:

**1) “What is or isn’t working in my current schedule?”** Think about responsibilities that are taking too much of your attention and values that are being neglected.

- For example, you’re spending too many late nights at work, which is cutting into your relationship value of being a present parent.

**2) “What activities would better align with my values?”** Think about parts of your day where you sacrifice your values in one area for another, and imagine how activities would look different if you stuck to _one_ responsibility at a time.

- For example, you might frequently check work emails while spending time with your children, instead of listening to their stories. Focusing on _just_ your children would make you a more present parent.

**3) “How much time do I want to allocate to each of my responsibilities?”** Think about the ways your _ideal_ schedule would allow more time for some values and restrict others.

- For example, you might want an hour each day to work on your hobbies or ensure that your work responsibilities never interfere with your weekend.

**Your answers to these questions reveal how your time will _ideally_ be spent. Next, build your ideal schedule using two essential elements of indistractable scheduling: _timeboxing_ and _no blank spaces_.**

#### Element 1: Timeboxing

Timeboxing is a way of organizing your calendar by dedicating blocks of time to specific activities. For example, you might timebox “read to kids” or “go through emails.” Timeboxing serves two purposes:

**1) It helps you balance your responsibilities.** Limiting the time you can spend on an activity stops you from working on it “until it’s done” as you might with tasks on a to-do list. This prevents you from letting one responsibility take up too much of your time at the expense of another.

- For example, you see how staying late at work to wrap up projects regularly cuts out your scheduled gym time, revealing how much you’re neglecting your personal values in favor of your work values.

**2) It helps you stick to what you’re _meant_ to be doing.** Timeboxing creates what psychologists call an “implementation intention”—you decide _what_ you'll do and _when_ you’ll do it, which can help you get tasks done instead of perpetually pushing them off. Additionally, timeboxing stops small, easy tasks from interrupting what you’re doing because you establish a specific time you’ll take care of them.

- For example, if you’re in the middle of a difficult client proposal, you might think, “I’m so busy today—I’ll get in touch with Sheila and Bill tomorrow,” or “I should return Sheila’s call and email Bill now, before I forget.” A timeboxed schedule would help you avoid both of these mindsets: “I’ve blocked off an hour this afternoon for catching up on calls and emails. I’ll get in touch with Sheila and Bill at that time.”

#### Element 2: No Blank Space

**You must schedule everything you do, because it’s the only way to accurately gauge your indistractability—that is, how often you do what you planned.** It doesn’t matter so much what your schedule looks like—it matters that you _stick to it_.

- For example, if you _plan_ to spend all morning on Reddit and do so, you were indistractable—doing what you planned to. On the other hand, if you planned to spend an hour watching television but answered a few work emails on your phone, you were distracted—not doing what you planned.

### How to Maintain Your Schedule

Keep in mind that the first schedule you create is _ideal_—your reality usually won’t match up on the first try. If you expect perfection, you’ll end up stressed or discouraged, which triggers _more_ distracted behaviors. Two mindsets will help you optimize your schedule without stressing about it.

#### Mindset 1: Your Schedule Is a Constant Experiment

It’s crucial that you _continually_ reflect on how you spend your time in reality, identify strong and weak points of your schedule, and make edits. Each week, take 20 minutes to reflect on two questions:

**1) When did I do what I planned to do? When did I become distracted?** Reflect on this question while looking over your weekly distraction tracker so that you can easily pinpoint _reasons_ for your distractions.

- You may find that internal triggers are worse at a certain time of day or that one colleague has a tendency to interrupt you.

**2) What schedule changes might help me avoid distraction?** Sometimes, distraction happens in your schedule as an unpredictable, one-time event—such as a major problem at work forcing you to miss family dinner three nights in a row. These types of distractions don’t usually warrant changing your schedule.

On the other hand, many distractions happen because your schedule has a flaw or doesn’t allow for or circumvent a predictable event. In these cases, you need to make changes.

- For example, you scheduled quality time with your daughter on Friday nights from 6-7, but you forgot that she has karate practice—so you spend the time on your phone. To fix this, you’d move the quality time to another day or to the hour after karate.
- Or imagine that you have a colleague who always interrupts you after she gets back from lunch to see what you need help with during the afternoon. You can fix this by timeboxing 10 minutes before lunch to email her updates and help requests. Let her know about this new system so she doesn’t come looking for you after lunch.

By frequently reflecting on your schedule, you’ll become more aware of what parts of your day support traction or cause distraction. **Over time, you’ll adjust your schedule and experiment with new ways to gain traction—eventually helping you create a refined schedule that meets all your values and truly works with your life.**

#### Mindset 2: You Can Control Input, Not Outcome

One thing that can be frustrating about making your schedule is that you sometimes don’t get the outcome you _want_, despite making the time for it. **These setbacks can make you feel frustrated and stressed, throwing you off track.**

- For example, you set aside seven hours for sleep—but when you get in bed and turn out the light, you feel wide awake. You become so worried about not sleeping that you make yourself even _more_ sleepless. You reach for your phone and start scrolling.

**Reduce the stress around your schedule by understanding that the outcome of your efforts won’t always be within your control—all you _can_ control is the effort you put in.** Your responsibility is to be in the right place at the scheduled time. Even if your body doesn’t cooperate with you, you’re at least providing the necessary input.

- For example, if you timebox 7 to 8 p.m. for work on an essay, you should be sitting at your desk at 7 p.m. with the document open in front of you. You might not have the motivation or inspiration to make much headway on it, but at the very least, you’re sitting at your desk as planned.
- On the other hand, imagine you _didn’t_ control your input—7 p.m. rolls around and you’re in the kitchen making tea before heading to your desk. You don’t feel very motivated, so you scroll through your emails. The hour counts as a distraction because you weren’t sticking to your plan.

**While the outcome may not be what you hoped, you can at least make sure you’re giving yourself the best possible chance to do what you planned.**
