4. `space-between`: This value evenly distributes the flex items along the main axis, with the first item aligned to the start edge and the last item aligned to the end edge. The remaining space is divided equally between the items.
    
5. `space-around`: This value evenly distributes the flex items along the main axis, with equal space placed before the first item and after the last item. The remaining space is divided equally between the items.
    
6. `space-evenly`: This value evenly distributes the flex items along the main axis, including before the first item and after the last item. The space between and around each item is equal.
