## Part 3.1: Cut Out External Triggers: Communication Without Boundaries

**The third element of becoming indistractable is reducing the external triggers in your life.** While internal triggers are frequent drivers of distraction, external triggers constantly invade our lives with beeps, pop-up notifications, vibrations, alarms, and so on. They tempt you with an escape from any internal discomfort you may be feeling.

**It’s vital that you get a handle on the external triggers around you because they don’t just interrupt you for a moment—they can derail your workflow for an extended period.** Research shows that when people are interrupted during a task—to answer a message or check their email, for example—they’ll try to compensate when they return to the task by working faster, but with higher stress levels.

Unfortunately, the answer isn’t so easy as refusing to respond to incoming emails or turning your phone facedown.

- One study showed that simply _receiving_ a notification is just as distracting as _responding_ to a message or call.
- Furthermore, the mere presence of your phone—even if you’re not looking at it—strains your attention because a portion of your mental energy is allocated to ignoring your phone.

#### Sort Your External Triggers

Deciding how to handle external triggers can be complicated because while most are distractions, _some_ can help you build traction.

- For example, you may have alarms that keep you on track with your timeboxed schedule, health apps that send reminders to drink water and stretch, and so on.

It’s up to you to decide which of your device’s triggers are useful and which are distracting. **Give each trigger an _honest_ assessment by asking yourself: Does this trigger benefit _me_, or do I benefit _it_?**

There are two types of external triggers you’ll have to adjust in your life—triggers that come from a lack of boundaries around your communication with others, and triggers that stem from the technology you use every day. In this chapter, we’ll explore ways to reduce distraction from communication without boundaries, and in the next chapter we’ll discuss technology triggers.

### Trigger #1: Other People

_Other people_ are some of the most pervasive distractions in your workplace. **This problem is especially present in modern office environments, as 70% of American offices have adopted “open floor plans.”** This means that employees don’t have closed-off workspaces that they can retreat to for deep focus. Instead, they’re in the middle of a sea of triggers—they can see what their colleagues are doing, overhear conversations, see who’s coming in and out, smell the donuts in the break room, and so on. These constant distractions slow down your work, force you to catch up by working faster with more stress, and decrease your overall satisfaction.

#### Send the Right Message

**You can’t control everything that’s happening around you in your work environment, but you _can_ control your messaging.** Create an obvious visual cue that tells other people that you’re not available for interruption. This can take any form that makes sense to you:

- A large piece of cardstock on the top of your computer monitor with a message such as, “I’m focusing right now, please come back later.”
- Taping a sign to the back of your chair that says, “Please don’t interrupt me right now. I’ll be available at 3.”
- A designated hat or pair of headphones that signify deep focus time

It’s important to talk to everyone in your workspace—whether you’re in an office environment or working from home—about your system, for three reasons.

1. You ensure that they understand your commitment to being indistractable and don’t interrupt you.
2. They’re forced to think about their behaviors, and they’ll be more aware of interrupting you and others in the future.
3. They may learn from you and make their own signal to show that they need time without interruptions.

### Trigger #2: Email

Checking your email and responding to messages may _feel_ productive, but it’s a huge source of distraction in your life. **The average employee receives 100+ emails per day—that means that if you spend just two minutes reading and replying to each message, you’re spending nearly _three and a half hours_ per day on email.** Compounding email’s distracting power is the fact that, on average, it takes you 64 seconds to refocus on your work after checking your email. Every time your phone dings with an email alert, you lose at least a minute.

The total time you spend on email is made up of a) how much time you spend checking your inbox and b) how much time you spend responding to messages. By reducing the time you spend on these activities, you can reclaim hours of your day.

#### Part 1: Spend Less Time Checking Your Inbox

**You may _rationally_ know that checking your email constantly is a waste of your time and a serious interruption of your focus—but most of us just can’t stop.** This is due to two elements of human psychology.

**1) Your inbox offers _random rewards_.** When you can’t predict when an action will reward you, the action becomes exciting or tempting. This is the same factor that makes gambling so addictive—you never know if the next $20 you bet will reward you with a jackpot. Your inbox delivers random rewards in the same fashion. Sometimes it contains useless or boring messages, other times an important message from your boss, a piece of good news, or a message from a friend. You can’t stop checking, _just in case_ the next click delivers a reward.

- **Make your inbox as predictable as possible to make it less tempting.** Unsubscribe from any emails that aren’t useful any longer, such as newsletters or retail promos. You can do this in a dedicated hour, or streamline your inbox over a matter of weeks by unsubscribing from unwanted emails as they come in.

**2) You’re inclined to reciprocate communication.** Humans are social creatures that mirror the actions of others—when someone smiles at you, you’ll smile back. While this _reciprocity cycle_ is fine in person, helping you establish social connections, it becomes a problem online. When someone sends you a message, you’re naturally inclined to respond right away. Unfortunately, this prompts the _other_ person to respond right away, which triggers you to respond—it becomes a stressful, fast-paced cycle. **By finding ways to _send_ fewer emails, you can break the cycle of reciprocity and ensure that you’ll _receive_ fewer emails.** There are two ways to accomplish this.

- **Create office hours for non-urgent matters.** Instead of responding to someone’s question right away, you might say, “I have some time open on Wednesday and Friday from 2-3. If you’d still like to talk about this at that time, feel free to stop by my desk!” This prevents you and the other person from replying back and forth multiple times and creates a “cooling off” period for the question—often, the sender will find a solution on their own, or the problem resolves itself or becomes irrelevant.
- **Manually slow down reciprocity.** Most people send emails immediately after writing them. When you and another person are keeping up a fast-paced back-and-forth, the matter can feel deserving of your immediate attention—even when it’s not urgent at all. Use your email service’s “delayed delivery” tool to send your emails a few hours or days after you write them. This clears the email off your plate but doesn’t prompt a quick reply from the other person. Additionally, this service can prevent you from getting replies when you don’t want them—for example, if you answer emails on Friday afternoons but don’t want replies over the weekend, you can delay their delivery until Monday morning.

#### Part 2: Spend Less Time Responding to Emails

Reducing the number of emails you receive each day will drastically reduce the amount of time you spend in your inbox. The second step is to set up a system that reduces the amount of time you spend responding to those you _do_ let through. **The most efficient way to deal with your emails is by going through them in batches during dedicated email timeboxes, rather than dealing with them as they come in.** Processing your email in this way has two advantages:

1. This reduces the number of times your brain needs to switch between tasks (meaning you lose “refocusing time” once, instead of many times throughout the day).
2. You can _schedule_ it—so that it becomes the thing you mean to do, instead of the thing dragging you away from what needs to get done.

**Make your batch-processing as efficient as possible by _eliminating the need to check emails repeatedly._** Many people open messages, scan the contents, reply to anything urgent, and then leave everything else for later. By the _next_ time you check your email, you’ve forgotten what the “everything else” emails said, so you open them again. This happens every time you check your email—you read the same emails, multiple times a day.

The main reason you read emails multiple times is to discern exactly when you need to reply to them—fix the issue by categorizing your emails by reply urgency. To do this, create two email tags: “Today” and “This Week.” Each time you check your email, answer anything that needs an immediate reply, then tag the rest to be answered during your email timebox later in the day or later in the week. **This system ensures that you only read each email twice: when you initially receive it and when you reply.**

### Trigger #3: Group Chat

Having a group chat feature at work can be helpful for chatting about ideas or getting quick answers, but it’s also distracting in several ways. First, the messages you’re receiving all day are from different people, in different channels, about different subjects—essentially, part of your brain is in numerous meetings covering diverse topics all day, while you’re trying to focus on your own work. Second, many people use group chat to fire off thoughts one sentence at a time. Receiving ideas as a stream of consciousness can make you feel frazzled, and the constant message alerts don’t help.

#### Create Group Chat Guidelines

Set three rules around your group chat use so that it shows up in your workday as a _tool for traction_, rather than invading your workday as a distraction.

##### 1) Use Group Chat Sparingly

While the real-time feature of group chat can be useful and engaging, think of it as you would any other real-time communication.

- For example, you wouldn’t agree to be on a conference call all day with six people who occasionally call for your input while you’re trying to do your work.

In the same way, set boundaries around how much of your time and attention people can have via group chat. There are two ways to do this:

- **Timebox group chat sessions.** Schedule time to scan for missed messages, send out replies, or scroll through different channels. Communicate your schedule to your colleagues so they understand when they can expect replies. When you’re not online, set an “away” message such as, “I’m not checking messages now but will be online later. If your issue is urgent, please call me or stop by my desk.”
- **Organize meetings.** If you have to discuss an issue that doesn’t necessitate an in-person meeting, set up a time for everyone to be in the group chat together to talk in real-time. This not only saves everyone from being pinged at random all day but also prevents the disruption of going to an in-person meeting.

##### 2) Keep Groups Small

If you’re creating a chat group, limit invitees to those who will truly contribute to the conversation and benefit from it—usually the two or three people who are most relevant to the issue. Everyone has a chance to contribute to these smaller discussions, and less central parties can be updated later via email.

##### 3) Use Group Chat for the Right Topics

This isn’t the right communication medium for sensitive topics or large issues, for several reasons. First, when it comes to sensitive topics such as criticism or HR decisions, everyone needs to be able to contextualize what’s being said with body language, tone, and mood.

Second, when it comes to complicated issues, it can be difficult to follow along with people’s short, stream-of-consciousness messages while others are replying, reacting with emojis, and so on. Amid the distraction, you may miss important information or be unable to see a connection you’d normally pick out quickly.

- If you _must_ deal with a complicated issue on group chat, have the person raising the issue put all of their ideas and arguments into a document that’s shared with the group before the discussion.

**Generally, group chat should _only_ be used for quick, relatively unimportant matters,** such as asking for confirmation on information or letting someone know you’ve taken care of an issue.

### Trigger #4: Meetings

**All too often, someone trying to escape the discomfort of solving a difficult problem by themselves will organize a meeting, so they can make _other people_ think about the problem for them.** These meetings interrupt employees’ schedules, and attendees who feel stuck in a boring and unproductive echo chamber of ideas around a problem will become distracted.

- For example, they might check social media if they’re bored or go through their emails if they want to feel productive.

**Meetings _can_ create traction, not distraction, if they’re organized in the interest of finding solutions rather than discussing the problem.** There are two parts to this: the _pre-meeting_ and the _meeting_.

#### Pre-Meeting: Adequately Prepare and Brainstorm

Both the meeting organizer and attendees have a pre-meeting responsibility:

- **The meeting organizer** should be required to send out a short agenda to attendees to outline the problem, propose the best solution they’ve thought of, and explain their reasoning. Sometimes, this step eliminates the need for a meeting—either it helps the organizer think through the problem herself or someone solves the problem via email.
- **Attendees:** After reading the meeting agenda, attendees should brainstorm solutions and come to the meeting with prepared ideas. This brainstorming should happen alone or in small groups—large groups tend to repeat the same ideas, but small groups often come up with diverse and innovative ideas.

These two steps make meetings much more productive and efficient—when people think about the problem ahead of time, the meeting can jump right into solutions.

#### Meeting: Cut Out Unnecessary Devices

A common problem in many meetings is that no one is paying attention—they’re checking their phones, sending emails, or doing work on their laptops. **When attendees are only half-listening and half-participating, meetings become inefficient, boring, and unproductive.** Put guidelines in place to minimize device use, such as:

- Asking that attendees take notes with pen and paper rather than on their devices
- Banning device use—put a charging station by the door and require everyone to plug their phone, tablet, or laptop for the duration of the meeting
- Having _one_ person present slides on a projector instead of having everyone follow on their own devices
