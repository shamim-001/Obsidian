#flex-shrink 
- The default value of flex-shrink is 1, which means the flex item can shrink equally with other flex items if necessary.
* if one item has a flex-shrink value of 2 and another item has a flex-shrink value of 1, the first item will shrink twice as much as the second item.
* Zero value: If a flex item has a flex-shrink value of 0, it will not shrink and will maintain its initial size, even if other flex items need to shrink to fit the container.
* Flex-shrink is applied to individual flex items within a flex container
