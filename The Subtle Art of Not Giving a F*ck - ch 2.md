## Chapter 2: Happiness Is Misunderstood

According to Manson, our culture treats happiness as a formula that can be solved. For instance, we may think: If I get a certain thing or do a certain thing, such as marry the right person or live in the right community, I’ll be happy. Or, we treat happiness as something we can earn or acquire.

However, he counters, **happiness isn’t something that you get in return for an achievement** (such as a new job) or something you can find in a “top 10 steps” article from a self-help guru. It’s not something that’s given or that you passively receive, or that is waiting for you somewhere.

Manson says that **happiness comes from solving problems and overcoming challenges**—an activity that improves our lives, creates satisfaction, and is ongoing.

> In _[The Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/1-page-summary)_, Jonathan Haidt argues that we can’t directly create happiness for ourselves. Instead, we should:
> 
> - **Create the right conditions for happiness.** We can’t create happiness, but we can make sure that we’re in a position to be happy. According to Haidt, this primarily means balancing emotional urges with reason; avoiding those impulses that bring fleeting happiness at the cost of lasting damage (drinking, eating junk food, quitting your job without a plan), and giving in to those impulses that will bring long-term satisfaction (building strong relationships, exercising, finding your dream job).
>     
> - **Be patient.** We can’t force happiness—it will come in its own time.
>     
> - **Allow happiness to flourish.** Note the word “allow”; it emphasizes that happiness is something that simply happens, rather than something that we create.
>     
> 
> Haidt’s argument is, in essence, the [Paradox of Hedonism](https://www.utilitarianism.com/paradox.htm) (sometimes called the Paradox of Happiness), which states that pursuing happiness will make you unhappy.

### We’re Hardwired for Unhappiness

Manson claims that **suffering and dissatisfaction are actually part of our biology.** Dissatisfaction and insecurity spurred our ancestors to search out, build, and fight for better living conditions. They are a survival mechanism for advancing our species that is still useful in motivating us to improve our lives. As a result, we will always live with a certain amount of dissatisfaction—**we’re designed to always be dissatisfied with what we have and to want what we don’t have**.

Dissatisfaction in the form of physical or emotional pain tells us what to pay attention to and tells us our limits. It can be healthy or necessary—from it we learn what to do differently in the future. For instance, when we get burned, we learn not to touch a hot stove again. Pain also indicates that something is out of whack, and spurs us to fix it.

(Shortform note: Richard Dawkins’s book _[The Selfish Gene](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-selfish-gene/1-page-summary)_ goes into much greater detail about survival mechanisms (though largely focused on animals, rather than human behaviors). In summary, every trait and behavior that we have exists because the genes for those traits outcompeted other genes and survived to the present day. Thus, as Manson says, our feelings of dissatisfaction and pain—and our responses to those feelings—must have some survival benefit (or did for our ancestors).)

### Problems Are Good for You

We tend to think of problems as something we need to get rid of once and for all in order to be happy. But, Manson argues, problems and challenges are never-ending. **This is actually a good thing, because solving problems leads to satisfaction and improved circumstances.**

For instance, if you address financial hardship by getting a new job, you’re creating new problems for yourself: Needing to travel to and from work, less free time, the stress of keeping your supervisor and management happy, and so on. However, you shouldn’t be overwhelmed by having to solve new problems that pop up—it’s all part of the journey of self-improvement.

Thus, instead of trying to solve all your problems, Manson advises you to strive for _good problems_; problems you can solve, and that you’ll feel good about solving. Good problems and solutions can be straightforward—like fixing poor sleep habits by going to bed sooner—or more complicated, like fixing a relationship by having some difficult conversations. **The important thing is that solving these problems improves your life in some meaningful way.**

> In _[The Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-happiness-hypothesis/chapter-6),_ Jonathan Haidt notes that setbacks and struggles help people to develop mental fortitude, learn new skills, and build stronger support networks, all of which make them happier in the long run.
> 
> In extreme cases, such problems can lead to what psychologists call _[post-traumatic growth](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma)_ _(PTG)_—the opposite of the much better-known _post-traumatic stress_ _disorder_. In PTG, someone who’s suffered through a traumatic event may develop a new appreciation for life, stronger relationships with others, or a newfound confidence. “Finding religion” is also a common expression of PTG.

#### Things That Derail People

Oftentimes, we fail to solve problems just because we get in our own way. Manson says that there are a couple of ways we can block our own progress:

- **Denying problems:** This makes you feel good for a while, but denying reality requires you to distract yourself and repress your true feelings. This makes you anxious and neurotic in the long term.

(Shortform note: Denial is a common [defense mechanism](https://www.simplypsychology.org/defense-mechanisms.html#den)—a way that people subconsciously protect themselves from stress. Common examples might be a smoker who insists that his breathing problems are due to allergies, or an alcoholic who truly believes that his health issues aren’t related to his drinking. Unfortunately, denial is harmful in the long run, since denying problems doesn’t make them go away.)

- **Developing a victim mentality.** To feel good in the short term, you blame others or your circumstances. But in the long term, this makes you feel helpless, depressed, and angry. Blame and denial provide a “high;” you feel morally superior because you believe that you’ve done everything right, and you’re just a victim of circumstances. Self-help experts focus on giving you such highs through exercises that make you feel better temporarily but that don’t address the underlying issue. However, that leads to worse pain later, when you’re forced to confront the real issue.

> In _[The Oz Principle](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-oz-principle),_ Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman use the story _The Wizard of Oz_ to teach two important lessons about the “victim” mindset:
> 
> - Nobody will simply give you what you want
>     
> - You have the power to get it yourself
>     
> 
> In _The Wizard of Oz_, Dorothy and her companions travel to meet the great Wizard seeking magical solutions to their problems. They eventually find out that the Wizard is a fraud; he has no real magic, and can’t give them what they’re looking for (a way home, a brain, a heart, and so on). However, by the end of the book, they realize that they already have what they want—they never needed someone else to give it to them.
> 
> In essence, this is a story about changing your mindset. At first, the characters believed that they were _victims_, trapped by circumstances and needing magical solutions from an external source. However, in the end, they take _accountability_ for their own lives; they realize that what they’re looking for is within them, and not something that anyone else can give them.

### Emotions Are Just a Tool

It’s impossible to be happy all the time, but we still try. Manson argues that we fixate on our emotions because we misunderstand their function, so we allow them to lead us in the wrong direction.

**The purpose of emotions is to give you feedback**, telling you that something is good or bad for you. Emotions point you toward useful change, but they aren’t a worthwhile goal in and of themselves.

- **Negative emotions are a signal to take action**.
    - For instance, feeling sad when you’re alone teaches you not to do the things that led to you being alone in the first place.
- **Positive emotions are a reward for doing the right thing**.
    - For example, feeling energized and confident after a workout encourages you to continue exercising.

> The _[emotional intelligence](http://www.theeiinstitute.com/what-is-emotional-intelligence/4-mayer-and-salovey-model-of-emotional-intelligence.html)_ model is a theory of psychology that attempts to describe how an “average” person develops emotionally throughout his or her life. It provides benchmarks for measuring a patient’s development (similar to how IQ measures cognitive ability).
> 
> **The emotional intelligence model focuses on four things:**
> 
> - Accurately identifying emotions in yourself and others
>     
> - Using emotions to aid thought processes (This is what Manson is referring to when he talks about using your emotions as feedback.)
>     
> - Analyzing and understanding emotions; your own and other people’s
>     
> - Managing your emotions to achieve specific goals
>     
> 
> A lot of what Manson says in _Subtle Art_ is about managing your emotions, rather than letting your emotions manage you. That’s why he warns against unrestrained pleasure-seeking, or simply trying to “feel good.” The emotional intelligence model can give you some benchmarks for how well you’re following Manson’s advice.

#### How We Mishandle Emotions

Here’s where Manson believes people go wrong in handling their emotions:

**1. They make decisions based on emotion, without applying reason, or use their emotions to justify their actions.** For example, “I know I keyed your car, but I was really mad and couldn’t help it.” Or, “I quit my job and started painting because it _felt right._” Emotions are part of life, but not the only important part of it.

(Shortform note: Psychologists note that [emotions do provide us with important information;](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intense-emotions-and-strong-feelings/201012/it-or-not-emotions-will-drive-the-decisions-you) for example, when an aggressive person makes you angry or nervous, it’s your emotions warning you to protect yourself. Problems arise when, as Manson says, when we base all of our decisions _solely_ on emotion—for while emotions are useful for quick insights into a situation, they’re very imprecise. For example, that aggressive person making you nervous might not be an actual threat, but just someone who reminds you a bit too much of an ex.)

**2. They fixate on their emotions.** This leads to failure because emotions are fleeting: What makes us happy today won’t do so tomorrow, because our biology drives us to keep seeking further satisfaction. Fixating on feeling good or happy drives us to constantly pursue a holy grail, which we don’t reach; not reaching it makes us feel inadequate. Psychologists call this the “**hedonic treadmill**”: Even though we work hard to change something in our lives, we end up feeling the same. Further, **everything positive comes with a built-in negative or a sacrifice.** The thing that initially makes us feel good also has a negative side. For instance, the person we marry is also the one we fight with. The job we sought becomes a source of stress.

> **What Is Hedonism?**
> 
> _[Hedonism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hedonism)_ (from which we get the “hedonic treadmill” referenced above) usually means pleasure-seeking and self-indulgence at the expense of everything else. This common definition carries negative connotations, since it usually implies selfishness and greed.
> 
> However, hedonism may also refer to the [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/) that pain and pleasure motivate everything that people do; in other words, that **we’re driven entirely by our emotions.** That makes hedonism effectively the opposite of the Stoic-inspired philosophy that Manson promotes in _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_, which advocates instead for a more rational approach to our desires.
> 
> In the present day, the field of philosophy recognizes and respects both schools of thought; there’s no common consensus over which one is correct, or whether the truth is somewhere in between them.

**3. They repress their emotions**. Many people are taught to repress emotions, but by doing that you block feedback that could help you solve your problems, and you will continue to struggle with unsolved problems. (Remember, you can’t be happy if you can’t solve problems.)

(Shortform note: Like denial, repression is a common [psychological defense mechanism](https://www.simplypsychology.org/defense-mechanisms.html#rep). Rather than facing difficult problems or uncomfortable thoughts, people force them down into their subconscious. In addition to preventing themselves from solving those problems, as Manson notes, this can cause people to develop anxiety and other mental health issues as a result of repressed thoughts and feelings.)

### Struggle Is Part of Happiness

Most people can easily answer the question, “What do you want from life?” In Manson’s experience, they mostly say the same things: They want a happy, carefree life, and to have all the things they desire.

But, because true happiness grows from solving problems and overcoming challenges, it requires struggle. Therefore, Manson argues that the better question in determining happiness is: **What are you willing to struggle for, and how much pain are you willing to endure?** Your answer to _that_ question determines how your life turns out.

> **Mike Tyson’s Daily Struggle**
> 
> Often, choosing to struggle once is not enough; in order to thrive, you have to continually recommit to your meaningful struggle.
> 
> Mike Tyson is known as one of the greatest boxers of all time—in his prime, he boasted punching power that few people in history could equal, and skills to match. However, Tyson only became the dominant force that he was **because he was willing to go through immense pain and struggle on a daily basis.**
> 
> According to one article, [Tyson’s daily routine](https://www.sportscasting.com/mike-tysons-daily-training-routine-was-insane-even-by-his-standards/) went something like this:
> 
> - Wake up at 5 A.M.
>     
> - 3-mile run
>     
> - Breakfast
>     
> - 10 rounds sparring
>     
> - Lunch
>     
> - More sparring (amount not specified)
>     
> - 2,000 squats
>     
> - 2,500 situps
>     
> - 500 elbow dips
>     
> - 500 push-ups
>     
> - 500 shoulder shrugs (holding a 66lb barbell)
>     
> - Dinner
>     
> - Exercise bike
>     
> - Bed at 10 P.M.
>     
> 
> This routine is more than most people would subject themselves to even once, let alone every day. Tyson’s willingness to suffer through it over and over again is what made him into a champion boxer.
