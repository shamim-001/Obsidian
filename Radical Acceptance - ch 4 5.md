## Chapters 4-5: Questioning and Welcoming

In these two chapters we’ll look at specific challenges we all face in life, and how we can apply Radical Acceptance to overcome them.

We begin Chapter 4 with another story of the Buddha and the god Mara, which illustrates how we can practice Radical Acceptance as a friendly conversation with ourselves.

In Chapter 5, we recognize that every mental and emotional experience has a physical impact—and, therefore, what’s happening inside our bodies is an excellent place to begin our friendly questioning. We also discuss how trauma can cut us off from those physical sensations, and possible ways to reconnect with ourselves.

### Friendly Questioning

**The core of Radical Acceptance is the friendly question.** Imagine that you’re talking to a friend about how her day went. You’re not looking to pass judgment or make any changes, you’re just curious and looking for insight. A powerful example of this is seen in the following anecdote.

There was a clinical psychologist and practicing Buddhist, whom we’ll call Jacob. Jacob was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease when he went to give a talk on Buddhism to an audience of over 100 people. He got up on stage and suddenly realized that he had no idea where he was or why. Jacob began to panic.

Rather than being ruled by his feelings, Jacob practiced a mindfulness technique. He turned his attention inward, and began naming his experiences aloud: fear, embarrassment, confusion, and so on. As the exercise took effect and he started calming down, he shared that experience too. Finally, after several minutes, he returned his attention to his audience.

Many of the people there were deeply moved. Jacob’s meditation had been both a practical lesson about mindfulness and a powerful insight into Alzheimer’s Disease.

The exercise worked because Jacob embraced his experience with open curiosity and acceptance. He didn’t try to fight against his fear and confusion, because they weren’t something to be fought; they were simply his reality at that moment. **Jacob didn’t create an enemy where there wasn’t one.**

Another story of the Buddha has a similar lesson. The god Mara didn’t give up after their fateful encounter at the bodhi tree. He returned multiple times throughout the Buddha’s life to attack him or try to sway him from his enlightenment.

Each time Mara appeared, the Buddha acknowledged his presence with a simple, “I see you, Mara.” Rather than trying to block Mara out or drive him away, the Buddha would invite him in for tea. Eventually Mara would leave on his own, powerless as always against the Buddha’s acceptance and kindness.

#### Welcoming Mara

All of us will have our own visits from Mara throughout our lives. These visits may come in the form of difficult emotions like anger and fear, or in the form of the stories we tell ourselves. Every time we tell ourselves that we’re not good enough, doomed to unhappiness, an embarrassment, or whatever judgments we pass on ourselves, that could be seen as a visit from Mara.

Like the Buddha, and like Jacob, we can meet these experiences with unconditional friendliness. Sometimes we’ll catch ourselves lashing out at those around us, or stewing in frustration over every little problem. That’s a chance to name our experiences like Jacob did, and invite them in for tea like the Buddha did.

**By naming our hardships, we rob them of some of their power.** Approach this with a spirit of friendly questioning; you’re not seeking to judge, only to understand. For example, you might ask yourself if you’re _really_ so angry because there’s a fly in your office, or if you’re stressed about your work and worried that you’re falling behind. Finding and recognizing what we’re actually experiencing is how we say, “I see you, Mara.”

Once we understand what’s happening to us, the next step is to welcome it. In the spirit of Radical Acceptance, we can say “yes” to our experiences, no matter what they may be. Say “yes” to the frustration, to the sadness, to the desire. Love yourself and all of your experiences. In other words, greet Mara as an old friend and invite him in for tea. By welcoming the experiences in this way, we allow them to pass through us without gaining power over us.

While Radical Acceptance begins with saying yes to our moment-to-moment experiences, it doesn’t have to end there. We can learn to say yes to the entire life we’re living, whatever that life looks like at the moment. We can say yes to our appearance, our personality, our friendships, and our secular and spiritual work, all at once.

This is an important practice in a culture that encourages us to aim for perfection. That unattainable goal means that, when we take a step back to examine our lives, we often feel like things aren’t working out quite the way they should be. That’s when Mara pays a visit, and we have another opportunity for friendly questioning and Radical Acceptance.

Perhaps, if your life isn’t “right,” the question could be, “Right compared to what?” What standard are you setting, and is it even attainable? Why should that be necessary for happiness? **Rather than fighting against your own story of what life _should be,_ invite your current messy, imperfect life to sit with you and have a cup of tea.**

### Mindfulness of the Body

**The body is a good place to begin this friendly questioning.** We experience life through our bodies, yet are often so wrapped up in our thoughts that we miss out on a lot of it. Some people have described the experience as only being alive from the neck up; so busy with thoughts and worries that they aren’t fully aware of their bodies.

Even when we’re aware of a strong physical sensation, like a cool breeze or the sound of rain, we’re almost never fully present in the moment; we have an inner monologue running over it. When we hug a friend, are we fully appreciating the hug? Or are we thinking about how long to hold it, and what to say after letting go? The Buddha called this constant torrent of thoughts the _waterfall_, a strong current that carries us away from the moment.

**The waterfall happens because our minds instantly and unconsciously judge everything we experience as either pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant.** However, what it’s actually judging are the physical sensations, the sensory input it’s getting from the body. The smell of cookies or the feeling of a soft blanket on the skin is pleasant, and the brain wants to pursue it. A sudden, loud noise is unpleasant, and the brain wants to escape or defend against it. Something neutral, like an empty space on a wall, usually drives us to direct our attention somewhere else, looking for something more stimulating.

To escape the waterfall, the Buddha recommended centering your mindfulness on your body. Physical sensations are the beginnings of thoughts and feelings. The trick is to recognize those thoughts and feelings as they arise, and then let them go; keep returning to the immediate physical experience.

Remember the habit of friendly questioning. **When you’re focused on physical experiences, don’t ask yourself how _you_ feel; instead, ask how your _body_ feels.** Are there areas of tension or pain? Is there an especially pleasant sensation you’re feeling, like the comfort of a soft cushion or a gentle breeze? Are you fully present in your body, or do parts of you feel cut off from the whole? Do you really _feel_ your hand, for example, or are you merely _aware_ of it? These are a few examples of questions you can use to check in with your current physical experience.

It can be difficult, especially in modern cultures, to let go of the constant flow of thoughts. **We’re trained from childhood to be vigilant and reactive; we attempt to monitor and control everything.** A student participating in a meditation retreat once said that letting go of thoughts and being mindful of sensations made him anxious. He felt like he was going to miss important things, or a sudden situation would catch him unprepared.

#### Fear and Trauma Block Off the Body

**Pain, while unpleasant, serves an important purpose.** It warns us that there’s some kind of danger, and that we should take appropriate steps to avoid injury. If we’re touching something hot, we pull away; if we’re already hurt, we rest to avoid hurting ourselves more.

However, pain often triggers a harmful fear response as well. It comes with the internal narrative that _something is wrong_—something more than just the immediate danger. As we discussed earlier, the story that “something is wrong” frequently turns into “something is wrong with me.” In Western cultures especially, pain is regarded as something bad or wrong, something to be avoided if possible and destroyed if not. That’s why we take painkillers for everything from headaches to colds, shooting the messenger instead of listening to what it’s telling us.

All too often, people experiencing pain will compound their own suffering with stories about how it’s their own fault that they’re hurting—that they didn’t take care of themselves properly, or that they did something foolish and injured themselves. They may worry that the pain won’t ever stop, or that they’ll never be the same again. Even in those unfortunate circumstances where pain does signal something permanently wrong, they might worsen their own situation by conflating “never being the same again” with “never being happy again.” **It’s easy to see how the waterfall sweeps us away from the physical experience of the moment—pain—and into something far worse.**

For people who have suffered serious trauma, the effect is even more extreme. Many of them will dissociate from their physical bodies completely, experiencing their own lives as if watching somebody else. It’s a defense mechanism, yet one that just causes more suffering in the long run. Like the man running from his own shadow, the trauma doesn’t go away just because we ignore it. Sooner or later we have to either face it, or run ourselves to death trying to get away.

**Pain isn’t good or evil, it’s just information.** However, the fear and trauma that often come with pain take us outside of our own bodies, away from our physical experiences.

Reconnecting with ourselves can be difficult. It requires recognizing and welcoming things we’d prefer to avoid: inviting Mara in for tea, so to speak. It takes patience, meditation, and Radical Acceptance. In serious cases, it can require the help of a teacher or a therapist.

However, once we’re fully connected and accepting of our experiences, we can face each moment as it comes. We can accept each moment’s pleasures and pains without being swept away in thoughts and the stories we tell ourselves. Life will seem richer and more vibrant, because we’ll once again be living it fully, rather than only being alive “from the neck up.”
