## Chapters 16, 18, 21: Psychological Hurdles to Success

While being obsessed with success and going all in drive you toward your goals, there are three common attitudes and behaviors that can derail you if you don’t reject them: fear of risk, fear of criticism, and making excuses.

### 1) Fear of Risk

When taking extreme action, you’ll experience fear because you’re going out on a limb by yourself. Everyone fears things in life; the key is what you do with fear. Rather than let it sap your confidence and momentum, use it to spur you toward your goals.

Fear is beneficial because:

- **Fear is an indication you’re on the right track**: you’re taking the right actions in the right amounts. You’re pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. (Not pushing yourself beyond what’s comfortable only gets you more of the same.)
- **Fear is a motivator**: Most of what you fear doesn’t happen. Instead of avoiding fear, use it to motivate yourself to act. If you’re afraid to call on a particular client, or raise a concern with your boss, do it. If you fear requesting a client’s business, persist in asking for it. The actions you fear often will give you the greatest return.
- **Fear helps you grow**: Embrace fear because it enables you to do new things and grow. The more you act despite fear, the more confident you’ll become in doing new things. Push yourself past fear; then push yourself until you're afraid again, act again, and so on. By continually overcoming fears, you can build an extraordinary life. Turn fear into fuel.

#### An Important Fact About Fear

**The more time you give fear to build up, the stronger it becomes**. The more time you spend thinking about and imagining what can go wrong in a situation, the more apprehensive you become.

Many people use one of the following excuses to delay acting when they’re afraid:

- They tell themselves they need more time prepare, or
- They tell themselves, “This isn’t a good time.”

Either of these just gives the fear more time to build. Instead, **immediately do the thing you’re apprehensive about. The _only_ thing that will banish fear is action**.

### 2) Fear of Criticism

Like fear, criticism is another sign you’re headed in the right direction. It’s a common result of the attention you get from becoming successful or taking extreme efforts.

You’ll be judged by those who feel threatened by your success (they believe the supply of success is limited), those who feel inadequate because they’re taking minimal action, or those who are simply envious. **Sometimes, people deliver criticism in the form of advice**: they tell you you should take more time off, stop working so hard, or stop going all out for certain clients who aren’t worth it.

But if you back off due to criticism, you’ll only shortchange yourself. Remember, success isn’t about being popular, it’s your duty. Further, when you keep working at 10X levels, your critics may come to admire you. In any case, the best response to criticism is 10X success.

### 3) Making Excuses

Everyone uses excuses—we all have favorites we use repeatedly. Many people reading this book are making excuses at this point for not adopting the 10X Rule.

Excuses are reasons you come up with justifying what you do or don’t do. Popular excuses include:

- I don’t have the money.
- I have kids.
- I’m married/not married.
- I’m overworked.
- I don’t have time to take classes.
- I have a terrible boss.
- The economy is bad.

But excuses aren’t the real reasons motivating what you do; they’re a rewrite of the facts to make you feel better later. For example, you might blame traffic for making you late to work. But the real reason you’re late is not planning your time so you can leave home earlier and avoid traffic.

You can’t create change or improve any situation until you acknowledge the real reason for your actions or inactions. When you make excuses you’re refusing to take responsibility for your life (as discussed in Chapter 6).

#### Give Up Excuses

No excuse will ever make you more successful. In fact, when you excuse something you did or didn’t do, you create an opportunity for someone else to find a solution instead of you.

If you believe success is your duty rather than an option, you must commit yourself and your business to never making excuses for anything.
