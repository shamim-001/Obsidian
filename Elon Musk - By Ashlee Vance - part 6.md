## Part 6: Musk’s Management Style and Methods

Now that we understand Musk’s motivations and traits, we’ll discuss some of the common methods he used that helped his companies succeed. Through a combination of hiring exceptional employees, maintaining control of his companies, organizing cross-functional teams, and setting extreme deadlines, Musk’s businesses have achieved impressive results.

### Exceptional Employees

Vance believes much of Musk’s success stems from his ability to find and hire exceptional people. He has an eye for talent, and he appreciates people who are hard workers and critical thinkers. These employees are also efficient, and they can do the work of multiple people. When every employee is doing exceptional work, the combination of their efforts results in something exceptional as well.

Musk handled a majority of the recruiting and hiring for all of his companies, and he found many talented employees.

- Many of the engineers from X.com and PayPal went on to create start-ups like YouTube, Palantir Technologies, and Yelp.
- Musk recruited Gwynne Shotwell for SpaceX. Vance notes that she is as dedicated to going to space as Musk is. She is now the president and chief operating officer of SpaceX.
- For Tesla, Musk recognized the ideas and talents of Straubel, Eberhard, and Tarpenning, and he paired them together to speed up the process of developing an exceptional electric car.

However, Vance explains that these exceptional employees must also be willing to remain in the background of the operations and allow Musk to have the limelight. Tom Mueller, one of the engineers at SpaceX, has proven this. He helped Musk develop the plan for the initial SpaceX rocket, opening up the possibility of building a new rocket at a lower cost. Mueller remained at SpaceX, but he doesn’t publicly take much credit for his part in SpaceX’s rocket development.

> **Overworking and Injuring Employees**
> 
> While Musk values star players like Shotwell and Mueller for their efficiency and hard work, he may have a [tendency to overwork—and even injure—these exceptional employees](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk). According to incident reports, Tesla called for ambulances over 100 times between 2014 and 2017 for reasons such as dizziness, seizures, abnormal breathing, and other injuries. One technician noted that sometimes when someone got hurt on the job, another employee was sent to work around that person while they were still injured on the floor.
> 
> In October 2016, Tesla reduced the time of their average workday since employees were putting in 12-hour days, six days a week. Tesla reported that the change caused a 50% decline in overtime hours. This may also help the long-term effects of working long periods of time in uncomfortable positions, which have caused arm and chest pain for some employees. Musk said he put his office in the most uncomfortable place, slept in the office, and put in more hours than his employees to show that he was working just as hard as they were.

#### Accountable Employees

Musk expects employees to be accountable for their work by taking complete ownership of their specialty and project as well as the process required to complete it—Vance contends he wants each employee to be the CEO of her own project. Musk’s employees work as an independent unit, completing their work fully and to the best of their ability.

When every employee takes accountability for their work, it eliminates inefficiencies like asking for permission, filling out forms, or waiting for requests to be processed or approved. At SpaceX and Tesla, this approach allows employees to act independently and in the best interest of the company.

Vance explains how Musk often talks to employees about a project and asks them, “Can you do it?” This forces employees to take responsibility for their work because they willingly agree to do it, rather than completing tasks they were ordered to do.

If an employee is developing a rearview mirror or coding a new command, Musk expects her to put her full attention and effort into the task. And whenever developments are delayed, Musk is known to ask for regular updates about the status of the hold-up, why the task is taking longer than anticipated, and what’s required for the employee to complete the project. Employees eventually realized that they should come to Musk with potential solutions to problems, rather than coming to him with problems. This is a more efficient process, and it allows Musk to focus on other tasks, rather than walking employees through problems they’re qualified to solve.

> **Lack of Behavioral Accountability**
> 
> While Musk encourages his employees to be accountable for their actions, this accountability seems only to extend to work-related tasks, not to good workplace behavior. Musk’s companies have allegations of sexist and racist work environments, indicating employees are not held accountable for disrespectful and harmful comments and actions.
> 
> SpaceX employees have reported [instances of sexual harassment at work](https://www.theverge.com/22831380/spacex-employees-harassment-workplace-misconduct-elon-musk) and note that the company hasn’t done anything about the problem. Some employees felt SpaceX’s lack of action was motivated by management’s desire to avoid work disruptions.
> 
> Additionally, reports reveal instances of [discrimination, racist graffiti, and Tesla employees—including supervisors—using racial slurs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/technology/tesla-racial-discrimination-california-suit.html). An investigation into Tesla’s work environment also found that black workers are given more physically demanding jobs.
> 
> But research has shown that [discrimination in the workplace actually makes employees less productive](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170213131343.htm), indicating all kinds of accountability—both task- and behavior-based—are important.

### Retain Control of Companies

After his experience at Zip2 and PayPal, Musk valued maintaining control of his companies. He knows leadership positions give him the most influence, allowing him to run his business how he wants to.

Vance explains that Musk doesn’t have a desire for totalitarian control. Instead, he’s concerned about making sure things get done correctly. Musk believes there are certain things that need to be done to achieve his vision, and he thinks he’s the best one to make sure those things happen. This tactic has helped Tesla and SpaceX succeed, since Musk has the vision and drive to effectively lead and make business decisions.

Musk kept control of Tesla and SpaceX by being the largest shareholder and being CEO. While Tesla’s precarious financial situation forced it to go public, Musk resisted making SpaceX a public company. Vance notes that he didn’t like how short sellers messed with Tesla’s stock or how Tesla’s financial statements were available for scrutiny. Musk wanted to retain control of SpaceX and to avoid the volatility of going public.

> **The Right Leader for a Just Cause**
> 
> Musk has retained control as CEO of his companies because he believes he is the best one to move his businesses toward his goals—to keep the companies playing in the infinite game, where players play to keep playing, not to win. In _[The Infinite Game](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-infinite-game/1-page-summary)_, Simon Sinek explains that if your CEO doesn’t have an infinite mindset, she’s not going to lead your company through its infinite game properly. Choosing who to lead an organization can be the difference between long-term survival or failure. Unfortunately, finding the right leader can be difficult.
> 
> Like Musk, your [CEO needs an infinite mindset to lead your company through its infinite game](https://shortform.com/app/book/the-infinite-game/guideline-1#a-just-cause-requires-the-right-leader). An infinite-minded company needs someone who can look beyond her organization and envision where the company will head next; she must be more of a “CVO” (Chief Vision Officer) than a CEO. Other executives—Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and so on—have the luxury of being finite-minded, since they are tasked with dealing with specific issues within their departments. But the CEO does not have that luxury; she needs to be able to focus on the company’s Just Cause—their overarching mission—above all else.
> 
> The different visionary requirements of a CEO as compared to other executives can lead to problems when a CEO steps down and one of those other executives takes her place. Sometimes, a person who functioned excellently in a more finite role has difficulty adjusting to the infinite mindset needed for the top position, and they lose sight of their Just Cause. It seems that Musk doesn’t want to take the chance of a new CEO not having an infinite mindset for Tesla or SpaceX.

### Cross-Functional Teams

Musk uses a cross-functional approach to his businesses in which employees from different departments and with different skills work together on a project or goal. This allows the teams to come up with better, more inventive solutions using employees’ expertise.

Vance discusses how Musk’s approach is different from other manufacturers, who wait weeks for another department to hear about and fix problems. Musk has engineers and technicians work together to complete tasks. When testing Tesla’s cars for weather and temperature performance, software engineers and technicians were there to make software changes on the spot. Other manufacturers sent the test data back to the offices where employees would analyze results, make changes, and go back later for more rounds of testing. Musk’s tactic maximizes efficiency and technological improvements.

(Shortform note: Musk’s companies benefited from having his teams work toward a common goal, which supports experts’ claims that [cross-functional teams](https://www.corestrengths.com/cross-functional-collaboration-benefits/) perform better, resolve conflicts, effectively engage employees, and cause employees to feel more appreciated. Other benefits include a more collaborative work culture, opportunities to learn leadership skills, and improved insight and innovation when solving problems.)

Musk’s cross-functional approach is even reflected in the design of the SpaceX facility. Offices for engineers are located in the middle of the factory, forcing engineers to walk through the factory floor and talk with technicians. The walls of the office are glass, so engineers can see the work that technicians do. Vance believes this design creates a collaborative atmosphere, rather than making departments separate from each other. All departments work together toward a common goal.

> **The Panopticon of SpaceX**
> 
> SpaceX’s facility design is reminiscent of a [panopticon, which is a famous architectural design for prisons](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/courses/13things/7121.html). Traditionally, a watch tower is placed in the center of the prison so guards can monitor all prisoners, intended to maximize control and intimidation—not collaboration.
> 
> But unlike a traditional panopticon, where prisoners aren’t sure whether or not guards are watching them (so the fear of being watched keeps them in check) SpaceX offices highlight to both engineers and technicians that they are being watched, thus placing every employee in the position of both prisoner and guard. Some experts question the benefits of these layouts, noting that [open office spaces decrease face-to-face interactions by 70%](https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices), indicating that collaboration actually decreases when offices are made less private.

### Vertical Integration

Vance explains how Musk used vertical integration for his businesses. This is when a company controls as much of its production and supply chain as possible, rather than outsourcing labor from a different country or buying parts from another company. If a part was too expensive, Musk wanted employees to create a newer, better part that cost less to make. As a result, SpaceX produces almost 90% of its parts and electronics for its rockets.

Vertical integration benefitted Musk’s companies in several ways:

1) It kept costs down. Musk cut down the costs of his companies by finding ways to produce parts for cheaper than the average market price. For example, Tesla needed to test how its cars would respond to cold temperatures. Most car companies would pay for a special cooling chamber for testing. Instead of paying the high cost for one of these chambers, Tesla developed its own chamber, using an ice cream truck and a large cooled trailer. This was a cheaper method than buying one of the special cooling chambers.

2) It improved existing technologies. Both Tesla and SpaceX succeeded by creating new technologies to solve problems that arose while creating the rocket and electric car. Since they were figuring out how to make new parts and technologies anyway, Musk’s teams took the opportunity to improve the parts. They found that different metals or changing the software could improve the performance of the part and, by extension, the product as a whole.

3) It increased efficiency. By making everything in-house, Musk’s companies could speed up their manufacturing process. If anything went wrong, they could replace or fix a part much quicker than waiting for a new one to be shipped in.

> **Pros and Cons of Vertical Integration**
> 
> Vance notes that Musk’s companies benefited from [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp#toc-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-vertical-integration) by keeping costs down, improving technologies, and increasing efficiency, but experts note a few other advantages of this kind of production process. Vertical integration also allows companies to avoid quality issues, since they can address problems directly, rather than working with another company to fix the issue and send them a new part. Additionally, businesses who control more of their production process are often more profitable.
> 
> However, vertical integration has disadvantages. The initial cost and effort of setting up your own supply chain are significant, which may result in acquiring more debt. And sometimes, it’s a good idea to outsource to a reputable company with a good product or service.
> 
> While there isn’t a right or wrong answer as to whether vertical integration is right for your business, you should weigh the pros and cons and determine what’s best for your company and your goals. For Musk’s goal of building a cheaper rocket with SpaceX, he saw vertical integration as necessary for reducing the overall cost of a rocket.

### Ambitious Deadlines

In all of his companies, Musk set ambitious deadlines for both himself and others. He told employees, consumers, and executives that certain tasks or products would be completed faster than anyone thought possible. Vance believes he wasn’t setting an arbitrary timeline—this was genuinely how long Musk believed it would take to complete certain tasks.

Employees soon understood that if Musk said something would take a day, it would actually take a few days or a week to do. They also learned to create daily—and sometimes hourly—schedules that included bathroom breaks. Employees understood the consequences of not meeting these deadlines.

Although setting these extreme deadlines put a lot of pressure on Musk and his employees, this habit is a large part of Musk’s success. Musk rarely met these deadlines, but by creating an extremely ambitious schedule, his teams achieved impressive results in a faster time frame than anyone else thought possible. For instance, NASA took about a decade to build a satellite; Musk’s original goal was to launch a rocket into space in a year and a half. Given NASA’s timeframe, Musk’s deadline seemed impossible. It took SpaceX six years to successfully launch the rocket. While SpaceX didn’t meet the original goal, completing the rocket in six years was still faster than anyone in the industry had predicted.

> **Use Parkinson’s Law and Ingvar’s Rule for Deadline Setting**
> 
> While Musk uses ambitious deadlines to achieve results, [experts debate their effectiveness and whether they’re worth the stress](https://shortform.com/app/book/eat-that-frog/chapter-4#deadlines-and-the-law-of-forced-efficiency). Many people say they work better under deadline pressure, but research indicates the opposite. Under deadline pressure, people feel stressed, make mistakes, and have to redo work, which ends up taking more time. Often the mistakes—such as product flaws and cost overruns—have long-term financial consequences.
> 
> Instead, try using [Parkinson’s Law](https://personalmba.com/parkinsons-law/) the next time you need to set a deadline. Parkinson’s Law states that work expands to fulfill the time available for its completion. So if something must be done in six months, it will take six months. Create a plan based off of that deadline, and make choices and tradeoffs to accomplish it. While experts believe Parkinson’s Law shouldn’t be used to create overly-ambitious deadlines, it _can_ be used as a thought experiment to explore how long it might _actually_ take to complete a project. Consider what it would look like to cut your deadline in half. What would it take to complete it by then? Alternatively, what could you accomplish with an extended deadline?
> 
> For accounting for smaller tasks like meetings or even bathroom breaks, consider using [Ingvar’s Rule, or the 10-minute Rule](https://www.ideatovalue.com/insp/nickskillicorn/2021/02/the-10-minute-rule-from-the-founder-of-ikea/), which assumes that a task needs to take no more than 10 minutes. Many people default to an hour for these types of activities, but 10 minutes is often enough time.
