## Shortform Introduction

In _The Book of Five Rings_, legendary Samurai Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645) shares his principles for aspiring warriors wishing to learn the true Way for success in combat. For Musashi, the essence of the Way is _strategy_: how a warrior trains himself mentally and physically for mortal combat, his skill in wielding any kind of weapon, and his ability to adapt to any kind of circumstances in order to achieve his victory. **Above all else, Musashi argues that success in combat is about discipline and strategy, _not_ innate talent.** Modern readers can apply Musashi’s principles to personal and professional contexts, allowing them to develop the habits and mindset necessary for achieving their goals.

### About the Author

**Miyamoto Musashi** was born in the Harima Province of Japan in 1584, the son of a swordsman. Musashi fought and won his first duel at age 13. At age 16 he embarked on his personal _musha shugyō,_ the traditional rite-of-passage for Samurai in which the aspiring warrior traveled throughout Japan, fighting duels and learning more about his craft. Afterward, Musashi took up residence at a Buddhist temple while continuing to hone his skills in swordsmanship. In 1612, Musashi fought one of his most famous duels against another leading Samurai, Sasaki Kojirō, whom he killed.

In later years, Musashi ran his own school for training aspiring Samurai. A couple of years before his death, Musashi recorded his key principles of swordsmanship in his _Book of Five Rings_. He also later completed a short book called _[The Way of Walking Alone](https://www.stickmanpublications.com/books/musashis-dokkodo/)_. Apart from his legendary status as a swordsman, Musashi was also known as an accomplished calligrapher and painter. He died in 1645, after having spent his final years mostly in seclusion. In the centuries since his death, Musashi’s life has inspired numerous films, novels, and television series—a testament to his lasting impact in Japanese popular culture.

### The Book’s Publication

_The Book of Five Rings_ was written in Japanese around 1643, and it now exists in multiple modern English translations. Due to the book’s linguistic and historical challenges, producing a definitive translation can be tricky. Musashi’s writing style can be vague even at the best of times; the fact he is writing in centuries-old Japanese about a martial arts tradition deeply embedded in his 17th-century culture adds to the possible difficulties of interpretation.

The first mainstream English publication featured a translation by Victor Harris and was published by Overlook Press in 1974. [The book was marketed as particularly useful for businessmen seeking to understand strategy in a modern competitive context](http://www.musashimiyamoto.com/five%20rings/translations.html). A later [translation by Thomas Cleary](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/643352/the-book-of-five-rings-by-miyamoto-musashi-translated-by-thomas-cleary/#) sought to contextualize Musashi’s thinking within its spiritual and historical context. Cleary’s interest in the culture of the Samurai is also displayed in his translation of [a book of strategy by another Samurai, Taira Shigesuke](https://www.tuttlepublishing.com/japan/code-of-the-samurai), and his numerous translations of other works related to martial arts.

Our guide uses the Kindle edition of the translation by William Scott Wilson. Wilson’s translation is fairly terse and functional, and it seems to aim for clarity over style. Readers who wish to learn more about other Samurai manuals of instruction, the Samurai tradition itself, or Miyamoto Musashi can consult our “further reading” list at the end of this guide.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

The Samurai were an elite caste of warriors in Japan with a military tradition that endured for several centuries. The Samurai first came to prominence during the Kamakura Period (1185-1333) and lasted until their official dissolution in 1879, when Japan began to favor modernization in its military. Although trained as warriors, many prominent Samurai dynasties also became involved in politics, with members of Samurai clans holding important civil positions within the Imperial government.

The values of the Samurai were largely influenced by different strains of Eastern philosophy, such as Buddhism and Confucianism. The ideal Samurai had to be brave, calm, highly skilled with his weapons, and fiercely loyal to his Lord or Emperor. A true Samurai who had failed in combat or behaved dishonorably would commit _seppuku_, a ritual suicide. Oftentimes, shortly before the _seppuku_, the Samurai would compose a short “death poem” as a formal leave-taking of the world.

While no longer an active force in the modern world, the Samurai remain historically and culturally important in the Japanese popular consciousness. There are many novels, films, and other forms of media inspired by the Samurai, and the traditional art of swordsmanship is still practiced today in some martial arts schools.

#### Intellectual Context

##### Samurai Manuals of Instruction

Although perhaps the most famous Samurai of his day, Musashi is not the only Samurai to have left behind a written account of his strategies. Some other famous Samurai whose works have been translated into English include Taira Shigesuke, Yamamoto Kansuke, and Natori-Ryu (see our “further reading” list at the end of this guide for details). When Musashi discusses rival schools of instruction in the Book of Wind, a chapter in _The Book of Five Rings_, it is important to keep his contemporary context in mind: Musashi was not the only Samurai offering an interpretation of the Way, and opinions did differ in terms of approach and technique among different Samurai. In assessing these rival schools and offering his own strategies for aspiring warriors, Musashi was contributing to important debates and rivalries active in his time.

Musashi left another text before his death, _[The Way of Walking Alone](https://www.stickmanpublications.com/books/musashis-dokkodo/)_, which is a meditation on self-reliance. It contains [21 general principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokk%C5%8Dd%C5%8D) that Musashi believes are key to having a successful and peaceful life.

##### The Tradition of Manuals of Instruction

Manuals of instruction have long existed as a genre in both the West and East, and they can address an almost limitless number of topics. As noted above, many manuals of instruction by other Samurai exist. Within a broader Eastern historical context, the Chinese _[The Art of War](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-art-of-war)_ by Sun Tzu is a useful point of comparison to _The Book of Five Rings_. It is an earlier example (5th century AD) of strategy offered for forms of combat. However, Tzu focuses on strategies for armies, as opposed to focusing on individual combat as Musashi tends to do.

Within the Western tradition, a manual of instruction that exhibits a similar sort of spirit to _The Book of Five Rings_ is Niccolò Machiavelli’s _[The Prince](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/niccolo-machiavelli/the-prince/w-k-marriott)_, which was written in around 1510 and first published in 1532—approximately a century before _The Book of Five Rings_ was written_._ While Musashi seeks to create the perfect warrior, Machiavelli offers advice for becoming the perfect politician. Like Musashi, Machiavelli is not concerned with conventional morality—an aspect of _The Prince_ that has become somewhat infamous, both during Machiavelli’s own time and in the centuries since. What Musashi and Machiavelli share in common above all else is a total commitment to victory: Both writers argue that a man must be ruthlessly disciplined in achieving his goal and willing to succeed at any cost.

#### The Book’s Impact

_The Book of Five Rings_ has found popularity outside of martial arts contexts in two general respects: as a guide to strategy that can be applied to a modern business context, and as principles that can be applied to an individual’s personal goals or interests more generally.

##### Application to Business

As mentioned above, when an English translation of _The Book of Five Rings_ first appeared in 1974, it was marketed as a guide for businesspeople. This helped to popularize the book with Western readers, [especially in the wake of Japan’s economic boom in the 1980s](http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/Bushido/gorin-no-sho.htm). Nowadays, the book’s relevance for modern business is sometimes questioned by some readers and commentators; however, this guide notes principles that may be useful for a reader’s professional life.

##### Application to Personal Interest and Well-Being

_The Book of Five Rings_ has also attracted interest from readers seeking a “self-help” guide to becoming more disciplined or successful. Musashi’s principles about training the body and mind to be in sync, his encouragement of focus and discipline, and paying attention to detail are some of the strategies such readers will find of value.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Musashi remains alive and well in the popular consciousness in Japan, and several studies about his life have also appeared in English in recent years (see our “further reading” list at the end of this guide for some biographical sources).

However, in spite of its historical and cultural significance, _The Book of Five Rings_ has some potential obstacles for the modern reader. Some reader reviews complain about Musashi’s habitual vagueness, arguing that it is difficult to discern Musashi’s principles—or to apply them—since he rarely offers explicit guidance. Others argue that the book is limited to its historical or martial arts value, as they struggle to see any meaningful connection to modern contexts. Some readers mention feeling uncomfortable with Musashi’s lack of interest in ethics, reflected in his dispassionate killing of opponents.

The difficulties of Japanese-to-English translation and the vagueness and disorganization of the text present many challenges, especially for the more casual reader. As noted, Musashi’s indifference to moral issues—and his wholehearted embrace of the violence inherent to the Samurai lifestyle—means that the _Book of Five Rings_ lacks a well-developed ethical or philosophical side. Even the more Zen-like meditation in the fifth book, the Book of the Void, is included by Musashi only because he believes “the Void” is the key to being a successful warrior, not because he aspires to Buddhism’s traditional renunciation of violence.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Although _The Book of Five Rings_ is technically a manual of instruction, it doesn’t necessarily _instruct_ the reader especially well—or at least, not in the way a modern reader might expect it to. While reading the book, it is important to keep the following key factors in mind:

1. **Musashi advocates a student-centric approach to learning.** Musashi describes the teacher as a needle and the student as a thread: The teacher facilitates learning by providing general instruction, but it is up to the student to take charge of his learning and apply it to his own life. Musashi frequently exhorts his reader to read carefully and slowly in order to understand the true meaning of his words and to take ownership of his own training—as he states, it is up to each aspiring warrior to find the Way in his own right. Learning is active, not passive.
2. **Musashi believes many things can’t be explained in writing.** Musashi makes things even more challenging for his reader by frequently admitting that he can’t always clearly define or explain what he means. Because of this, much of what Musashi writes about is left vague or open-ended; the reader needs to actively interpret Musashi’s principles for himself, and find ways of putting the principles into practice.
3. **Musashi advocates mastering each principle before moving on to the next one.** In terms of using his manual, Musashi consistently offers only two pieces of advice: to meditate carefully upon his words and to move on to a new principle only once you have thoroughly absorbed the former principle. But Musashi doesn’t say how much time is long enough for absorbing each principle or how the reader will know when he is ready to move on to a new principle. Because of this, it is once again left up to the individual reader to judge when they are ready.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_The Book of Five Rings_ is divided into five chapters or “books,” named after the five core elements in Buddhism: ground, water, fire, wind, and “the Void.” Musashi doesn’t explain his use of “rings” in the work’s title, although the “five rings” appear to be synonymous with the five books, and [could refer metaphorically to the five main areas of Japanese swordsmanship](https://blackbeltmag.com/samurai-training-toshishiro-obata-and-the-five-rings-of-shinkendo-japanese-swordsmanship).

Sometimes the link between a book’s element and its subject matter isn’t fully apparent:

- **The Ground Book.** The element of the first book is earth, because like the earth, the book serves as the foundation for all of Musashi’s strategies.
- **The Water Book.** Musashi argues that the true warrior must be like water. Water can change its form (liquid, solid, gas) and can take the shape of any container it is poured into. Likewise, the warrior must be adaptable and flexible.
- **The Fire Book.** The third book deals with combat, both against individuals and against armies. Like different forms of combat, a fire can be large or small. Its power and intensity mirror the power and intensity of the true warrior.
- **The Wind Book**. Musashi critiques some of the rival Samurai schools of his own day in the fourth book. Musashi claims that, for him, “wind” represents tradition, although he doesn’t explicitly define why tradition is like wind.
- **The Book of the Void.** While “the Void” is not a recognized natural element in most forms of Western thought, it is an important concept in Zen Buddhism. The Void is a state of emptiness in which mind and body become one and achieve perfect tranquility. Musashi believes that the true warrior gains access to the Void if he follows the Way.

Musashi’s general organizational approach in _The Book of Five Rings_ can be a little confusing for readers familiar with other manuals of instruction, both historical and modern. Although a short book, the text is quite dense, and it isn’t always intuitive in its structure. This lack of clear, linear organization can make the thread of Musashi’s thought hard to follow. **Musashi himself admits that his book is disorganized: For this reason, distinguishing main principles from sub-principles—or the ideal order in which the warrior should study these principles—is not clearly laid out.** Furthermore, Musashi doesn’t usually give specific guidance when it comes to _applying_ his principles—there are no handy step-by-step instructions to illustrate each principle before moving on to the next one.

In our guide, we attempt to identify the key themes from each book and present them in ways that could make them useful for the modern reader, as detailed below.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we explain and contextualize Musashi’s main principles. However, **our focus is _not_ on the martial arts aspect of the book, but instead on principles and strategies potentially useful in professional and personal contexts.**

As previously noted, modern readers differ in terms of how they prefer to use _The Book of Five Rings_. While some enjoy applying Musashi’s strategies to the world of modern business, others prefer to stick to a more individualized approach based on adapting Musashi’s teachings to their day-to-day lives. This guide identifies opportunities for application in both senses, but overall we tend to favor a focus on _personal lifestyle_ to provide relevance for the greatest possible number of readers. Furthermore, not everything Musashi says is relevant within a modern context, so we’ve focused on what is directly useful for the modern reader.

It’s also important to note that interpretations of Musashi’s principles can vary, due to his student-centric approach and his insistence upon the reader’s “absorption” of ideas over his explicit instruction. Our guide singles out some key themes for each book and offers guidance for applying the main points to your personal and professional life, but these themes can sometimes be applied in more than one way.
