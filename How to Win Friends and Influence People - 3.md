## Fundamental 3: Appeal to the Other Person’s Interests

### Principles

- Say you like cheesecake. **When you go fishing, you don’t string cheesecake at the end of your line. You attach what the fish wants, which is a worm.**
    - Why do you treat people any differently?
    - Of course you’re interested in what _you_ want. But no one else is. Everyone else is just like you - we all want what _we_ want.
- The only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. Every person in the world knows what they want, and cares about what they get. Approach them from this direction. Appeal to their self-interest for doing anything. Arouse in them a hunger for what they want.
- **The only way to get anyone to do anything is to make the other person _want_ to do it.**
- Henry Ford: “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”

### Tactics

- Before you speak, pause and ask, “what can the other person get out of this?”
- Even challenge yourself to not say anything about what _you_ want.
- **Show other people relentlessly that you want to help them**.
    - The world is full of people who are self-seeking. So the rare person who unselfishly serves others has an enormous advantage.
    - Go out of your way to do things unrelated to your ask.
        - Like a real estate agent who learns about a client’s personal problem and suggests a solution after a meeting.
- When trying to get the other person to do something, don’t talk about how great you or your company is, then ask other people to help you get greater. Instead, start with what the other person is missing out on by not doing something, and the benefits they gain by following your suggested action.
    - A freight terminal wanted a supplier to send its trucks earlier to avoid the afternoon congestion, which slowed down the whole system. The natural way is to start with the terminal’s own problems and requesting that the supplier conform to its expectations. Instead, the better way is to frame it in the supplier’s interests - delayed trucks cause congestion, which causes delays from getting the supplier’s goods delivered on time.
- If the other person disagrees with your course of action, make clear what the advantages and disadvantages of their alternative is. Get them to see the benefits of your suggestion.
- When applying to jobs, tell them how you can meet the company’s goals.
- Salespeople don’t sell products. They show how products solve problems, and people want to buy them. Customers like to feel they are buying - and not being sold.
- When getting people to participate in a social event, don’t talk about what you want and how lonely you are. Excite them about the possibility of the fun event.
- If words don’t work, sometimes showing works better.
    - A Shell territory manager was having trouble with one underperforming store and motivating the manager to do better. Instead, he invited the store’s manager to a brand-new, top of the line, top-selling station. Seeing the new store aroused a visceral want in the manager to do better.

### Examples

- Andrew Carnegie had a sister-in-law whose kids never wrote letters back. He bet someone he could get a reply without asking for one. He wrote letters, at the end mentioning that he was sending a five-dollar-bill (but omitting it). Sure enough, they replied, thanking him for writing and asking where the money was.
- A child didn’t want to go kindergarten. The parents made a list of all the reasons the child should be excited to go to kindergarten, like finger painting. They then excitedly finger painted, and as the child begged to participate, said, “oh no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger paint.”
- Don’t tell your kid to stop smoking. Show them how it’ll make them look at age 40.
- A child may be a stubborn eater. Connect successful eating with success in another problem in her life. Maybe she’s being bullied, and growing stronger faster will get her to whip the bully quickly.
