# Never Split the Difference

## Shortform Introduction

_[Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/never-split-the-difference-chris-vosstahl-raz?variant=32117745385506)_, by Chris Voss (with co-writing assistance from Tahl Raz) aims to provide a comprehensive guide to negotiating theory and strategy, giving you the tools you need to negotiate successfully—whether you’re trying to get a raise at your job, buy a car at the right price, re-sign your lease at a reasonable rent, or any of the other everyday situations where we have to use negotiation to get what _we_ want from somebody _else_.

Voss’s thesis is that good negotiation happens on the _emotional_ level of the brain, not the rational level. He argues that human beings are inherently irrational and impulsive, willing to make decisions with incomplete information and disregard for their own basic material interests—if the decision satisfies a deeper emotional need. Your job as a negotiator, Voss argues, is to practice and display empathy toward your counterpart by understanding her emotions, learning to see the situation from her point of view—and, ultimately, getting her to feel comfortable enough with you to let her emotional guard down.

Understanding the emotional core of negotiation is the key to getting what you want from your counterpart, according to Voss. By tapping into your counterpart’s emotions—what they most desire to gain, what they most fear losing—you can get the decisive upper hand in any negotiation.

### The Book’s Publication

_[Never Split the Difference](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/never-split-the-difference-chris-vosstahl-raz?variant=32117745385506)_ was published in 2016 by [HarperCollins](https://www.harpercollins.com/). The book was a commercial success and was a certified _Wall Street Journal_ bestseller. Since publication, Voss has become a widely regarded expert in negotiation in popular media, and has made multiple appearances on [podcasts, television shows, and filmed lectures](https://www.blackswanltd.com/news-mentions).

### The Book’s Context

While _Never Split the Difference_ is not the only book to deal with negotiation tactics and strategy, it is notable for its primary author’s biography—a former top FBI hostage negotiator who teaches his readers to apply the skills he learned in that high-risk job to the world of everyday negotiation—as well as his fundamental theory of negotiation.

Voss’s book was seen as a direct challenge to _[Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-to-yes)_ (1981) by Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton, which had long been considered the go-to text for negotiation. That book’s philosophy is based on the premise that human beings can use the rational and logical parts of their brains to overcome raw emotion to assess risks, weigh tradeoffs and formulate deals that mutually benefit all parties. Voss’s text, on the other hand, argued instead that human beings are fundamentally emotional and irrational beings and that the secret to successful negotiation is mastering and manipulating your counterpart’s emotional impulses.

Besides _Never Split the Difference_, other significant negotiating texts include:

- _[Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-to-yes)_ (1981) by Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton
- _[Getting Past No: Negotiating in Difficult Situations](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/182088/getting-past-no-by-william-ury/)_ (1991) by William Ury
- _[Bargaining for Advantage: Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/298835/bargaining-for-advantage-by-g-richard-shell/)_ (2008) by G. Richard Shell
- _[Negotiation Genius: How to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Brilliant Results](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/106602/negotiation-genius-by-deepak-malhotra-and-max-bazerman/)_ (2008) by Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazerman
- _[The Negotiation Book: Your Definitive Guide To Successful Negotiating](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Negotiation+Book%3A+Your+Definitive+Guide+to+Successful+Negotiating%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119155461)_ (2011) by Steve Gates

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

_Never Split the Difference_ was seen as an important contribution to the literature of negotiation theory and strategy.

#### Critical Reception

Readers appreciated that the book [focused on practical examples](https://medium.com/@clariceqiu/review-for-chris-vosss-famous-negotiation-book-never-split-the-difference-71e68557a081), without devoting too much time to academic theories or complex analysis of human psychology beyond the simple observation that emotional intelligence—not mathematical problem-solving skills—is the cornerstone of successful negotiation. _Publisher’s Weekly_ also praised the book for its [user-friendly style and colorful anecdotes](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-240780-1) from Voss’s storied career as a hostage negotiator, which helped illuminate the book’s core ideas.

[According to some Amazon reviews](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0062407805/ref=acr_dp_hist_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar), however, other readers found the book repetitive and overly long. They argued that it was too heavy on anecdotes and storytelling and too light on negotiation ideas and principles. Some reviewers also found Voss’s rejection of long-held negotiating principles (like the titular splitting the difference, looking for win-win solutions, or “getting to yes”) was too dismissive and ignored real-world negotiating scenarios where these alternative approaches could yield superior results to his methods.

#### Commentary on Book’s Approach

Voss begins by discussing the emotional component of negotiation and making the argument that tapping into your counterpart’s emotional drives and impulses is the key to getting what you want from them. He then highlights a range of tactics like listening actively, reflecting back, labeling, and calculated empathy that you can use to put your counterpart at ease and get them to let their emotional guard down. Voss argues that these tactics will put your counterpart in a position where they’re more willing to divulge crucial information that will give you the upper hand in the negotiation. He also analyzes the flaws of commonly accepted negotiating principles like “win-win deals” or “getting to yes,” before presenting some step-by-step scenarios for you to model your negotiation techniques from.

Throughout, Voss uses stories from his unique background as an FBI hostage negotiator and university professor to highlight the book’s main ideas and principles. He also uses hypothetical examples to give the reader a blueprint for how to apply his negotiation tactics in everyday situations.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve reorganized the chapters to improve general flow and readability. Specifically, we’ve merged the first three chapters of Voss’s book into one chapter since they all deal with the general topics of emotions, cognitive biases, and how to turn them to your advantage in a negotiation. We’ve also moved a section on cognitive biases that originally appeared in Chapter 1 of Voss’s book to Chapter 7. He addresses cognitive biases in both chapters, which is somewhat redundant and disrupts the logical flow of ideas. Thus, we’ve made the choice to consolidate this discussion in that later chapter. Finally, we’ve moved Chapter 7 to follow Chapters 1-3 because its discussion of safety and autonomy logically follows those chapters’ analysis of how negotiation is primarily emotion-based.

We’ve also supplemented Voss’s ideas with findings from outside research, incorporated the negotiation strategies of writers whose ideas differ from his, and added unique examples to clarify his points.
