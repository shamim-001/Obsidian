## 1-Page Summary

Released in 2010, _The Gifts of Imperfection_ is a New York Times bestseller by researcher, speaker, and author Brené Brown. The book explores 10 strategies for “living Wholeheartedly”: a concept Brown devised after years of research into shame, vulnerability, and self-worth. Wholehearted living has many aspects and nuances, but we can succinctly understand it as **a way of life that cultivates a feeling of worthiness.**

### Worthiness: A Primer

_The Gifts of Imperfection_ begins with a primer on the concept of worthiness, which Brown defines early in the book because it’s foundational to understanding the book’s other key concepts. According to Brown, worthiness is **the conviction that you are good enough as you are, flaws and all, and deserve to be loved.** In simpler terms, feeling worthiness is **having high self-esteem.**

> **The Low Self-Esteem Epidemic**
> 
> In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown acknowledges that many of us struggle to see our worthiness. **But _why_ do so many of us have low self-esteem?** Many writers and researchers have attempted to answer this question. For instance, writer and speaker Rachel Hollis writes in her book _[Girl, Wash Your Face](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/girl-wash-your-face)_ that [low self-worth is often a result of childhood trauma](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/girl-wash-your-face/lie-3). [Psychological research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020764019894618) supports this theory.
> 
> Childhood trauma is widespread—the US government’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports that, by age 16, [almost 70% of young people have experienced some form of trauma](https://www.samhsa.gov/child-trauma/understanding-child-trauma). Therefore, it’s not surprising that so many adults have low self-esteem.

#### Cultivating Worthiness

So we’ve learned what worthiness is, according to Brown. The next question is, _how can we cultivate worthiness_? Brown’s research suggests that there are three values that you need to practice to increase your sense of worthiness:

1. **Ordinary courage:** Being brave enough to be vulnerable and honestly express who you are, how you feel, and what you’ve experienced (for example, having the courage to admit to your boss that you’re struggling with your workload and need help)
2. **Compassion:** Being kind to yourself and others
3. **Connection:** In Brown’s view, an intangible energy generated when we form an open, judgment-free, and mutually sustaining bond with another person. (More simply, understand connection as building meaningful and fulfilling relationships with others.)

(Shortform note: **These three values are the “gifts of imperfection” referred to in the book’s title.** They’re “gifts” of imperfection because they come about only when you’re willing to be vulnerable. You develop the courage to accept that you’re imperfect, and you connect with other people because they empathize with your vulnerability. Finally, you become compassionate with other people because you realize nobody’s perfect and forgive their imperfections. In contrast, if we all lived perfect lives free from vulnerability, struggles, and mistakes, we’d never need to put these values into practice—meaning we’d never reap their benefits.)

#### Shame: A Barrier to Worthiness

According to Brown, one of the main barriers to developing worthiness is **shame.** **Based on her research, she defines shame as feeling that you don’t deserve to be loved because you’ll never be “good enough.”** Brown argues that shame prevents worthiness from developing because **it’s completely antithetical to everything worthiness represents.** It’s built on foundations of fear, self-hatred, and the sense that you’re not “enough.” Worthiness simply can’t flourish if you think this way.

(Shortform note: In _The Gifts of Imperfection_, Brown predominantly highlights the negative effects of shame on _self-worth_. However, shame can affect us in many other ways than just inhibiting worthiness. For instance, in his book _[Healing the Shame That Binds You](https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Healing-the-Shame-That-Binds-You/John-Bradshaw/9780757303234)_, the late author and speaker [John Bradshaw](https://www.johnbradshaw.com/books/healing-the-shame-that-binds-you) linked shame to the development of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. He also argued that shame informs numerous toxic behaviors, including addiction, forming unhealthy relationships, and dishonesty.)

##### **Overcoming Shame**

According to Brown, the best way to overcome shame and remove this obstacle to worthiness is to **develop shame resilience.** She conceives shame resilience as **being able to identify shame as it occurs and move past it in a healthy way that protects your worthiness.** Healthy ways to approach shame include confiding in someone trustworthy regarding your feelings of shame and evaluating whether the thing that’s triggered your shame is _actually_ something to be ashamed of.

>     
> - _[Dare to Lead](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead)_, in which she focuses on [shame in the workplace and how leaders can help people who feel ashamed](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-1-4)

### Practices for Wholehearted Living

Now that we’ve explored worthiness and the factors that help and hinder its development, we’ll examine Brené Brown’s strategies for living Wholeheartedly: **behaviors that Brown believes develop worthiness and allow us to live a Wholehearted life.** Brown's strategies aren't always directly related to worthiness or the gifts of imperfection, but her belief in the power of courage, compassion, and connection informs them all. We’ve tried to link the strategies to these “gifts” and worthiness wherever possible.

We’ve also reorganized Brown’s strategies and grouped them according to three themes to better show the connections between the ideas. Many strategies arguably have the same ultimate goal, such as increasing your overall happiness or helping you to accept yourself.

#### Theme #1: Be Yourself

First, let’s examine three strategies for living Wholeheartedly that all involve you being and accepting your true, authentic self:

##### 1) Be Authentic

According to Brown, being authentic is a way of thinking and acting: **It’s actively deciding to show your true self to the world.** This means _all_ of your true self, including the more vulnerable parts—for example, your fears, your imperfections, and your quirks.

Brown claims being authentic is important because **inauthenticity chips away at your worthiness and may impact your overall mental wellbeing.** She argues that being inauthentic can lead to depression, anxiety, and numerous other mental struggles. Furthermore, inauthenticity is a rejection of self-acceptance and self-love. Deciding that your true self needs to remain hidden reinforces the idea that you’re fundamentally not good enough.

> **The Benefits of Authenticity**
> 
> Research supports Brown’s assertion that being inauthentic is harmful to your mental health and worthiness—and, by extension, that being authentic _benefits_ your mental health and worthiness. One study found that [living authentically leads to greater general life satisfaction as well as increased wellbeing](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1064&context=mapp_capstone). Another study [linked living authentically to having high self-esteem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251802973_The_role_of_authenticity_in_healthy_psychological_functioning_and_subjective_well-being)—or as Brown would call it, worthiness.
> 
> Authenticity might also bolster your career prospects, especially if you work in sales. In his book _[Start With Why](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why)_, Simon Sinek argues that being an authentic and honest salesperson, rather than an off-putting, manipulative one, [will help you build long-lasting relationships with customers](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/start-with-why/chapter-5) who trust you.

##### 2) Reject Comparison

Brown’s next strategy for living Wholeheartedly is **refusing to compare yourself to others.** Brown argues that when you compare, you abandon attempts to be and accept your true self, as well as efforts to see your worthiness. Instead, you focus on “winning” in comparison to your peers: in other words, comparing favorably to them.

Brown believes that you can reduce your temptation to compare by recognizing and celebrating your individuality. Furthermore, she states that **you can cultivate your sense of individuality by being creative** (for instance, by painting, sewing, or writing). Nobody else has the same creative skillset as you or expresses their creativity in the same way as you. Therefore, your creative talents represent a part of you that’s individual and incomparable.

> **The Benefits of Creativity**
> 
> Creativity isn’t just beneficial to your sense of individuality: Research has shown that being creative can improve your mental and physical health in various other ways, too. For instance, a 2010 review of the existing literature on creativity and health found that [being creative has beneficial effects like](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804629/):
> 
> - Helping people to process trauma
>     
> - Reducing anxiety
>     
> - Enabling people to express difficult thoughts and emotions
>     
> - Reducing stress and compassion fatigue among carers
>     
> 
> One study even found that [being creative can increase the CD4+ lymphocyte count of HIV patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15039514/)—in effect, strengthening their immune systems.

##### 3) Use Intuition

According to Brown, to live Wholeheartedly, **you must accept and trust your intuition:** the powerful “gut feeling” that you—usually unconsciously and automatically—develop about situations. (Shortform note: Brown’s definition of intuition mirrors Malcolm Gladwell’s concept of unconscious thinking, as expressed in _[Blink](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink)_. Both authors view this type of thinking as [a powerful process that helps us make good decisions quickly, without realizing we’re doing it.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/blink/introduction))

Brown argues that many of us ignore intuition because we don’t trust it: We don’t feel _certain_ that our gut feeling is right. Instinctively, humans hate uncertainty—and that hatred makes us reject the “uncertain” gut feeling. To overcome this fear of uncertainty (and, consequently, become comfortable with following our intuition), Brown suggests **embracing** **faith:** the belief that things _will work out_, even if you can’t be _certain_ that they will.

(Shortform note: Brown doesn’t explore in detail the link between embracing faith and embracing intuition. However, having faith may help you to use intuition because **you become willing to act on your gut feeling, despite the risk that it’s wrong, because you have faith that it might be right.)**

#### Theme #2: Develop Inner Strength

Brown’s next three strategies for living Wholeheartedly all involve **developing inner strength:** the fortitude necessary to fight unhealthy emotional processes and adopt healthy ones instead.

##### 4) Combat Perfectionism

Brown’s first strategy for developing inner strength is **combating perfectionism.** Brown argues that perfectionism is harmful because **it’s founded on completely unrealistic expectations:** You’re never going to be perfect (or even _appear_ to be perfect). However, according to Brown, the perfectionist mindset won’t concede that it sets unrealistic standards. Instead, it tells you that you don’t appear perfect because _you aren’t good enough_, causing you to blame, shame, and judge yourself.

(Shortform note: As well as causing you to shame, blame, and judge yourself, perfectionism can have various other negative effects. Research has linked it to [increased vulnerability to depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169326/) and [eating disorders](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.8328&rep=rep1&type=pdf), as well as [increased suicide risk](http://dhss.alaska.gov/SuicidePrevention/Documents/pdfs_sspc/sspcfollowback2-07.pdf).)

So, how can we fight perfectionism? According to Brown, **showing yourself compassion can help you to _embrace_ your imperfections, rather than punish yourself for them or hide them.** One way to show self-compassion is to engage in positive self-talk—talk that’s encouraging and kind about yourself and your flaws, rather than critical and judgmental.

(Shortform note: Engaging in compassionate self-talk can do more than just help you fight perfectionism. According to Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves in their book _[Emotional Intelligence 2.0](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence-2-0)_, positive self-talk can also [help you to overcome challenging times and keep your mood positive day-to-day.](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence-2-0/chapter-6))

##### 5) Build Resilience

Brown’s next strategy for living Wholeheartedly is **building resilience**. While Brown presents various strategies for doing this, she argues that the most important one is **embracing spirituality.** She defines spirituality as **recognizing the existence of a higher power that connects us all**. (The “higher power” in this equation could be a religious power, such as a god, but it doesn’t have to be.) According to Brown, the feeling of connection to others and a higher power that spirituality brings makes overcoming tough times feel easier: Being resilient is less challenging if you feel you’re not alone.

(Shortform note: Embracing spirituality or religion may have more benefits to mental health than just increasing resilience: [Research links spirituality to decreased levels of depression and anxiety](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/impact-spirituality.pdf). However, the picture isn’t clear-cut: Some forms of spirituality, such as strict religious observance, may trigger or worsen mental health issues.)

##### 6) Practice Stillness and Calm

Brown’s final strategy for developing inner strength and living Wholeheartedly is **fighting anxiety by practicing stillness and calm.** According to Brown, **practicing stillness means taking the time to be still and quiet.** This might take the form of praying, meditating, or quietly reflecting. (Shortform note: Research confirms that various types of stillness—such as [meditation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0272735885900169), [prayer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20391859/), and [mindfulness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0260691714002226)—can reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression.)

Meanwhile, in Brown’s view, calmness involves **stopping yourself from acting on strong, reactionary negative emotions** such as anger or fear: for instance, stopping yourself from reacting to bad news by lashing out at the messenger. To stop yourself from being harmfully reactionary, **Brown suggests taking a moment to breathe before you react to things.** This gives you the time to think before you act and analyze whether acting on your emotions is the right approach.

> **Other Ways to Keep Calm**
> 
> Pausing before you react isn’t the only way to promote calmness. Daniel Goleman, the author of _[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence)_, recommends [challenging your anxious thoughts](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/emotional-intelligence/chapter-5-2) to promote calmness. For instance, if anxiety makes you think, “this situation is a disaster,” you might challenge the thought by asking, “is this situation _really_ that bad? Will I even remember it in a week, a month, or a year?”
> 
> Approaching a loved one and asking for a hug may also help you to keep calm. In _[The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score)_, Bessel van der Kolk argues that [physical touch such as hugging has a soothing effect](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-body-keeps-the-score/chapter-8), helping even victims of trauma to feel protected and calm.

#### Theme #3: Foster Happiness and Joy

Brown’s final four strategies for Wholehearted living all promote happiness or joy. (Note that Brown conceives happiness and joy as two distinct emotions, as we’ll discuss when we explore practicing gratitude.)

##### 7) Find Meaningful Work That Uses Your Gifts and Talents

One strategy for finding happiness and living Wholeheartedly is **finding meaningful work** **that enables you to use your gifts and talents.** This might be paid work: However, it doesn’t have to be. Meaningful work can be anything from parenting, to volunteering, to engaging in a hobby.

According to Brown, **failing to find meaningful work that uses your gifts and talents can trigger** **numerous negative emotions, like shame and anger.** In contrast, _finding_ meaningful work can provide such benefits as increased happiness and an increased sense of purpose.

> **Meaningful Work and Worthiness**
> 
> In this section, Brown doesn’t explicitly address how finding meaningful work that uses your gifts and talents (or not doing so) can impact your worthiness. However, she implies that **not finding meaningful work affects your worthiness _negatively_.** By not incorporating your talents into your daily life through such work, you may believe that you’re not contributing your full potential to the world, making you feel a sense of worthlessness.
> 
> **Conversely, each time you engage in meaningful work, you’ll be reminded that you’re good at something:** the gift or talent that this work uses. This will increase your sense of worthiness.

##### 8) Embrace Rest and Play

Brown’s next strategy for living Wholeheartedly and finding happiness in the process is **embracing rest and play.** By “play,” Brown means **doing things that you enjoy that have no real purpose.** By “rest,” she means **getting enough sleep to feel refreshed.** She argues that rest is important because sleep deprivation can have serious health effects such as [depression, diabetes, and heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/index.html).

(Shortform note: Other negative effects of sleep deprivation, as outlined by Matthew Walker in _[Why We Sleep](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/why-we-sleep)_, include [inhibited emotional control, reduced fertility in both men and women, a weakened immune system](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/why-we-sleep/chapter-7), and, in teenagers, [increased suicidal ideation](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/why-we-sleep/chapter-7).)

Brown notes that many of us eschew play and rest because they’re not productive activities—and society teaches us that we need to be productive at all times. However, she argues that **you’re more likely to be productive, focus, and produce high-quality work if you’re feeling happy and refreshed thanks to rest and play.**

(Shortform note: Research backs up Brown’s assertion that getting enough rest and play will _aid_ your productivity, not harm it. Various brain functions, such as [decision-making, focus, and problem-solving, are enhanced](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-deprivation-and-deficiency) when you get lots of sleep—and these are all processes that will help you to perform at your best in the workplace. Likewise, studies have suggested that play enhances workplace productivity by [encouraging creativity and innovative thinking](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1123863.pdf).)

##### 9) Practice Gratitude and Feel Joy

According to Brown, practicing gratitude involves **frequently making time to recognize all of the things you’re grateful for.** For instance, you could keep a gratitude journal or do a regular gratitude meditation. According to Brown, being grateful is beneficial because it breeds **joy:** a deep contentment with life that’s specifically _brought on by practicing gratitude_. (This makes joy distinct from happiness, which is _brought on by specific and short-term circumstances_—for example, getting a good appraisal at work.)

(Shortform note: Brown seems to be unique in defining joy as a positive emotion specifically linked to practicing gratitude. In fact, the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of joy seems to fit closer with Brown’s definition of happiness. It describes joy as [a positive feeling sparked by things like being fortunate or finding success](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/joy): short-term circumstances that Brown links to happiness, not joy.)

> **The Other Benefits of Gratitude**
> 
> Feeling joyful may not be the only benefit of practicing gratitude. Research suggests that gratitude has a wide range of benefits to mental and physical health. One study found that practicing gratitude [improved participants’ overall mood and the quality of their sleep](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/6Emmons-BlessingsBurdens.pdf).
> 
> Another study noted that [practicing gratitude reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicola-Petrocchi/publication/283045019_The_impact_of_gratitude_on_depression_and_anxiety_the_mediating_role_of_criticizing_attacking_and_reassuring_the_self/links/562748ad08aeabddac9450ae/The-impact-of-gratitude-on-depression-and-anxiety-the-mediating-role-of-criticizing-attacking-and-reassuring-the-self.pdf), possibly because it encourages a mindset of self-compassion rather than self-criticism: Presumably, practicing gratitude includes being grateful for _yourself,_ too.

##### 10) Laugh, Sing, and Dance

Brown’s final strategy for living Wholeheartedly and finding happiness is **making the time to laugh, sing, and dance**. According to Brown, these practices are beneficial because **the sense of emotional connection they provide can help you to manage difficult feelings.** For example, finding a song that matches your sad mood and singing or dancing along will remind you that you’re not the only person to have struggled. This sense of connection may give you the strength you need to work through your sadness. Furthermore, Brown notes that **laughing, singing, and dancing _with another person_ creates a _shared_ emotional experience** that strengthens your connection.

(Shortform note: The acts of laughing, singing, and dancing also have many **benefits to mental and physical health.** For instance, research has demonstrated that [laughing reduces the number of stress hormones in our blood while also producing endorphins](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjem/239/3/239_243/_pdf), which can boost mood and help us to fight depression. Meanwhile, singing has physical health benefits such as [improving posture, increasing breathing capacity](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09654280210434228/full/html), and [having increased control over breathing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/146642400112100409). Finally, dancing can improve everything from [your bone strength, to the health of your lungs, to your balance](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/dance-health-benefits#health-benefits-of-dancing).)
