## Chapter 5: Build Your Deep Work Environment

In addition to scheduling time for deep work, Newport encourages you to build an environment that supports deep work by reducing distraction triggers.

(Shortform note: This chapter focuses on _external triggers_ that might prevent you from focusing on your work. We’ll explore _internal triggers_ that drive you to distraction in Chapter 6.)

### Step 1: Create a Deep-Work-Only Environment

There are several ways that you can create an environment that lends itself to undistracted focus:

#### Designate a Deep Work Space

Newport says you should choose a place that you go to _only_ for deep work (like a conference room, the library, or an office in your home)—you won’t do _any_ shallow work in this place. Save it for another place dedicated only to shallow work. Compartmentalizing your location this way will cement the habit of deep work more strongly.

Once you have a location for your deep work, Newport urges you to add support in ways that allow for more focused deep work—like starting with coffee, having enough food, and integrating light exercise into your routine.

(Shortform note: In _[Atomic Habits](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/atomic-habits/part-ii)_, James Clear discusses the power of using environmental cues to trigger desirable behaviors. Having a designated workspace is one type of environmental cue, but you can set up more—for example, lighting a specific candle or starting a certain playlist each time you start working. Over time, your brain will associate these cues with deep work and you’ll more easily ease into focus.)

#### Invest (Literally) in Your Deep Work

Newport discusses the possibility of making a “grand gesture”—that is, committing an investment, such as renting a hotel room or retreating to an isolated cabin, to jumpstart your activity. He reasons that if your deep work space costs you money or is difficult to get to, you’ll feel more compelled to use it.

(Shortform note: Several critics labeled Newport’s examples of “grand gestures” as out of touch and useless to the majority of knowledge workers. In _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-4)_, Nir Eyal explores an idea similar to Newport’s grand gestures but approaches it from a more accessible angle. He suggests creating “pacts” that attach a monetary value to a task you want to complete—if you perform the task, you get to keep the money, but if you don’t complete the task, you lose the money. For example, you might give a trusted friend $100, telling her that she’s only allowed to give the money back if you make a certain deadline.)

#### Try Collaborating

While most deep work is done alone, Newport suggests that it can be helpful to work alongside someone who’s doing the same type of deep work as you are—their presence can create a sort of competition or productive pressure that makes it easier to stick with your work.

(Shortform note: This is a tactic used by people with ADHD and referred to as “body doubling.” Many people with ADHD report [becoming more focused and productive when another person is sitting in the same room](https://add.org/the-body-double/), even if that person isn’t doing the same type of work and isn’t interacting with or pressuring them. Why this works is unclear, but some researchers think it may be due to [the mirror neuron system, which developed early in our evolution when humans depended on being part of a group for survival.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201601/why-we-copy-each-other-and-5-ways-it-can-change-us) This system directs the brain to mirror others’ actions—when someone with ADHD observes another person being calm and focused, their brain copies the behavior.)

### Step 2: Get Rid of Distractions

Newport points out that a key to spending more time in deep work is to avoid distractions that take you out of deep work.

(Shortform note: You may think that it’s not necessary to _cut out_ potential distractions, instead opting for simple management techniques like placing your phone face down to avoid looking at notifications. However, studies show that [when working on the computer, people become distracted, on average, every 40 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%20wo=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y). Even if your phone is sitting face down on your desk, it’s still an available distraction to reach for.)

In Chapter 1, Newport outlined three major distractors that are pervasive in current office culture: open floor plans, social media, and instant messaging. In this section, we’ll explore not only solutions to these three problems but also to a fourth major distractor that Newport visits later in the book—email.

#### Floorplans

In Chapter 1, Newport discussed the ideal office layout for deep work: the “hub and spoke” model, in which there are both communal spaces for serendipitous encounters or collaboration and private, isolated spaces for uninterrupted focus.

(Shortform note: While Newport suggests this model as a solution to the current trend of open floor plans, he doesn’t give any type of workaround for those who have no control over the layout of their workspace. In _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-3-1)_, Nir Eyal suggests that workers who find themselves in a less-than-ideal, distracting workspace try creating visual cues to show others that they need to be left alone. This may look like a certain hat you wear when you’re in deep work mode, a small “Do not interrupt” sign on top of your monitor, or a pair of noise-canceling headphones that have the added effect of blocking out distracting conversations.)

#### Social Media

Newport points out that for many people, one of their greatest distractions is social media. Social media, and much of the Internet in general, is _designed_ to get you addicted to its content, and it can easily derail you from meeting your true goals.

(Shortform note: In _[Hooked](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/hooked)_, Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover explore the different methods that media companies use to get—and keep—your attention. The authors explain that not only is this information helpful in understanding and breaking your tech addictions, but it can also help you make _good habits_ (like deep work) more “addictive.” For example, you may create a trigger: Each day, your phone’s alarm goes off at 3 p.m. (the beginning of your afternoon slump) and prompts you to put on your sneakers and go for a walk. Over time, this trigger will program your brain to crave the feeling of exercise each afternoon.)

**Like shallow work, social media is insidious in that it seems like you’re doing productive things when really the gains are minor.** For example, people believe that Facebook connects them to others or surfaces relevant news. This sounds good in principle, but Newport claims that the real result is superficial—the acquaintances you’re making are shallow and unlikely to be the center of your social life. You’ll arrange to see the people you _really_ care about outside of Facebook. Similarly, the news you come across on your feed may be fun to read, but for the most part, it doesn’t move you closer to your major life goals.

Newport says that to counteract the distracting effects of social media, some people declare Internet sabbaticals and go completely offline for a month. He doesn’t agree with this method—he says it’s not necessary to be a Luddite, just like artisans don’t forgo all tools made of metal. Social media _can_ be useful if you use it deliberately. Unfortunately, as Newport explains, many people use the “any benefit” argument—that is, a **technology tool is justified if it provides _any_ benefit to the user.** He argues that this thinking dilutes your focus. Instead, you should concentrate your time only on the most effective tools, instead of spreading it across many somewhat effective tools, in order to become more productive.

(Shortform note: Reviewers have pointed out that Newport has never utilized social media and therefore may not be the best authority to comment on what different platforms can and can’t do for its users. Consequently, his view that Facebook usually only creates shallow relationships feels outdated: It’s not uncommon these days to live and work in cities or countries far from your friends and family. Social media, notably Facebook—[as many expat communities report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120307449)—is a simple way to both establish relationships in your new city and stay in touch with loved ones you’re not able to meet up with in person.)

To begin managing the way you use tech, Newport suggests taking the following steps to examine each of your tech tools in regard to their **benefits, cost, and the opportunity cost**. This will help you clearly see which tools are worth your time and which aren’t.

##### 1) List Your Goals and Goal-Supporting Activities

**First, make a list of your most important goals—professional and personal—and then list the two or three activities that help you progress most toward these goals.** Newport notes that these activities should be specific enough to give you direction, but general enough to be repeatable.

- For example, “Do good research” is too vague of a goal to be actionable. “Finish paper A” is a one-time goal that doesn’t suggest a repeatable practice to keep moving you forward. Instead, try to name a specific, ongoing activity such as, “Regularly read the cutting-edge papers in the field.”

(Shortform note: While Newport’s arguments are generally against social media, your goal-supporting activities don’t _have_ to be. For example, reviewers are critical of Newport’s claim that journalists and authors on social media are wasting their time—after all, he says, there are many successful authors without social media accounts. This argument misses the important detail that the authors he names found their success _before_ social media became such a pervasive advertising tool. These days, for many authors trying to break into the industry, [establishing a presence on social media is an essential part of marketing their work](https://heatherdemetrios.medium.com/what-a-big-5-publisher-will-tell-you-about-marketing-your-book-f47be2e12dd3).)

##### 2) Examine Your Tech Tools

**For each of your major tools**—for example, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit—**describe how they contribute (or don’t contribute) meaningfully to your important goals.**

- For example, if your professional goal is to develop innovative products that solve people’s problems, then spending time on Reddit or marketing yourself on Twitter may be less effective than focusing on the problem area and talking to experts in the field.

(Shortform note: To fully understand a tech tool’s effect on you and your goals, you must be honest with yourself about _why_ you’re using the tool. Research shows that [your intent in using social media determines how negatively or positively it will affect your well-being](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417730833)—those who use social media to check out what others are up to develop negative well-being due to constant comparison, while those who use social media to chat with their friends develop positive well-being due to strengthened social bonds.)

**If you’re on the fence about how much you need a tool, do an experiment: Quit for 30 days and see what happens.** Afterward, consider whether your life would have been notably better if you had been able to use that tool.

- Newport argues that what holds people back from quitting is the conceit that people care what you have to say. In reality, much of social media for most people is a mutual exchange: “Like my stuff and I’ll like yours, too.” It’s not a genuine interaction, and it can be easily replaced by other people. If you quit social media, you may find that you weren’t missed at all. If anyone cares, they’ll get in touch with you another way. (Shortform note: This doesn’t take into account that most people aren’t closely tracking their followers—your absence may go unnoticed, even by people who care about you. Newport’s argument that people who don’t reach out don’t _really_ care about you [can make you feel isolated or forgotten](https://www.sclhealth.org/blog/2018/10/quitting-social-media/), when the real reason for their lack of contact may simply be that they _don’t realize_ you’re not seeing their posts.)
- He says if you quit reading news or participating in online flame wars, you may find yourself feeling more content, and will likely find you’re not at all upset about hearing big announcements a few hours after everyone on social media. (Shortform note: This feeling of contentment is due to _physically_ being less stressed: Studies have shown that [receiving constant updates about events (on a global and personal scale) raises your cortisol—stress hormone—levels](https://www.thehealthy.com/mental-health/quit-social-media/). When you step away from social media, your cortisol levels return to normal.)

(Shortform note: Breaking out of the dopamine cycle of social media is easier said than done. There will be an adjustment period: Research shows that [it takes about eight days for your brain to calm down and become accustomed to a lower level of stimulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y). According to psychologist Jonathan Bricker, the most successful way to respond to your inevitable social media craving during this time is not to ignore your craving—this only makes it stronger. Instead, [acknowledge your craving and accept its presence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTb3d5cjSFI). Often, taking the time to go through this thought exercise is enough for the craving to subside.)

##### 3) Find a New Way to Spend Your Time

**Tally up the time you spend on each tool that doesn’t support your goal, then think of alternative, goal-supporting activities you could fill this time with.** Newport explains that these more meaningful activities are the true opportunity cost of distracting tech tools—the more time you spend on relatively meaningless distractions, the less time you have to work on activities that move you toward what you _really_ want. He suggests finding structured hobbies with defined goals, such as reading a certain number of books or knitting a scarf. He notes two benefits of these types of activities:

1. If you accomplish a goal in your free time, you’ll feel more fulfilled than if you spent hours meandering aimlessly on the Internet. You’ll also begin the next day more relaxed and ready to do deep work.
2. Goal-supporting activities give your brain a break. You might think that your brain _needs_ “vegging” activities like scrolling Instagram or bingeing Netflix in order to recover from cognitively demanding tasks—but Newport argues that all your brain really wants is change, not rest.

(Shortform note: In _[Digital Minimalism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/digital-minimalism/1-page-summary)_, Newport explores ways you can “reclaim” your time and attention and refocus on what’s important to you, such as your family, your relationships, and your leisure time. For the most part, he suggests “analog” activities that take you away from your screens, but keep in mind that there are plenty of online activities—such as taking classes, learning new skills, or beating video games—that can help advance you toward different goals.)

##### 4) Keep or Discard the Tool

**Newport recommends adopting a tool only if you’re sure the benefits substantially outweigh the negative impact and the opportunity cost.** Carefully consider whether it would be better to shift the time spent on each tool to alternative activities.

Most likely, you’ll find that a few significant activities drive most of the progress toward your most important goals. Newport claims that once you discover this, you’ll be able to discard the numerous tasks that aren’t actually productive.

(Shortform note: In _[Digital Minimalism](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/digital-minimalism/chapter-2),_ Newport adds another step to this process of focusing your concentration—**thinking in features.** Think of each tool you keep in terms of _the individual features useful to you,_ rather than as a single tool. For example, you might think of Facebook in terms of its Messenger application, event announcements, and several groups you joined to learn guitar. This exercise helps train you to use each tech tool only in its most useful ways, instead of lumping the good and bad uses together.)

#### Instant Messaging

In Chapter 1, Newport contends instant messaging systems that keep us in constant contact with colleagues mean we never have undistracted moments in which to do deep work. (Shortform note: Newport doesn’t offer a specific antidote as he does for other distractions such as social media—however, his other techniques such as using tools only in ways that support your goals, could apply as well to instant messaging.)

> **Tips on Resisting the Distraction of Slack...From Slack Employees**
> 
> Many people blame the instant messaging platform Slack [for the havoc instant communication is wreaking on employee focus.](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/slack-ruining-work) However, on his blog, Nir Eyal points out [that Slack employees actually have an exceptionally healthy relationship with the produc](https://www.nirandfar.com/slack-use/)t. He chalks this up to several practices:
> 
> - **They schedule time for instant messaging:** Instead of letting messages ping all day, Slack employees block off time in their schedules for writing and responding to messages. When they need to do uninterrupted work, they set an “away” message that notes when they’ll be available to chat.
>     
> - **They use the Do Not Disturb feature:** Most Slack employees set their Do Not Disturb feature, which blocks notifications from getting through to them, to turn on automatically after work hours and on the weekends. (Eyal notes that this practice is almost unnecessary: Slack employees have a shared understanding that it’s rude to send messages outside of work hours.)
>     
> - **Leaders set a strong example:** The foundation of Slack employees’ healthy relationship with instant messaging is the example set by their leaders, who take their role as culture influencers seriously. For example, they regularly remind employees that they’re expected to be out of the office by a certain time every night and should _not_ be working from home in the evening or on the weekend. Leaders are careful not to message anyone outside of office hours, knowing that their employees take cues from them.
>     
> 
> Instant messaging itself isn’t the problem—it’s the way employees are (or aren’t) trained to use it effectively. As an employee, you can create policies around your instant messaging use. As a manager, you can adopt best practices and demonstrate them to your employees.

#### Emails

Newport claims that emails are an insidious time suck, both for senders and recipients. (Shortform note: Judging from the popularity of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/katehelendowney/status/1415091481094750208), he’s not the only one who feels this way.) He says many people use emails unthinkingly or as a quick way to toss responsibilities into someone else’s court—the worst offenders, he says, are the nightmare email threads in which multiple parties volley dozens of emails just to schedule a meeting time. Newport suggests several ways to reduce the time you spend on the shallow work of unproductive emails.

##### 1) Make Sure Your Emails Contain _All_ Essential Information

Newport explains that when replying to an email, you should articulate: 1) the current state of things, 2) what the ultimate goal is, and 3) what the most effective next steps are. He says this prevents unproductive email volleys, where each email adds incremental information at the cost of distracting multiple people. It also closes the mental loop for you, preventing mental residue from accumulating.

For example:

- **Bad reply:** “Here’s the edited draft. Thoughts?” **Good reply:** “I’ve reviewed your draft, added major comments, and made line edits for specific language. Things are looking good—you can take this to the final draft without running it by me again.“
- **Bad reply:** “Yes, let’s meet for lunch. When works for you?” **Good reply:** “Here are times over the next week when I’m available. If any of these work for you, let me know, and please send a calendar invite. If none of these work, please send over a few times that do.”
- **Bad reply:** “Where were we on that project?” **Good reply:** “In the next week, send me your notes of everything we’ve discussed about the project. I’ll combine it with my own notes, put them in a shared doc, and highlight the most promising next steps. Then, let’s meet to discuss the problem—here are six times when I’m available.”

He says that at first, writing these types of emails will take more time, but you’ll save many more minutes in the future by cutting email volleys down.

(Shortform note: Newport takes the idea of closing the “mental loop” from David Allen’s _[Getting Things Done](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/getting-things-done)_ system. When you fail to clearly define and delegate the next steps (no matter how big or small a project), you keep too many thoughts and unanswered questions on your plate and can feel scattered or unfocused. On the other hand, sending out emails that ask recipients for clearly defined actions lets you mentally put the project aside until the action is performed.)

##### 2) Publish Your Email Policy, and Respond (Or Don’t Respond) Accordingly

**Make sure people who are interested in contacting you know how you’ll handle incoming emails, and which emails you’ll reject.** (Shortform note: Newport recommends posting this information on your website. If you don’t have a website, post it on other public platforms such as your LinkedIn page.) Newport suggests a clear message such as, “Please only contact me via email if you have a speaking engagement, collaboration, or introduction that you think I may be interested in. Please know that I may not reply unless it’s a good fit for my schedule and interests.”

He says that by publicizing the fact that you may not respond, you give yourself the mental freedom to ignore emails that aren’t thoughtful or are misaligned with your goals. This frees you from the struggle to make the connection _meaningful_ and puts the responsibility on the sender—if you haven’t replied and they truly think their message is important enough, they’ll follow up with another, hopefully more thoughtful, email.

While this policy may sound rude, Newport points out that the sender likely hopes for the same courtesy for her own incoming emails and won’t feel that you’re being rude. He says that this worry is also based on the assumption that people care what you have to say and are pining for a response—but in reality, most email senders may not care that they get a response at all.

> **What To Do if You _Must_ Answer Emails**
> 
> Newport’s practices aren’t “one size fits all.” While they might work for _some_ knowledge workers—professors, authors like Newport—most knowledge workers aren’t in a position to tell others what they will and won’t respond to, and [studies show that ignoring work emails is actually a sign of ineffective management and makes you look unconscientious](https://medium.com/@duncanjwatts/the-organizational-spectroscope-7f9f239a897c). Other authors offer suggestions on ways to approach email productively:
> 
> In _[Indistractable](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/indistractable/part-3-1),_ Nir Eyal gives two key tips: process your email in batches and slow down your response time.
> 
> - **Batch processing:** Eyal suggests blocking off several periods during your daily schedule for reading email—having a dedicated time for email prevents you from task-switching to look at email during other parts of the day. During each processing period, tag your emails by urgency: “Today” or “This week.” Then, block off some time at the end of the day to respond to “Today” emails and a block of time on Friday to respond to “This Week” emails.
>     
> - **Slow down:** He explains that humans have an innate need to imitate one another—if you reply quickly to a colleague, they’ll reply quickly to you. Simply slow down this exchange, either by processing your emails in a batch at the end of the day or adjusting your email settings to send off emails at a selected time in the future. Not only will you receive fewer emails, but the emails you _do_ get will be more thoughtful—by taking the pressure of a quick response off the other party, you allow them time to think through their response.
>     
> 
> Adam Grant, author of _[Give and Take](https://www.shortform.com/app/book/give-and-take)_, says it’s okay to ignore _some_ emails—such as those from people with no relationship to you asking you to share content on your social media or make introductions. However, he explains that [you should also think of your inbox and the way it connects you to others as a useful tool, rather than an annoyance or hindrance to your goals](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/sunday/email-etiquette.html).
