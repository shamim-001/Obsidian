# Creating a New Branch
This is where the fun starts. Simply type this command to create a new branch, so that you can work on a feature or fix a bug in isolation:
```bash
git branch <new-branch-name>
```
Keep in mind that you can only create new branches in your local repository (you will see them remotely when published).
By default, the new branch will be based on your currently checked out revision. If you'd like to start at a specific revision, simply add that revision's hash at the end of the command, like so:
```bash
git branch <new-branch-name> 2b504bee
```
Tip: Make sure you give meaningful names to your branches - something like "feature-being-worked-on" could be a good starting point.

# Switching Branches
To switch to a different branch and make it active (setting it as the HEAD branch), you can rely on either "switch" or "checkout". We like "switch", as it is self-explanatory and "checkout" can be used for other tasks, but both are valid.
```bash
git switch <other-branch>
```
OR
```bash
git checkout <other-branch>
```

# Renaming Branches
This command assumes you've already checked out the branch you'd like to rename (your local HEAD branch):
```bash
git branch -m <new-name>
```

If you'd like to rename a different branch, you should first insert the current name, like in this example:
```bash
git branch -m <current-name> <new-name>
```

# Publishing Branches
While you can't create new branches on remote repositories, you can most definitely publish an existing local branch by typing this command:
```bash
git push-u origin <local-branch>
```
Since you're not allowed to rename remote branches, you can delete the old one and then push a new one by typing these two commands:
```bash
git push origin --delete <old-name>
```

```bash
git push -u origin <new-name>
```

# Tracking Branches
This is an important command to create relationships between local and remote branches - since initially, they don't have any! The most common example is having a local branch track a remote one, so that you can simply type "git push" or "git pull" without additional parameters to keep everything in sync. This can be quickly achieved by typing the command below:
```bash
git branch --track <new-branch> origin/<base-branch>
```

You can also use the "git checkout" command to achieve this. If you want to name the local branch after the remote one, you only have to specify the remote branch's name:
```bash
git checkout-track origin/<base-branch>
```

# Comparing Branches
This is a very useful command when you need to decide if you should integrate or delete a branch, as it presents you the commits that were created exclusively in there.
```bash
git log <main>..<feature-branch>
```
Tip: You can also use this command to compare local and remote states, like in the example below:
```bash
git log <origin/main>..<main>
```

# Merging Branches
When it is time to integrate the new changes into your current HEAD branch, it is time to merge!
Merging consists of two steps: you will need to switch to the branch that will receive the new changes first, and then type the "git merge" command:
```bash
git switch <main>
```

```bash
git merge <feature-branch>
```

# Rebasing Branches
Rebasing is an alternative to merging - both achieve the same goal, but the Rebase option re-writes the project history. creating a straight line. As a result, you get a linear history. which may be preferred by some teams.
Rebasing consists of two steps: you will need to switch to the feature branch first, and then type the "git rebase" command:
```bash
git switch <feature-branch>
```

```bash
git rebase <main>
```

# Deleting Branches
When a local branch is no longer needed, you can delete it by typing the command below:
```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

Tip: If that branch contains unmerged changes, you might also need the "-f" option to force the deletion - if so, proceed with caution!
To delete a remote branch, keep in mind that the command is totally different:
```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

To avoid a messy repository, make sure you periodically look for obsolete branches and delete them.
