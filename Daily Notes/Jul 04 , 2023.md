I take a screenshot and it gets copied. Then I paste it on a obsidian note. If I delete the screenshot from my pc, obsidian still store it. My question is how? What is the process behind it. Explain it as simply as possible.


Ans:

When you take a screenshot on your PC, the image is temporarily stored in your computer's clipboard, which is like a temporary storage area. When you paste the screenshot into an Obsidian note, it copies the image data from the clipboard and saves it within the note.

Now, when you delete the original screenshot file from your computer, it doesn't affect the copy stored in Obsidian. This is because Obsidian creates a separate copy of the image within its own storage system. It doesn't rely on the original file's location on your computer.
