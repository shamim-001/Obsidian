**Name:** `useReducer`

**Explanation:** `useReducer` is a React hook used to manage complex state logic in components. It is an alternative to using `useState`, especially when state changes are determined by more intricate and structured rules.

**When to use it:** You should use `useReducer` when your component's state logic becomes more complex, and simple `useState` may not be sufficient. It is particularly useful when state transitions depend on previous state values and require multiple actions to update the state.

**Use case:** `useReducer` is suitable for managing state in scenarios like form validation, handling a finite state machine, or any situation where state transitions depend on multiple conditions and events.

**Example:**

Let's create a simple counter using `useReducer`. We'll define the reducer function, dispatch actions, and update the state accordingly.

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// Reducer function takes the current state and an action, returns the new state
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const Counter = () => {
  // Initialize state using useReducer with the reducer function and initial state
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this example, we define a simple `counterReducer` that takes the current state and an action. The reducer function processes the action and returns the new state based on the action type. The `useReducer` hook manages the state and the dispatch function, which we use to trigger the state updates by dispatching actions (`INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT`) from the buttons.
